00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
okay uh open up the public hearing on
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
good morning representative
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
Amman good morning good morning to the
 
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
the best looking Committee in the State
 
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
House Commerce
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
Committee so for the record my name is
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
Keith Ammon Hillsboro District 42 New
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
Boston not Vernon and line
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
bro uh two disclaimers I do own digital
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
assets and I'm also the chair of the New
 
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire blockchain Council it's an all
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
volunteer nonprofit
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
so having said that the the next two
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
bills are similar and
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
related uh this first one house bill uh
 
00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:10.269 align:start position:0%
related uh this first one house bill uh
3

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
3
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
310 has to do with uh stable
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
tokens and tokenize real world
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
assets it would set up a study
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
commission to develop a framework a
 
00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:25.959 align:start position:0%
legal framework for the state around
 
00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
issuers of stable tokens and in
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
tokenized real world
 
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
assets so a stable
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
token is a digital token represented on
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
the blockchain it's backed by US Dollars
 
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
treasuries and basically it pegs its
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
value to the US
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
dollar uh a tokenized real world asset
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
is very similar the asset backing it
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
could be gold it could be real estate it
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
artwork um anything value could back a
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
tokenized could be tokenized so the
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
tokenization represents ownership it's
 
00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:10.839 align:start position:0%
sort of like a receipt for ownership and
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
the value is it trades on the blockchain
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
an open public Ledger we've talked about
 
00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
these things before um a blockchain is
 
00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:18.189 align:start position:0%
these things before um a blockchain is
basically

00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
infrastructure a blockchain is like the
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
electric grid it's like the Internet
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's like roads and bridges it's
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it's a way to communicate
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
value value across the internet uh
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
across space and time and across borders
 
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
so if you tokenize a real world asset
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
put it on the blockchain that ownership
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
can be traded 247 globally in in a
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
frictionless way in an easy way to
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
validate that you have an asset uh you
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
have ownership of an
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
asset the reason why a study commission
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
is is the right thing at the right time
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
is because there are moving pieces on
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
the chessboard there are federal
 
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.269 align:start position:0%
the chessboard there are federal
legislation

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh Senators Lumis and Gill brand have a
 
00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:05.079 align:start position:0%
bill it's called the uh I think it's
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
called the
 
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
payment the payment stable stable coin
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
act uh and that bill has been worked on
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
since earlier 2024 so we want to see how
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
the federal how it plays out at the
 
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.069 align:start position:0%
the federal how it plays out at the
federal

00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
level um one interesting thing the state
 
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:24.519 align:start position:0%
of Wyoming has a commission it's called
 
00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:26.839 align:start position:0%
the stable token commission and it's not
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
a study commission it's a commission to
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
enact a stable token the state of
 
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
Wyoming is going to issue a US dollar
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
backed token stable coin uh on on
 
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.749 align:start position:0%
backed token stable coin uh on on
multiple

00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
blockchains uh and they're going to do
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
it with the sovereignty of the state of
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
Wyoming so that's kind of an interesting
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
concept that's not what we're talking
 
00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:49.959 align:start position:0%
about here this would be the private
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
sector doing
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
it the the chair of the Wyoming stable
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
token commission is the governor of the
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
interesting yeah Mr chair you're rolling
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
impressive what is his name again the
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
governor of Wyoming yes
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
yeah what is his name didn't he run for
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
president and then he that's North
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
Dakota I think you're thinking veto the
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
uh the other token leg type legislation
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
maybe that was Christy gnome of South
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
Dakota that you're think that's Christy
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah but was other starts with the B
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
what's last name uh I think bergam
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
you're thinking that's a different state
 
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.790 align:start position:0%
you're thinking that's a different state
yeah

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
okay so so anyway there's there's some
 
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
moving there's some moving uh parts that
 
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
would make sense to have a study
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
commission and the the reason is the the
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
state has uh its own sovereignty and uh
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
you know we can do things at a state
 
00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:59.030 align:start position:0%
you know we can do things at a state
level

00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
what a stable token uh
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
legislation regulatory regime would look
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
like is ensuring that an issuer of a
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
token of an asset back
 
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
token uh honestly represents the amount
 
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
of assets they have in
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
custody um so for instance if I had a
 
00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
Bor of gold and I tokenized it a
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
dishonest actor would say I'm going to
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
sell 10 tokens for my one bar of gold
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
and so you're you're representing the
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
fact that that ownership represents that
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
bar of gold you see what I mean so you
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
would have auditing this is just you
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
know thinking of it through you'd have
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
auditing uh of the assets and then you'd
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
have something called proof of reserves
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
on the blockchain where you would look
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
at the blockchain and say these units
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
add up to the assets you know that an
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
independent auditor uh you know uh said
 
00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
that you know signed off on you having
 
00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.509 align:start position:0%
that you know signed off on you having
those

00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's uh just rambling off
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but I have some
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
people behind me I think that would talk
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
more about
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
it okay so if I get this straight we're
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
talking about uh an actual commodity
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
because it's always been my issue with
 
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.870 align:start position:0%
because it's always been my issue with
digitals

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
digitals
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
that whatever the 39 digigit number is
 
00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:18.039 align:start position:0%
not a commodity to me it's just a piece
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
of paper right so in this case there is
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
an underlying value there is an
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
underlying asset right and that
 
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
basically you're going to
 
00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
offer stock ownership of that item yeah
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
and you're using this the crypto
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
platform as the way to do it right and
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
so the predictions of this Market the
 
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
size of this Market is something like 10
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
trillion do it's like a it's potentially
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
a very large market and financial uh
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
companies Banks Fidelity bny melon
 
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
they're all looking into tokenization of
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
real world assets and uh it's something
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
that the state I think should get ahead
 
00:18:00.029 --> 00:18:00.039 align:start position:0%
of so with I'll take any
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay repres M thank you so I'm
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
a little confused what what is really
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
the purpose or reason for this and then
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
secondly uh why do we need
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
it so uh second question first this is
 
00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
getting ahead of where the financial
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
markets are going so this is uh being a
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
step ahead of uh future Innovation so
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
that's why we need it um we want to
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
position our state ahead of the pack
 
00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:32.390 align:start position:0%
position our state ahead of the pack
right

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
um why we need it so whenever you deal
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
with just the virtual world when it's
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
just a virtual token there's no physical
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
real world thing behind it then you you
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need this but the fact that
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
we're trying the fact that you need to
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
marry uh tokenization with a a real
 
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
asset in the real world then you need a
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework to make sure that
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
there aren't bad actors issuing tokens
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
that you know misrepresenting the
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
value does that make sense okay uh I did
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
represent Spears next and then I'll come
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
side I kind of like the idea off the top
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
of my head but I have a contact in the
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
FBI and they said that both Wyoming and
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
North Dakota are the largest Clearing
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
Houses for money laundering in the state
 
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
and they do it with stablecoin so you
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
have't who is your Source what's his
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
name I've got it written H Haskins I
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
think is his last name but I can get the
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
details and give you that okay uh and
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
but and I have also read that in other
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
places so the the question is now
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
Wyoming and and North Dakota have set
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
themselves up specifically for that in
 
00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.590 align:start position:0%
themselves up specifically for that in
some

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
ways whether you want to believe that or
 
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
not you can do the research or I can
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
show you my research and I don't have a
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
problem if we do it and we just make
 
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
sure we're not going to be in the money
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
laundering business and so so that's a a
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
thing I'm concerned about when we set up
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
this commission I just want to make sure
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to be in the money
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
laundering business or the income tax
 
00:20:06.679 --> 00:20:08.029 align:start position:0%
laundering business or the income tax
Invasion

00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
Invasion
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
believe okay I said I go back to the
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
next slide so I'll be back over to you
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay okay represent
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank you Mr chairman um sorry
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh is there any advantage to having such
 
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
regulations done at the state level
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
rather than at the federal level which
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
would make them standardized
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
Nationwide well so the the federal level
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
has its domain and the states have their
 
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
domain and we were elected to represent
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
the states uh Powers right so that's
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
what we would be we would be protecting
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh in this framework so like as I said
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
there is some legislation pending at the
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
federal level but that doesn't
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily block States from doing
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
their own thing to to be to being like
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
the you know the the gold standard of
 
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
tokenized real world assets that if
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
you're following the rules of New
 
00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:10.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people can trust that your
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
asset is fully backed and compliant with
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
the with the regime of the state and so
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
I guess there you know yes at the
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
federal level and also yes at the state
 
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
level okay uh represent
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
churis so um thank you Mr chairman
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so the
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
question is that is this a different
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
token than Bitcoin you're proposing or
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
is it tokenizing all the assets
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
piggybacking on bitcoin or or some some
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
some Bitcoin related
 
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.710 align:start position:0%
some Bitcoin related
stuff

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.310 align:start position:0%
stuff
um

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
so Bitcoin has its own network and you
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
can there's there's a protocol called
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
tap rot where you can issue tokens on
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
the Block on the Bitcoin blockchain but
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
this would be blockchain
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
agnostic uh you you know an issuer could
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
potentially issue tokens on you know
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin ethereum salana Avalanche all
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
these top level blockchains and they can
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
even bridge between them so it' be
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
blockchain agnostic I think the way that
 
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
I'm conceiving this does that make sense
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
so it could be Bitcoin but also others
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's about storing the representation of
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
ownership on a blockchain
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
inquire so so are you proposing some
 
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.149 align:start position:0%
inquire so so are you proposing some
other

00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
standardized Co I mean coin so if if you
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
read the bill you'll see the the
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
position of the commission the the the
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
duties of the commission is to establish
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
this it's sort of to craft legislation
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
for the future does that make sense
 
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.190 align:start position:0%
for the future does that make sense
thank

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
you okay uh um I thought I I thought he
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
of him too okay fine representative
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
buroughs for the question thanks for
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question um here's my concern
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
I mean sometimes we have a commission
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
and to be very I guess blunt about it
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're stacked in favor of a
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
certain wanting a certain outcome and um
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying this is going to be
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
this way but it's going to be three
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
members of the House of rep appointed by
 
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
the speaker two members of the Senate
 
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Senate President and
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
the governor appoints some of these
 
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
other people what assurances do we have
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
that this commission will be balanced so
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
that you know we can get we can really
 
00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
un get a real good understanding of the
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
risks and the
 
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
benefits yeah I mean it's a great
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
question every commission kind of faces
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm open like I think this is an
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
average bill I'm open open to improving
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
the bill um I think coming behind me
 
00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to see uh someone talking
 
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
about the ulc uniform law commission I
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
think maybe UC well the ulc creates the
 
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.789 align:start position:0%
think maybe UC well the ulc creates the
UCC

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:05.799 align:start position:0%
UCC
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
right um so I think you know adding that
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
position uh adding a position like that
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
to balance it out I think would be a
 
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.789 align:start position:0%
to balance it out I think would be a
good

00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
idea okay representa
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
Gibbs uh thank you Mr chairman uh this
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
is actually a follow-up question um if
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government uh were to enact
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
a law regulating um stable coins and
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
tokenized assets um isn't it possible
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
that that would occupy the field and
 
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
block State
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
regulation uh not completely I think
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
it'll set some parameters on what state
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
regulation could be but you know as you
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
know our state has its own trust laws
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
that are different from other states we
 
00:24:48.909 --> 00:24:48.919 align:start position:0%
have state chartered banks that are
 
00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
different from other states like there
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
there still there will still be uh an
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
area for State involvement i' just like
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
to to add a lot of the bills that we
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
passed blockchain related have come out
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
of commissions like it's a pretty normal
 
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
thing it's it's a complicated subject so
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to have experts study it
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
and propose legislation so that's why
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going with this
 
00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
approach so even if the feds did come
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
out with their own plan it would be up
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
to whoever choose to um uh have this
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
Capital item that they're capitalizing
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
and having the using the blockchain
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
system to decide which set of statutes
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
which laws they want to be under do they
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
want to be State chartered under the
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
state law or would they want to be on
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
federal federal
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
law okay
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
represent uh thank you chairman for
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
taking my call uh my question is uh how
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
this is going to benefit the New
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident because if you have
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
done any kind of a demographics how many
 
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of the resident will get
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
benefit out of it and what is the risk
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh I think one risk is not having a
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
framework for regulating it and just
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
letting letting it be the wild west at
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
the state level right I mean the there's
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
a downside to not doing it I think um
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
you know how many of our residents own
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
stocks and bonds municipal bonds or you
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
know it this is this is projected by
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
people smarter than me to uh
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
become uh more and more of the economy
 
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
so it would allow our residents to feel
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable that a token issued by the
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire won isn't going
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
to cheat them right but it actually
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
represents the value that it reports to
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
so that would be you know a benefit to
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
an increasing segment of society may I
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
ask a followup question further question
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh have you done any kind of research
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire resident about
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
the impact on the Bitcoin or what they
 
00:26:59.710 --> 00:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
think about it before for presenting the
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
bill or something like that was there
 
00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:04.909 align:start position:0%
bill or something like that was there
any

00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
done uh so the idea for this bill came
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
out of the the governor's crypto
 
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039 align:start position:0%
Commission in 2022 so the governor
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
issued an order we had a year-long
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
commission and this this idea wasn't in
 
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
the report but it was part of the
 
00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
discussions around you know the I think
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
the clarification is needed
 
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
here we're we're not talking about going
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
into the Bitcoin or the stablecoin
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
business right we're setting up a
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
commission to decide what rules we
 
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
should have should someone else want to
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
start up one in New Hampshire we're not
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
going in the business with this no
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's we're setting up an environment I
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
would say represent salvi that uh what
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
this Comm committee has been very
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
aggressive in doing is always trying to
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
stay on the front lines of being uh have
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
as many different methodologies of
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
investing um and for instance our trust
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
laws um our family trust laws we've
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
always been out on the Forefront of
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
carrying these now to say is well how
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
many people are really going to be able
 
00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of it or how much is
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
it a benefit um I would say is more than
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
anything else we're trying to be a
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
magnet we're trying to attract people to
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
in to come to us to move to New
 
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or invest in New Hampshire and
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
and invest these prod and take advantage
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
of these products is it dangerous for
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
the state to do it no because at the end
 
00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
of the day if the product fails or
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
whatever they're doing the business
 
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
fails that's no skin it doesn't affect
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
us as New Hampshire it might say is oh
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
well New Hampshire shouldn't have
 
00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:42.919 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have created that opportunity
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
you could always argue said the
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know what's the matter
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
with you guys you know we're always
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
trying to do all this state-ofthe-art
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
Cutting Edge you know new just kind of
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
financial transactions but I would say
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
over the history um in terms of how one
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why trust law how comes
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
to you was coming to this committee
 
00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
rather Judiciary is because um I I was
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the of uniform trust code
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
and changing the uniform trust code and
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
I was the sponsor of getting of um of
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
the of I'm spacing out of the moment but
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
it was related to uh that the fact that
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
trust had to expire and we got I
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
sponsored that legislation so so the
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
long run we're always trying to be on
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
Cutting Edge to have all these new
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
interesting new methodologies of of
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
investing out there uh we did last year
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
we did digital uh digital assets so so
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're always doing this it it
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt the state we always have
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
the uh the Secretary of State's office
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
who does Securities and has they're
 
00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:48.679 align:start position:0%
always inv monitoring it they're always
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
involved they're certainly will have a
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
seat at the table of this commission and
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
they ensure that there is no potential
 
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
exposure to the state but that at the
 
00:29:59.549 --> 00:29:59.559 align:start position:0%
same time uh we we are always excited
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
about trying to take on new new things
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
that are Cutting Edge okay chairman just
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
may I ask a followup question to you
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
certainly because uh I just wanted to be
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
clear I'm representing my ward so any of
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
the constituents is asking me why we are
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
getting into why we're considering a
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
commission for a digital asset what is
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
the answer I should give because I
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
didn't get the answer we we should
 
00:30:27.149 --> 00:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
regulate it we should regulate it that's
 
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
the answer there is no downside and what
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
you can say to your constituents is this
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
is a uh that New Hampshire is is having
 
00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.430 align:start position:0%
is a uh that New Hampshire is is having
another

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have an investment
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle and maybe it's not affecting
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
them I mean I but I I I would say is
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
there a lot of people who have been
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
moving to New Hampshire certainly since
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
Co and and prior to that who moving to
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because we're Innovative with
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
these different kinds of methodologies
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
of investment oh okay thank you I go
 
00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
ahead okay representative Herbert
 
00:31:03.159 --> 00:31:04.990 align:start position:0%
ahead okay representative Herbert
Herbert

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
Herbert
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
um there's I think I've read that the
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
absolute total value of
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh the United States is about
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
$226 trillion
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
dollar now my question is uh had are we
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
attach um the those assets
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
as a available to uh um Bitcoin or any
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
stable coin or uh as as a legitimate um
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
representation of the dollar which is um
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
the the world's Reserve yeah um I'm I'm
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
having a difficult time trying to figure
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
out how the
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
connections um how are you going to
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
marry uh with the uh the concepts of
 
00:31:59.679 --> 00:32:00.909 align:start position:0%
marry uh with the uh the concepts of
digital

00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
digital
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
assets I just don't understand and and
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
is and my and my follow on question
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
is does the federal government have
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
endorse uh whatever we do because the
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
dollar is a worldwide currency I know
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
you're you have you're worried about the
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
dollar losing its Reserve status and I
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
am too because that would affect all of
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
our you know standard of living we we
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
our money would become worthless right
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
the eighth largest purchaser of us
 
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:34.519 align:start position:0%
treasuries is a company called tether
 
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
they issue US dollar back stable coins
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
they've recently moved to El Salvador as
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
their for with their headquarters
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
because El Salvador's friendly with this
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
it but it's it's the eightth largest
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
purchaser of us treasuries and they
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
tokenize the US dollar and it it trades
 
00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
all 247 all around the world and it it
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
makes the dollar uh penetrate markets
 
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
that it previously couldn't it can
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
penetrate a market where people just
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
have cell phones they don't need a bank
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
to you know have an account with the
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
bank so the US dollar can penetrate
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
further around the world because it's
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
tokenized and that will uh encourage
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
demand for the dollar like into the
 
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future so if you're worried
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
about the dollar tokenizing the dollar
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
is a positive um can I follow on I I
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
don't I haven't gotten a um the answer
 
00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
I'm the question I'm asking is yes in a
 
00:33:31.159 --> 00:33:32.230 align:start position:0%
I'm the question I'm asking is yes in a
legal

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
framework the dollar is the United
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
States currency correct it is used it it
 
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:42.919 align:start position:0%
has functionally U become the reserve
 
00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
currency for the world and now uh my
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
concern is that someone is going to come
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
along and say oh I have this tokenized
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
digital real world what ever and and um
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
we have absolutely no idea what the
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
ramifications are going to be unless at
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
least we should have the the the um
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate body which would be the
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
United States and Congress to say okay
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
fine I'm satisfied you the dollar is
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
just like the
 
00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
tokenized uh currency that you're you're
 
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
you're trying to that Mr representative
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
Herbert I would totally believe
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm I'm just wondering I for
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
question if if the answer you're looking
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
for is has this have the potential of
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
undermining the dollar and I would say
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
is that uh I cannot see that because I'm
 
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
looking at this as simply that the item
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
is like think of it as a corporation as
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
an entity and it's selling stock and the
 
00:34:57.359 --> 00:34:58.550 align:start position:0%
an entity and it's selling stock and the
stock

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
stock
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
that is the stock is being traded as a
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
token yeah and keep it as simple as that
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does that's
 
00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.950 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does that's
perfect

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
Al okay all right repres spe you
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned you mentioned something very
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
quickly in passing and I'm not sure I
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
understood what you meant by it you said
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
that let's say we had a gold bar and
 
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
somebody sold 10 tokens against the gold
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
bar when it was only supposed to be one
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then you said this way the the state
 
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire would ensure that it it
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
it was valid now I I do a little bit of
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
gold trading yeah that was just an
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
example of a an asset that's in the real
 
00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:41.079 align:start position:0%
world right it could be it could be a
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
picture I don't care what it is
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
right are we saying that the state is
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.270 align:start position:0%
going to
[Music]

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
guarantee let's say it is gold because
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to to represent gold
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
right or even land are we saying that if
 
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
some business sets up a a stable coin
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
kind of thing mhm and they followed all
 
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
of our laws and everything and how we
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
come up with it does that
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
mean that the state of New Hampshire is
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
going to guarantee that in fact by
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
weight because that's how gold is done
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
it's by weight to some number of
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
milligrams or grams or whatever it is
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
that that gold is physically
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
there uh I mean that's that could be
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
quite this would be up to the the
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
commission to decide but the way I'm
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
picturing it and some other states are
 
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
are you know pursuing it is the the
 
00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:34.599 align:start position:0%
state would require that if you're going
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
to issue a token backed by an asset that
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
you have to have regular audits done by
 
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
right so the audits have to be done
 
00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
quarterly monthly whatever whatever we
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
set up and then the state would verify
 
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
that in fact the aits were done the
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
state would maybe license or you know
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
provide a you permission to to continue
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
your operation as long as you're
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
auditing on the physical the real world
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
side and you're doing something called
 
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
proof of reserves on the token side
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
because the blockchain is open you can
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
sum up where you know all the token
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
amounts and make sure that they match in
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
in the banking world it's called
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
rehypothecation so when you put money in
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
the bank they lend out 90% of it sure
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
whatever right so you know
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
there that's why I run on the bank is a
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
problem the bank doesn't have all the
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
money the money's other places right so
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
that's called rehypothecation in this
 
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:26.839 align:start position:0%
situation we wouldn't want that we would
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
want one one toone backing and make sure
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
that people aren't misrepresenting that
 
00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
your token is actual ownership over a
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
set asset follow on it's just a follow
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
so what I'm understanding is I just want
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that we're we're not in
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
the business of weighing these assets
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
and running out the fields and making
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
sure the land is exactly what they said
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
we're just going to look at the auditing
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
Trail and make sure that auditing Trail
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
exists and it's valid exactly we would
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
set up the guidelines in which we would
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
allow that Arthur Anderson that so just
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
like we have the uh when it comes to the
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
stock market you know a stock a publicly
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
traded stock is still is regulated there
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
is an oversight in terms of they have to
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
have audited financials and they have to
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
document their assets and have to do
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
reports stock reports and stuff like
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
that but at the end of the day the
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
company could get wiped out oh yeah okay
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
and so that's the same thing with these
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
you really just think of these entities
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
is that you're all you're doing is you
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
are uh creating whatever that whatever
 
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
the asset is you're creating a company
 
00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:41.079 align:start position:0%
around it yeah and that company has is
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
thatat to how to have have ownership of
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
it is based upon U tokens rather than
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
stock issues I I I understood all that I
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
just didn't want us to be in the
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
business of auditing and then being held
 
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
responsible no no we would set up the
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
requirements that they would have to but
 
00:38:59.790 --> 00:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day John Hunt's rule
 
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
of lure will probably kick in of what
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
John Hunt's rule of lure why why do we
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
create licenses so can so we can take
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
them away yes okay and maybe insurance
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
is part of the requirement that we said
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
right maybe require in terms of in you
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
would normally would you say is who is
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
going to be responsible um whether it's
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
a federal state but again you're
 
00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
creating a the structure is under the
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
state law so in terms of our Securities
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
yes our Securities division uh is
 
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
ensures that the company that's
 
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in New Hampshire lives up
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
to it um insurance is an exact
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
interesting because insurance that there
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
is no federal insurance
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
regulations um and in each state
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
individual state that the insurance
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
company is domiciled in that State's
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
insurance department is their regulator
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
who regularly goes in and audits their
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
numbers and most importantly is solvency
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
go in there and make sure that that
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
they're really solvent so they got to
 
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
prove the
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
assets and there was a court case uh
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
where somebody a famous um uh called
 
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin crash was because the person uh
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
was using his tokens and he was
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
inventing a number of what he said the
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
tokens were worth but he had no
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
structure there nothing behind to prove
 
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
that those tokens were really worth
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
anything and so and and and he he went
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
to jail so right uh so like I say this
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
is not this is not
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
totally unbelievable but it's it's a
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
good idea that the state of New
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um is to again to stay out in
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
front of these new Concepts and new and
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's like it's like inviting a
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
corporation to come to New Hampshire we
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
want them to incorporate in New
 
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't want them to all go
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
to Delaware okay we got to stop that you
 
00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
know go to
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
well it was North Dakota we don't want
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
them to go to we don't want to go to but
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
I always thought North Dakota was one of
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
the other competitors in Delaware But
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
but so any
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
rate um this is a would you believe um
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
not really question I would like to
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
recommend to people on this committee I
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
think there are a lot of us who really
 
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a solid understanding about
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
Bitcoins and stable coins and all that
 
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
and there's there's really good
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
information on YouTube there's 98
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin it's a it's an educational um
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
videos you can watch and I I would
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
highly recommend it so all of us are
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
really up to
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
speed and and certainly represent Ammon
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
as a as a resource make sure you send
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
out that link to all the members okay so
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin it's a it's an amazing invention
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
and uh it's you know it's it's finding
 
00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
its way into lots of aspects of society
 
00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
it's been running non-stop for 16 years
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
like this is it seems like a new thing
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
but it's been running non-stop for 16
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
years and it's you know president
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
presidential candidates are talking
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
about it it's uh you know interesting
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
representative melier and represent um
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
nobody has said this explicitly but it
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
seems to me that this is nothing more
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
than another security that would be
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
regulated on the state basis and the
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
national basis by the security Exchange
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
Commission and and you'd have to this
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
case it's going to be State yeah it
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
would be a state well yeah say
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
exactly an you're it's more like a
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
commodity than a than a company right so
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
like a gold bar doesn't have like a
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
profit and loss you know statements it's
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's just a a commodity and so a real
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
world asset would be like land is not a
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
security right it's but but I can
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
securitize land I can securitize
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
anything and again unless I'm totally
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
out of it this has got to be a security
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
it is okay isn't that sense okay
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
represent Gibbs thank
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
you and thank you represent
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
Amon for um clarifying some of this uh
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
for us um and just for
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
clarity um one of the elements of the
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
regulation if such a regulation came
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
forward um would be guardrails against
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
the state um having any risk of being
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
held responsible if there were
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
fraud I think yeah I I agree with that
 
00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
the state has uh you know it's pretty
 
00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.069 align:start position:0%
the state has uh you know it's pretty
much

00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have much liability you know
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
if the state's not engaged in the
 
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
business it wouldn't have liability
 
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
that's the way I would see it but I I
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
agree that should be a
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
consideration okay represent
 
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
shes thank you uh taking a question so
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:43:46.839 --> 00:43:48.670 align:start position:0%
would you
believe

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
that we just heard about stock and secur
 
00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
securitization a stock has value based
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
on the profit the company either makes
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
or the profit is going to make so there
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
is certain backing behind the value of
 
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
the stock yeah similarly a currency for
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
example dollar or any any currency is
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
based on the GDP of the country so
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
everything is backed by the
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
real asset which is measured in terms of
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
tangible assets the demand for the asset
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
the question is that how do you the what
 
00:44:27.549 --> 00:44:27.559 align:start position:0%
you proposing creating a
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
digital asset and combining all
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
the you know assets like go gold or
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
whatever all the assets tag this along
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
this proposed asset I proposed token how
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
do you determine the value of those
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
underlying uh asset that you're going to
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
bring through this token what what
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
should be the so the market does that
 
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
the market determines the value as long
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
as the token represents the actual share
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
or portion of the asset as long as that
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
link is maintained then the market will
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
determine the value of the token does
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
that make sense what would no well let
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
say to you ises be careful when we J
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
about the stock mark because they they
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
say that the stock market reflects not
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
the current size of the company the it
 
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
it reflects what people think it's going
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
to be in the future you're you're
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
betting on their future with that stock
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that yeah and but that that
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
the reality is that um all they could do
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
they could the next day they could or
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
they they could be hit with a major
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
lawsuit you know and and throws the
 
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
company into bankruptcy even though the
 
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
the fundamental assets were all there
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
but that because they picked up that
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
liability all of a sudden it's but but
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
those are all
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
measurable uh all those those parameters
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
all measurable based on that that the
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
stock is determined or the currency is
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
determined what I mean I'm I'm having to
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
understand how are you going to measure
 
00:45:58.839 --> 00:45:59.510 align:start position:0%
understand how are you going to measure
the

00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
value here's what I want to do now okay
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
is that I think we all pretty much have
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
an idea what the proposal is yeah we
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
will take this up in our subcommittee
 
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
okay and we can certainly thrash it out
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee uh and and but I
 
00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:14.839 align:start position:0%
would say to everybody remind this is
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
just a commission doesn't mean we're
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're okaying it right we're just
 
00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
creating a commission to see if it is
 
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
possible to do something like this and
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
what would be the parameters and what
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
would be the things that it need to have
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
who would theer be participate in that
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank okay all right thank you very much
 
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
chair's calls on uh uh the banking the
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
sakim good morning Mr chair members of
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Seth Zaraki I'm
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
the general counsel at the New Hampshire
 
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
banking Department um the banking
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
department has no objection to this bill
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
or to the establishment of uh the
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
commission on stable coin um if this
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
bill does become law uh we would welcome
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to participate on the
 
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
commission uh the department doesn't
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
have any other formal testimony today
 
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
but um I'd be happy to feel any
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have I have a
 
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
question oh my God okay yes it's it's
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
it's just a it's just a for me the
 
00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:25.559 align:start position:0%
fundamental question
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
is um are we talking about a
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
currency or a
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
commodity uh what is what is I would
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
like to see a legal answer
 
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
determining where that uh this idea of a
 
00:47:41.599 --> 00:47:43.190 align:start position:0%
determining where that uh this idea of a
a

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
tokenization uh real
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
world fake I don't you know I don't know
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
how to describe it I I'm worried about
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
our currency and I don't want it to be
 
00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:57.750 align:start position:0%
our currency and I don't want it to be
attached

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
attached
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
to something I think is quite
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
volatile and and not well established
 
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
okay stick to your question you're
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
worried about how would this have an
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
impact on our currency I would like to
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
see an answer to this question from that
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
but you just repeated yourself twice I
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
just want to say you got your question
 
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
stated do you understand I'm asking I
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
understand exactly your question thank
 
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
you yeah so that's a good question
 
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:25.640 align:start position:0%
representative I think Regulators at the
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
federal level who who uh you know
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
regulate and handle the US currency
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
certainly have voiced concerns about
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
that with respect to stable coin and US
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
dollar back stable coin um and I think
 
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that the
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
commission would would look at on this
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
whether stable coin is a commodity a
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
currency a security um that would
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
require the input of Securities
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
Regulators Commodities Regulators which
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
I am I am not um what I can say is the
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
current regulatory framework um was not
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
drafted with stable coin in mind and
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
that leads to uncertainty um on the very
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
questions that you are asking um and
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's generally agreed that the United
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
States would benefit um from better
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
stable coin policy at both the state and
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
federal level and I think that's ex
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what this uh commission appears
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
to be attended to intended to look at I
 
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
want to know if it's a currency or not
 
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
it is not a currency all right it is not
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
a currency we've already been over this
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
multiple times it is not currency
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you uh
 
00:49:30.599 --> 00:49:33.910 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you uh
Charles

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
commission thank
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you chair H Vice chair
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
producer members of the committee my
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
name is Charles
 
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
money I moved to New Hampshire several
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
years ago a few years ago from the
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
University of Pennsylvania after I
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
retired and uh last year I was appointed
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
by Governor sonunu as a commissioner on
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
uniform state laws uh for New
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Mike you have to move close
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
to yeah is that better sorry I'm very
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
sorry uh I was appointed late last year
 
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
by the governor as a commissioner on
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
uniform state laws for New
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh all 50 states have such
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
commissioners uh many have more than one
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
um and they come up with uniform laws
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%
that we present to the states and hope
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
the states enact them and several very
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
fundamental laws in New Hampshire come
 
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
out of this uniform state law process
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
including the Uniform Commercial Code
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
Uniform Partnership Act uniform gift to
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
miners act there's a huge list of things
 
00:50:52.109 --> 00:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has uh has
 
00:50:52.119 --> 00:50:53.870 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has uh has
adopted

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh although HB
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
310 is not a uniform law that came out
 
00:51:03.069 --> 00:51:03.079 align:start position:0%
of this uh process uh it would be an
 
00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
excellent complement I believe to the
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
new article 12 of the UCC which New
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adopted a couple of years
 
00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.190 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adopted a couple of years
ago

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
uh article 12 deals with the digital
 
00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:20.599 align:start position:0%
assets the electronic record but one
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
thing it did not does not and could not
 
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
deal with is any connection between that
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
digital asset and a real world
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
asset uh because that would involve the
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
law of goods of intangibles of
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
intellectual property of real estate of
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
every kind of property and so other law
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
would govern that and how it's linked
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
and as representative
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
em indicated that the core idea here uh
 
00:51:58.789 --> 00:51:58.799 align:start position:0%
is that uh a digital asset can be linked
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
to a real W asset so that when you
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
acquire on the internet the digital
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
asset it carries with it the
 
00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:10.839 align:start position:0%
ownership of the real world
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
asset one of the problems of course is
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
if I were to invest in such a digital
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
asset hoping it carried with it a gold
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
bar for example or anything
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
else how do I know it's there do do I
 
00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:28.839 align:start position:0%
have a property interest in that
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
underlying asset or do I just have a
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
promise like a demand deposit from a
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
bank a promise that if you ask me I'll
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
give it to you but that's unsecured
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
promise uh these are issues that involve
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
consumer protection
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
disclosure uh and the the the core
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
elements of what what regulation of of
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
investing has to do uh so I think this
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
would very well complement uh what we
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
have in article 12 I listened carefully
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
to the excellent questions from the
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and if I
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly I think this
 
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
commission would be charged with
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
answering those questions they're not
 
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
questions that this bill would would
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
answer but the commission would be
 
00:53:21.549 --> 00:53:21.559 align:start position:0%
interested in protecting the rights of
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
investors in New Hampshire and the
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
rights of people who want to form
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
businesses the such as with these uh uh
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
tokens uh in New Hampshire in the long
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
run it may well be that there will be
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation of these
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
assets uh it may or may not be good and
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
we may or may not like it but there will
 
00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
normally be some room for State
 
00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
regulation but more
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
importantly right now we're not very
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
close to having a very thorough Federal
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
Regulation of these assets uh I hope
 
00:53:58.990 --> 00:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
they make more progress in the next few
 
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
years than we have in the past few years
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
but you know state law is a laboratory
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
it's an incubator it's a place where
 
00:54:09.789 --> 00:54:09.799 align:start position:0%
people try things experiment with the
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
regulation experiment with the private
 
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
law the property laws and and see
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
whether it works or not so I think this
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
is a a wonderful thing for New Hampshire
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
to be uh to be doing regardless of what
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
happens on the federal level uh you can
 
00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:29.799 align:start position:0%
look at the example of uh California and
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
see there are many federal regulations
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
which California has choosen chosen to
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
go further uh in terms of protecting uh
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh people that's also an area that New
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire might uh uh uh considered so
 
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh I think the questions are all good I
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
hope this commission could answer them
 
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
in a in a good way and uh uh I would
 
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
certainly support it so thank you for
 
00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:57.799 align:start position:0%
your time I'm happy to answer any
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
questions you might
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
have oh represent spear this is just
 
00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:05.720 align:start position:0%
asking your opinion and based on the
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
had a stable coin that is based on the
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
US dollar which there are some already
 
00:55:14.119 --> 00:55:16.190 align:start position:0%
US dollar which there are some already
out

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
there I could see a situation in which
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
the US dollar becomes spread more
 
00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
prevalent than it even is based on these
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
stat stable coins that is more people
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
might end up having access to those
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
dollars via the stable coins than what
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
they actually have
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
now is that something that could be
 
00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
envisioned yes I think I think it is uh
 
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
just like investing in mutual funds
 
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
which are very different here because
 
00:55:51.789 --> 00:55:51.799 align:start position:0%
those are securities allows investors
 
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
access to things they otherwise might
 
00:55:56.829 --> 00:55:56.839 align:start position:0%
not have easy uh easy act to asess to
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
but we think of a stable coin as being
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
pegged to the dollar but when you look
 
00:56:03.789 --> 00:56:03.799 align:start position:0%
at the ones that exist and have existed
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
there's a great variety some of them
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
work some of them don't some of them
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
involve substantial risk others don't
 
00:56:13.789 --> 00:56:13.799 align:start position:0%
and this is exactly the kind of thing I
 
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
think the commission would look into
 
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
what what rules do we want to set down
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
for people who say if you buy this stle
 
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
toin you have rights in a
 
00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
dollar uh those are questions to be
 
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
responsive Ro thank you very much thank
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
you uh chair we call on make the right
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Michael Yamauchi
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
uh I live in Bedford New Hampshire and
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
with my family and um my background is
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
just a entrepreneur and
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
investor I used to own internet
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
companies and I saw the digital age
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
blossom in 1994 currently I'm an
 
00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
investor in in real estate in both San
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
Francisco and New
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in the last four or five
 
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
years this asset called crypto has
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
caught my attention and I want to let
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
you know why everything that can be
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
digitized and it can be uh everything
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
that you own can be digitized and it can
 
00:57:41.309 --> 00:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
be proved that you uh uh it can be
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
proven instantly and so we need the
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
legal boundaries if we're going to do
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
this uh if we're going to you take
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
advantage of this
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
technology and this is why I support uh
 
00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:55.799 align:start position:0%
hp310 um I'll give you two quick
 
00:57:55.799 --> 00:57:57.029 align:start position:0%
hp310 um I'll give you two quick
examples

00:57:57.029 --> 00:57:57.039 align:start position:0%
examples
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
I received a tax refund check a
 
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
deposited in a local Bank in
 
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
Bedford not that long ago and they told
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
me that I have to they have to put it on
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
hold for uh 10 business days um I didn't
 
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
I didn't really need the check but
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people that do and 10
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
business days is two weeks I mean why
 
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
would a why do we need to hold something
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
for 10 weeks uh um because a check has
 
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
you know the a check has the proof of
 
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
work on there it has the bank account
 
00:58:33.789 --> 00:58:33.799 align:start position:0%
it's got the it's got the uh uh the the
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
the the account numbers the bank name
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
and everything uh and and you it should
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
be able to be proved instantly but it
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
can't it takes two weeks because even if
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
they got the money they want to hold on
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
to the check until so anyways you know
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying and and so there's a lot
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
of work to be improved there also
 
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
purchasing real estate closing closing
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
and selling real estate can be
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
simplified much more efficiently people
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
who own time shares uh can finally sell
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
them if you if uh in an easy manner
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
where now if you own a time share you
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
probably have to give it back I mean I
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
have a friend who just gave back two
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
time shares because you know they're not
 
00:59:15.150 --> 00:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
going to be able to sell it uh title
 
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:17.720 align:start position:0%
companies can verify titles easily and
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
tenant leases can be placed on a
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
blockchain for example to eliminate fake
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
leases that squatters can use
 
00:59:30.190 --> 00:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
to illegally take over the property so
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
the benefits are endless and we are just
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
beginning like it's 1994 in the internet
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
age so uh in closing I'd like uh uh from
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
cashing checks to high value
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
transactions uh in any
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
industry a regulatory framework for
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
crypto will benefit us
 
00:59:53.549 --> 00:59:53.559 align:start position:0%
immensely so if you have any questions
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
if not that's
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
ahead with your background um is is
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
interesting um I'm I'm what I Stumble
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
over is the is the fact that
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
um Can the dollar uh be uh so um used in
 
01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
that fashion I mean if it's a digital if
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's a digital
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
Network um I almost have no problem just
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
saying it's dollars I don't understand
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
why we have to say it's crypto or
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin or some other thing uh you know
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh so the advantages you you ticked off
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
to me I I think are um uh distributional
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
they're part of a process a digital
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
process that may be more
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
sophisticated but my my question to you
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
is why can't it be done for the dollar
 
01:00:59.069 --> 01:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
because the dollar doesn't change in
 
01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
value i i i the dollar is the dollar I
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
just might State my opinion in terms of
 
01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:04.839 align:start position:0%
the dollar you want to protect the
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
dollar right uh
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion all you have to do is
 
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.630 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion all you have to do is
just

01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislate uh that things like tether or
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know altcoins uh uh um stable coins
 
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
are uh a certain amount invested in uh
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
uh um invested in the US dollar whatever
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
you hold in cash you invest it in the
 
01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:33.799 align:start position:0%
treasuries you know or or something like
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
that and you're backing the dollar
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
instantly right right there and every
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
nation will use uh I don't want to speak
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
for the banking industry or anything but
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
every nation is going to use their own
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
currency but when you when you do it in
 
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
the US in the US you can you can set a
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
certain amount in in of uh of purchases
 
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
that you're holding in cash just in
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
treasuries that they're going to make
 
01:01:58.510 --> 01:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
money and and uh you know I think it's a
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
fantastic way to back up the dollar it's
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's actually I used to think of it uh
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh your way uh representative Herbert
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
but uh I think it actually is going to
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
benefit the dollar rather than hurt it
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
right now you're going to get a lot more
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
opinion close but not
 
01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
salie if you're still willing to take a
 
01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.069 align:start position:0%
salie if you're still willing to take a
question

01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
sorry now you need to have your mic on y
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
chairman uh my question is
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
basically see now when I sell the real
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
estate I get the check in my bank okay
 
01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
everybody's comfortable with that if I'm
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
going to get the Bitcoin
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know don't even know as of
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
now or I cannot visualize how to
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
what the value will be and how I can
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
sell it and what's there in the market
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
okay as a usual normal investor I'm an
 
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
entrepreneur I know it very well I
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
understand the process I'm not against
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
the Bitcoin but things are not clear to
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
me I don't know how things will be clear
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
to my constituents or my voters
 
01:03:23.309 --> 01:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
that I don't know Banks also saying that
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
they are going to support it state is
 
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
saying they will support down the line
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
for the commission right now so all the
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
big players are saying yes down the line
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
how average person will take this
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
transaction and they might get more
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
confused or they need to do a lot of
 
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
learning in that area how my resident
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
will get benefit out of it rather than
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
putting some kind of a more complexity
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
in their day-to-day life so let me
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
answer this question so here's the key
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
thing we're going to have a
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and in that
 
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we have the the duties of
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
this commission so your question we can
 
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
put in as the duty of the commission to
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
resolve is to give you the answer to
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
that question he can't give it to you
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
this document if we pass this commission
 
01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
you're free to add all these really good
 
01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.269 align:start position:0%
you're free to add all these really good
questions

01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
and make sure that the commission's
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
report defines and explains how this
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
will benefit your
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
constituents good thank you very much
 
01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.549 align:start position:0%

you okay got no more
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
cards close the public hearing we're
 
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
running behind so we'll start right in
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.309 align:start position:0%
 
all

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.549 align:start position:0%
blockchain Council which is a nonprofit
volunteer

01:05:33.549 --> 01:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
organization uh so I'm introducing House
 
01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.670 align:start position:0%
organization uh so I'm introducing House
Bill

01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
302 relative to enabling the state
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
treasury to invest in precious metals
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
and digital
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
assets so we spoke about tokenization
 
01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
um this this bill the simplified version
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh there's a statute sh uh
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
that enables the treasur to invest in
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
certain things there's a list of
 
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
approved assets so this would add
 
01:06:04.269 --> 01:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
basically precious
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
metals and digital assets above a
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
certain market cap to that
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
list um and the easiest way to do it
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
would be through an ETF so it basically
 
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
instead of custody gold bars in a in a
 
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
vault somewhere you would let uh a
 
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
financial institution you you'd purchase
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
shares of their ETF that are gold backed
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
right so that's similar to
 
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
tokenization um the reason that you
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
would want to do this we've all
 
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
experienced inflation the inflation
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
numbers just came out this morning 3%
 
01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:41.480 align:start position:0%
inflation still currently um you so over
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
a a period of many years inflation eats
 
01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
away at the purchasing power of the
 
01:06:49.269 --> 01:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
dollar this is my opinion this is how I
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
how I'm thinking about this issue our
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
our federal government is $ 36 trillion
 
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
dollar in debt
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
growing and you know bouncing from
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
crisis to
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
crisis every time a crisis happens they
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
flood the Zone with more money and that
 
01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
causes inflation if you have more
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
dollars chasing the same amount of
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
goods in in dollar terms the price goes
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
up right and so this would allow our
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
state treasure to to potentially
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
insulate some of our reserves from
 
01:07:25.119 --> 01:07:26.470 align:start position:0%
insulate some of our reserves from
inflation

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
you know protecting the value of uh our
 
01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.990 align:start position:0%
you know protecting the value of uh our
taxpayers

01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
money um we started talking we we were
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
talking last year about this we talked
 
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
about gold in a different Bill last year
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
so gold was $2,000 an ounce a year ago
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
and it's currently trading at about
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
2650 so that's a six a 33% increase in
 
01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
val in dollar
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
terms we were talking about Bitcoin last
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
year it was
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
$43,000 last year and to it's about
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
$997,000 that's
 
01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
125% year-over-year now past performance
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't predict future results but on a
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
long on a long time frame because
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
precious metals and especially
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
especially Bitcoin it's a scarce
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
asset so gold you have to dig it out of
 
01:08:16.829 --> 01:08:16.839 align:start position:0%
the ground with bulldozers and equipment
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
and energy and machines to get more gold
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
right so that a li that limits the
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
supply um and and Bitcoin is mined at a
 
01:08:28.749 --> 01:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
fixed rate um so over a long enough time
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
period you can protect your purchasing
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
power as long as you're willing to
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
withstand some volatility day-to-day and
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
the treasurer would have to account for
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
that but on a longtime scale both of
 
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
those Vehicles help protect your dollar
 
01:08:43.239 --> 01:08:44.309 align:start position:0%
those Vehicles help protect your dollar
from

01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
eroding uh because you know it's been
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
the history of our federal government
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
they're they're not managing our money
 
01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
supply correctly um we're still at 3%
 
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
inflation that's over a 10-year period
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
that eats away at your purchasing power
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
in the last few years we've lost 25 30%
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
of the value of the dollar you can see
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
that when you go to drive-thru window
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
and you pay $15 for a burger and fries
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's inflation so um that's
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do it would give
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
the treasurer two more tools in the
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
toolbox uh it's it's enabling it's not a
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
mandate and uh with that I'll I'll
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I'll answer a few
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
okay uh let's see we want start we start
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
with representative
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
Sullivan it's taking my question so I'm
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
just kind of curious right now are the
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
only tools that they have are bonds or
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
what Bonds in cash or CDs or what are
 
01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
they using now do you
 
01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:46.759 align:start position:0%
know uh so I I actually we actually met
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
with the treasurer yesterday and she
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
provided me a piece of paper that lists
 
01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
the assets and I I forgot to bring it so
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't name it off the top of
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
my head but it's in statute it's in RSA
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
6 if you have your laptop you can pull
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
up RSA 6 and see I don't have one list
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
check it out I'm sorry RSA 6 you said
 
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay um follow follow for the
 
01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.630 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay um follow follow for the
question

01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
so I guess you know I hear you with
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
respect to and and I actually share your
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
concerns we we haven't done a great job
 
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
with managing our money supply so like I
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
but does is do you have any concerns
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
that things like we start going into
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
digital coins like that seems like
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
something that has a pretty low barrier
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
to entry so while Bitcoin itself might
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
have a fixed number there's like a
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
thousand other coins out there you know
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
and so you can keep and presumably it's
 
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
just like if you're buying gold just to
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
hold the value right well that's also
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
impacted because there are there are
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
substitutes maybe not perfect
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
substitutes but there are substitutes
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
like silver or or platinum or copper or
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
whatever right and so you know those
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
the movements of those precious metals
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
do impact the the the prices of other
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
precious metals seems to me if we enable
 
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
the treasury to buy um various tokens as
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
they come out or digital currencies it
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
seems like that the potential for them
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
to be diluted is pretty high
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
particularly when right now we don't
 
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
have a regulatory environment nationally
 
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
or or at the local level to deal with
 
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
that that that's the part of this bill
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
that concerns me all right I can I can
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
answer that part if you want okay sure
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
um so in in the bill there is a limit on
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
U I'm just trying to find it here with
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
my glasses here
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
um it there's a there's a limit on
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
market capitalization of digital assets
 
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
and it sets it at 500 billion dollars
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
which is half a trillion so anything
 
01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.510 align:start position:0%
which is half a trillion so anything
below

01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
below
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
500 half of a trillion average market
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
cap the previous year would be off
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
limits and so that's see that's a check
 
01:11:58.030 --> 01:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
that's the check yeah uh on on you know
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
I doubt the treasur would want to invest
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
in meme coins you know there's all kinds
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
of meme coins and that's crazy
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
speculation so those those would all be
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh prevent prevented prohibited from
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
being invested in gotcha yeah
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative ml uh thank you
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman um I guess I don't
 
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
know this but um to me these are type of
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
assets that belong in a long-term
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
investment how much long-term money does
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
the State Treasury have do they do they
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
hold part of our pen funds so we we I I
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
actually learned about that yesterday
 
01:12:36.189 --> 01:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
meeting with the treasurer um so they
 
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
have an operating budget that's all
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
shortterm yep we have the rainy day fund
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
um that fluctuates in value there might
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
be some long-term possibility with a
 
01:12:48.629 --> 01:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
very small amount what we're talking
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
about is one% half of a percent 2% Max
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
right it's very small amount does it
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
well does a state do any investing in in
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
a pension so that's where I was going
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
that that's what we were told yesterday
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
that there are you know pensions have to
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
have 20year Horizons right so and that
 
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
that would probably be an area that they
 
01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
question representative Herbert uh would
 
01:13:15.719 --> 01:13:16.510 align:start position:0%
question representative Herbert uh would
you

01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
believe uh
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
that um the the
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
dollar is the strongest currency on the
 
01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.990 align:start position:0%
dollar is the strongest currency on the
planet

01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
planet
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
yeah would you believe that when people
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
say question for the question would you
 
01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
believe that uh when you say um the
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
dollar is um being
 
01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
devalued would you believe there is
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
never have we have never the treasury
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
has never lost or
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
defaulted uh on on the treasury
 
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
Securities and we bought our first
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
Treasury secur Security in
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
1791 what was the security it was a
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
treasury so so the my point I'm trying
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
to make is that when you start talking
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
about debt and it's out of control and
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing you are not really
 
01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
understanding a currency I think I am I
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
think I do understand it and I the
 
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
Dollar's value does the Dollar by by the
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
way the dollar so we we're really not
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
discussing the value of the dollar that
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
is not what this bills about okay so
 
01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
let's just kind of stick to the focus is
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
do we want to give the state treasurer
 
01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
the power to invest in a different kind
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
of product than what she has have
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
historically been able to do it's
 
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
another tool in the toolbox um it's just
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
just another V big Financial firms like
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
Black Rock I I just rattling off off the
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
top of my head they they suggest a 2%
 
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
allocation in Bitcoin for every
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
portfolio because it's it's a new asset
 
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
class so it helps to balance out the
 
01:14:59.229 --> 01:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
risk of your entire Port portfolio it's
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
a you know you're diversifying your
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
portfolio right EXA black rocket is a
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
huge Bitcoin owner yeah and so is
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
Fidelity there you go yeah so all right
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
represent yes
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
represent uh so thank you for taking a
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
question you stated in your uh
 
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
presentation the bright side of Bitcoin
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
going from 40,000 to ,000 in one year
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure you're aware that just a
 
01:15:32.189 --> 01:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
year ago in 2022 it also fell down from
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
60,000 to less than 177,000 yeah losing
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
almost 34 of the value how have you so
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
would you believe that uh adding that
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
kind of uh Security in the to hedge the
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
risk is it really hedging the risk or is
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
really creating more risk for the funds
 
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
well you're always retirement funds
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
there's always risk in an investment um
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
if if you look back at 10 years and I
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
will not uh I I totally disagree I
 
01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
totally agree with you that there is
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
volatility in in digital assets 100%
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
especially because you you but wait so
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
is the stock market yeah no but Johnson
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
and Johnson was like the one of the
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
hottest stocks around until someone
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
decided their baby powder was bad excuse
 
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
me Mr my follow question that because
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
the I because the main subject was
 
01:16:25.149 --> 01:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
hedging the risk wanted to add to has
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
the risk but here the risk is more risky
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
than the normal assets or asset classes
 
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
is much more riskier why do you want to
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
add a much riskier asset to hedge the
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
risk itself that was that was the main
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
concern fair enough good question yeah
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
good question why would you want to add
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
that to your portfolio so so it's a it's
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
an uh non an uncorrelated asset so as
 
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
the stock market goes down there's
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
potential for Bitcoin to go up right and
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
it it's it's not guaranteed
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
in any by any means but that's why you'd
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
want to have different asset classes in
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
a portfolio this is just enabling this
 
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
is this is not a prescriptive bill this
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
is just here's a tool you can use it if
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
you want to uh to the state treasurer
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
that that's all this bill does further
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
question you may inquire yeah a further
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
question uh well I did not still what do
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
you believe that I I still didn't
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
getting an answer that I understand that
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
you you want to have different
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
instruments for trading or for
 
01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
investment because your objective is to
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
safeguard the investment and also to
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
reduce to hedge the to hedge the risk
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
itself reduce the risk itself so the
 
01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
concern that I have I mean would you
 
01:17:39.149 --> 01:17:39.159 align:start position:0%
believe that adding such much riskier
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
asset which can lose just 34 value
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
within a year and nobody understand
 
01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
why and and and can gain 34 times value
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
in another year adding that kind of
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
asset to a to a fund to really reduce
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
the risk itself the objective I mean
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
investment is one thing but your
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
objective of reducing the risk hedging
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
and adding the riskier product doesn't
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
really VI with me fair enough that's a
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
personal opinion that's you know that's
 
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you believe yeah
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
would you believe okay representative
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
um my question um it's a little complex
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
but uh it has to do with what bit coin
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
is backed by okay um when you have a
 
01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
dollar inflation not withstanding you
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
have something that's backed by the full
 
01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
faith and credit of the United States
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
let me finish my question um when you
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
invest in gold you have something which
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
is backed by a gold bar when you invest
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
in the stock market you have something
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
which is backed by an actual company now
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
none of this is is risk-free I'm not
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
claiming that it is um the dollar may be
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
subject to inflation stock may go up or
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
down so may the price of gold but my
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
question is what is bit Bitcoin or any
 
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
other cryptocurrency what are they
 
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.669 align:start position:0%
other cryptocurrency what are they
backed

01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
backed
 
01:19:06.679 --> 01:19:10.430 align:start position:0%
backed
by

01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
um so it's backed by Bitcoin with its
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
proof of work consensus algorithm that's
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
footnote talk about that later it's
 
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
backed by energy and it's backed by
 
01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
mathematics that's what backs Bitcoin
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
energy and mathematics followup question
 
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
well here's the point at the end of the
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
day if the state treasurer has got to
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
stand up and say that the investment is
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
legitimate and you know who the
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
regulator in that case is the bonding
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
companies they're not going to you know
 
01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
we want to maintain our AAA bonding or
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
double A plus whatever we are in New
 
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire he is not going to put
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
something in her portfolio in our
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
portfolio that that bonding company's
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
going to say is that's some that's too
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
risky and so therefore there are plenty
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
of Governors to ensure that the state
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
treasurer won't do uh take buy a sketchy
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin asset that that they're you know
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
all they're saying is if that if time
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
change right we're talking about going
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
to the Future now if there's a point in
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
time that there will be a commodity
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
maybe with our after this commission and
 
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
years after this commission they'll
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
create one that's but is is a a very
 
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
viable entity then why would we want to
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
Bar the me from putting that in our
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
state portfolio if she knows full or she
 
01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:31.719 align:start position:0%
or he or wherever it will be then uh
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
knows full well that this would be a
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
benefit to the state um may I ask a
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up question yes thank you um so
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
algorithm uh yeah in in a way you could
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
put it that way sure yeah fair
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
enough okay and this is just a
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
conversation right every piece of
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
legislation is just a conversation and
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
we can you know set safeguards on this
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
or not do it at all right this is just
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
presenting an idea and uh right now it's
 
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
it limits it to 10% that's probably too
 
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
high you know 10% of assets we we can
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
make that lower so right um always open
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
to helpful you know
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
amendments one little question yes one
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
little question I have a little question
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
I've spent some time talking to the
 
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
treasurer in the past on other bills and
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
she seemed kind of conservative so when
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
you talk to her about this did she start
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
throwing darts at you or anything I
 
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
thought she would laugh us out of her
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
office and and she was very uh
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
hospitable and inviting and I I won't
 
01:21:37.229 --> 01:21:37.239 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't want to represent
 
01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
what our conversation was but I came
 
01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
with a needle no I came with that she
 
01:21:43.629 --> 01:21:43.639 align:start position:0%
was uh curious about it so that's that
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
her okay thank you very much all right
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay uh we'll call
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%

Bitcoin and digital assets at the state

level we have supported Bitcoin and
 
01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
digital asset legislation that has
 
01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
passed in multiple States and I'm
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
grateful for the opportunity to speak to
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
speak with all of you today critical
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state and of uh
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is to safeguard the value
 
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
of public funds that provide essential
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
services to New Hampshire residents We
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
Believe hb32 will provide New Hampshire
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
with more tools to achieve these goals
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
since Bitcoin was first regulated by the
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
Commodities future trading Commission in
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
2018 its adoption and utility as a
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
financial asset has expanded
 
01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:19.719 align:start position:0%
significantly leading to a dramatic
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
increase in its price over this same
 
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
period the purchasing power of dollars
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
held by New Hampshire has been steadily
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
eroded due to inflation by approximately
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
25% even Bond strategies have not been
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
immune since investing in treasury bonds
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
would have still seen a decrease in
 
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
value by approximately
 
01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
10% however just a small allocation in
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
into Bitcoin could have offset these
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
losses and you could have see all this
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
information in the chart
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
provided this troubling Trend
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
underscores the important need for new
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
Financial strategies in the treasures
 
01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
toolbox and to protect the purchas
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
purchasing power of funds and trusted to
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by its residents last year
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
Utah passed HB 348 which allows the
 
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
state treasur in Utah to invest in
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
Precious Metals building on this
 
01:24:09.149 --> 01:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
progress Satoshi action fund is working
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
with those Bill sponsors to increase the
 
01:24:13.149 --> 01:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
scope of the legislation to include high
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
quality digital assets such as Bitcoin
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
we are waiting and expect this
 
01:24:19.149 --> 01:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
legislative update to be introduced
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
shortly other states are following suit
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
North Dakota heard this legislation
 
01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday and we
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma Kansas Iowa Montana Utah
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
Wyoming and others to introduce similar
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
legislation one concern we have heard is
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
how the state of New Hampshire would
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
Safeguard its digital asset Holdings and
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
custody and and provide secure custody
 
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
solutions to ensure that digital assets
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
acquired are protected so we are
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
proposing that these assets are
 
01:24:48.109 --> 01:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
protected by robust technological and
 
01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:50.679 align:start position:0%
governance Frameworks the legislation
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
stipulates that stringent requirements
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
are enhanced and these options can
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
include either implementing
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
state-ofthe-art secure custody
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
technology or partnering with federal
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
and state banks that hold highly
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
regulated exchange traded products
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
Additionally the bill requires the
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
Investments be limited to digital assets
 
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
with the market capitalization of over
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
500 billion which ensures that only the
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
most established and stable digital
 
01:25:15.629 --> 01:25:15.639 align:start position:0%
assets are considered currently only
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin meets this
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
requirement under the legislation stable
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
coins must be backed by US dollars or
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
short-term government bonds and are
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
subject to us regulatory oversight
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
ensuring the stability and
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
reliability the economic challenges over
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
the past few years have underscored the
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
importance of proactive and adaptive
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
policym states that fail to modernize
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
their investment strategies risk falling
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
behind and losing their purchasing power
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
to inflation hb32 provides New Hampshire
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
with tools in needs to stay ahead
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
protect the services provided by the
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
state and serve as a model for other
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
states seeking to navigate the
 
01:25:54.590 --> 01:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
challenging Financial landscape thank
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
you for your time and I look forward to
 
01:26:00.189 --> 01:26:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
questions okay we are going to have a
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
subcomittee on this bill
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
okay you really need to ask this
 
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:09.119 align:start position:0%
question representa
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
gives okay well you know I just want you
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
to know we're going to be cutting into
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
lunch pretty soon here because we're way
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
behind go ahead make it quick um you
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
said that um currencies such as Bitcoin
 
01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
could be subject to Heavy R regulation
 
01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
are they currently subject to regulation
 
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
state or federal so the answer your
 
01:26:32.189 --> 01:26:32.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you for your question
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative yes though they are
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
regulated at the state level this is a
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
common misconception when people say
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
digital assets are not regulated they're
 
01:26:41.149 --> 01:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
regulated at the state level here in DC
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
where where I where I currently reside
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
um they're working on federal
 
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
legislation also a point of
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
clarification Bitcoin is money it's not
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
currency currency is different from
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
money currency can be used as money and
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
then also to your question in the
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
previous with representative emmen I
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to answer and say that Bitcoin is
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
backed by math code and open source
 
01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:03.229 align:start position:0%
backed by math code and open source
software

01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
software
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
represent uh thank you for any question
 
01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
I'll be quick I just want to uh um would
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
you believe that the financial crisis of
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
2008 had happened because of investing
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
in riskier and people didn't understand
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
the instrument like cdos which a lot of
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
complex algorithms which Normal
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
public and even a lot of banks and lot
 
01:27:30.669 --> 01:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
of financial wiers didn't understand
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
much now you are proposing uh in
 
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
introducing this in the treasury would
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
you believe that that's going to make
 
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
the treasury uh more riskier rather than
 
01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.189 align:start position:0%
the treasury uh more riskier rather than
safeguarding

01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
safeguarding
 
01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
it so um for my understanding and again
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
I don't come from a finance background
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
but one of the issues that led to the
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
2008 U banking crisis is that the banks
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know who hell who was their party
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
and so one of the key aspects of
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
blockchain technology is you can know
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
who owns what when now I do not believe
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
adding Bitcoin into this uh to the
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
state's balance sheet will will increase
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
risk simply because at the end of the
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
day you know the market is the ultimate
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
referee and over the last 10 years over
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
the last decade Bitcoin has been the
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
best performing asset and what I mean by
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
that is that it's like you know sure
 
01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
maybe an exotic car or a fine art
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
painting uh would have increased its
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
value more so than Bitcoin but I'm we're
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
here talking about a widely available
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
asset that's available to be purchased
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
by you know the common person as well as
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
States and there's been no other asset
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
that someone can point me to that has
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
outperformed Bitcoin over the last
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
decade thank
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
you okay yes okay okay all right thank
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
you very much for letting me ask the
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you for your expertise so
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there is legislation
 
01:28:53.229 --> 01:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
uh pending in many different states and
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that you were aware of what
 
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
what's what they're
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
proposing and uh in reading this bill do
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
you have any recommendations for maybe
 
01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
updates or something that we would want
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
to think about for an amendment or did
 
01:29:12.669 --> 01:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
you think this bill is similar to what
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
other states are
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
passing thank you representa for your
 
01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
question so truthfully what I really
 
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
what I really like about this bill and
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
and as as representative Ammon has said
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
before all it is is really enabling and
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
so and even in our conversation with
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
multiple State treasurers you know what
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
we really want to do is lay the
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
groundwork so that we don't expect a
 
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
decision to be made to purchase Bitcoin
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
immediately it's going to take time and
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
it seems like a lot of people here are
 
01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
interested in learning I'm always happy
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
to explain and and answer questions so
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
essentially for me I think this is a
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
really good stepping stone so that you
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
know should one two years down in the
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
future once every starts everyone starts
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
to become comfortable and can and are
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
ready to make the purchase and allocate
 
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
one or 2% into Bitcoin the leg work and
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
the ground work has already been done
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
and that you no longer have to you know
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
waste more time to allocate more into
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin because the last thing I'll say
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
is um you know I think a lot of people
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
didn't expect Bitcoin to reach 100,000
 
01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
and I fully expect this asset class to
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
be worth in the millions in the future
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
when I can't tell you but you know I
 
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
think it'd be prudent to ensure that you
 
01:30:11.109 --> 01:30:11.119 align:start position:0%
know this residents of New Hampshire
 
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
have access to the best performing asset
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
class over the last
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
decade great thank you very much thank
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.679 --> 01:30:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
Mii

01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%

01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
pass this out but I just did a like a
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
little spreadsheet and I have about
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
eight eight copies would you like why
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
don't you save that for the subcommittee
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%

01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
Michael yuchi I again I live in Bedford

New Hampshire with my family and um uh I

have two kids and a wife uh by the way
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
um my background again is a entrepreneur
 
01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
and investor and I appreciate living in
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
one of the freest States uh in the
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
country I support
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
hb32 because it's important that uh NH
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Safeguard itself from debt
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
and inflation that's kind of how I see
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
it I'm not trying to be political or
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
anything and that and I know
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative Amon uh
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh is one of the sponsors of this bill I
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
I don't know him very well I only met
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
him once before just as a uh uh only
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
talked about this once before and I and
 
01:31:37.709 --> 01:31:37.719 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you how um uh you know New
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has about 10 billion in debt
 
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
if I get that correctly I'm not trying
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
to um uh sound critical or anything it
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
has about 10 billion in debt as far as I
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
know and there's approximately 1.4
 
01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
million people here uh uh since 2023 I
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
could have that wrong wrong but um let's
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
say about one that's about $7,000 of
 
01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
debt per person family of four like me
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
is about
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
$28,000 so I was just thinking how can a
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
person like me a family person I just
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
take care of my family that's all I do
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not political I just want to take
 
01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
care of my family how can uh uh you know
 
01:32:17.149 --> 01:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
how can we deal with this and and I just
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
came to a thought of creating a Bitcoin
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
strategic reserve for the
 
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
state so I contact Ed my local state
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
senator I just uh sent her an email a
 
01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
friend of mine and she introduced me to
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
Representative Keith Ammon so um he told
 
01:32:37.629 --> 01:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
me about Bill 302 and that's how I came
 
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
come to know it and I and I thought it
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
was a fantastic idea especially because
 
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
it's much more
 
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
diverse it's a diverse fund it would be
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
a diverse fund uh of assets than simply
 
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
holding Bitcoin I mean you can do gold
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
and silver and as an investor I I'm
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
doing all of that uh on a personal
 
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
basis so some experts
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
say that Bitcoin has grown
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
60% since its Inception I know it goes
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
up and down but volatile but good
 
01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
investments just like the internet
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
stocks were very volatile Google was
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
very volatile in the beginning so some
 
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
others say when it when it stabilizes
 
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin can grow 30% a year and I just
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
want to present a spreadsheet you um you
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
can all look at it later uh I just want
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
to see what what a 20-year chart might
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
look like it's just speculation but I
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
just want to see what it might look like
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
in 20 years uh and so I would say that
 
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not a financial expert this is not
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
Financial advice and I can't guarantee
 
01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
any of these numbers but if the general
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
fund uh uh which is I heard something
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
like 250 million if it invested uh uh
 
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
you know uh invested a partial
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
amount in there uh and you know we're
 
01:33:59.709 --> 01:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
looking at right now and I didn't
 
01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
discuss any of this uh these numbers
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
these kind of inflation rates with uh
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon it just happens to
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
be by
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
coincidence if we if we're running it
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
around 5 to 10% which you know owning
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
real estate here in the in the state
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
I've seen prices almost double uh in the
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
last five seven years uh so real rate of
 
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
inflation at 5 to 10% there the fund is
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
theoretically $250 million general fund
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
for the state you're losing 1225 billion
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
a year in real purchasing power
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
so uh in short uh uh
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
hb32 makes a lot of sense and I ask you
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
to support it uh especially because it
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
has a chance to make the state very
 
01:34:50.109 --> 01:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
wealthy on the positive side thank you
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
for your time if you have any questions
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%

truly neutral money for the world that

anyone can use being truly neutral means
 
01:35:46.510 --> 01:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
that no one including our own government
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
can control Bitcoin and that is nearly
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
impossible to change but I don't think
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin is against our state's interests
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
the best governments in the world adopt
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin and I want my home state of New
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be an early adopter in that
 
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
group why consider
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
this technology is a lever a tool with
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
every new invention Humanity gets bigger
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
levers take the written word for example
 
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
what used to be done with large machines
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
like printing presses can now be done
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
with by tweets with finger Taps
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
similarly similarly in the field of
 
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
wiretapping we used to take specialized
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
equipment switchboard access and most
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
not notably warrant now is Trivial in
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
widespread to the point where the FBI
 
01:36:30.550 --> 01:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
advises a use spend and encryption for
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
Communications in the case of money we
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
are at a fork in the road the technology
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
is here and the quadrillion dollar
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
question is who gets to use the lever
 
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
the impact of our path is outsized
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
because with the technology we have now
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
removing the ability for someone to buy
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
groceries could like a tweet just
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
require a finger
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
tap if our adversaries are Russia and
 
01:36:54.990 --> 01:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
China our government should lean as far
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
as possible towards things that give us
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
advantage over them freedom of speech
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
freedom of movement freedom of money all
 
01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
lead to technology vov Tech
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
technological innovation and ultimately
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
bigger levers open systems like Bitcoin
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
are part of our advantage over our
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
adversaries I would like to see my
 
01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:15.639 align:start position:0%
government adopt this technology before
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
our enemies do so for the committee here
 
01:37:20.350 --> 01:37:20.360 align:start position:0%
are the three reasons to go forward with
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
302 Bitcoin isly aligned with the state
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's values holding
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin is actively choosing the path of
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
Freedom over total
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
control being an early adopter relative
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
to our peers nationally and
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
internationally is a great Advantage for
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
the system citizens of New Hampshire in
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
aligning our state with the vision of an
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
open Future puts our state in a position
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
to be a leader going into the future I
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
don't think the alternative is something
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
anyone in the state wants thank you for
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
questions I guess we're all set thank
 
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh having no more cards I will close the
 
01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:03.270 align:start position:0%
uh having no more cards I will close the
public

01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
hearing this is 359 so 302 okay uh rep
 
01:38:08.719 --> 01:38:18.070 align:start position:0%
hearing this is 359 so 302 okay uh rep
representative

01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you Mr chair my name is
 
01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:22.360 align:start position:0%

01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
Strafford District 19
 
01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
um I've been posting about this for the
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
last couple days I really believe that
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
people need to learn the truth in the
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
prepare um Gold and Silver Platinum sure
 
01:38:37.589 --> 01:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
we could do that I I think that thinking
 
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
about how it would be stored in all of
 
01:38:42.589 --> 01:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
those types of things creates um some
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
issues but Bitcoin hard no it's also
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional Article 1 Section 10
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
Clause one is clear no State shall enter
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
into any treaty Alliance or
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
Confederation Grant letters of Mark or
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
reprisal coin money admit bills of
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
credit make anything but gold and silver
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
coin ATT tender and payment of debts we
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
should all know that because we took a
 
01:39:05.669 --> 01:39:05.679 align:start position:0%
oath to both the New Hampshire and the
 
01:39:05.679 --> 01:39:07.229 align:start position:0%
oath to both the New Hampshire and the
US

01:39:07.229 --> 01:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
US
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution I believe it's an
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely ludicrous idea I've got no
 
01:39:13.870 --> 01:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
issue with the idea of government
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
holding Bitcoin assets they've seized to
 
01:39:19.149 --> 01:39:19.159 align:start position:0%
be sold off either small portions at a
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
time or utilized in situations where
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin assets could be used in some
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
kind of law enforcement sting operation
 
01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
but the idea that we'd put tax revenue
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
into acquiring more of a very volatile
 
01:39:34.270 --> 01:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
asset that has no obviously obvious
 
01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
day-to-day use feels more like economic
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
gamesmanship versus a logical strategic
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
move oil we can understand reserves as
 
01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
well as food ammunition Etc if Bitcoin
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
actually had succeeded in its initial
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
aim of becoming a digital fiat currency
 
01:39:55.149 --> 01:39:55.159 align:start position:0%
there would be some logic to it but with
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
the Absurd price points per coin these
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
days it's just become another tool for
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
investment and speculation the elite
 
01:40:04.109 --> 01:40:04.119 align:start position:0%
Powers try to destroy everything that's
 
01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
money related that is truly private
 
01:40:08.990 --> 01:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
meaning Not underneath government World
 
01:40:13.589 --> 01:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
Bank cbdc tethers AKA any peer-to-peer
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
electronic cash systems with their own
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
economies this is done through
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
delistings censoring Banning of accounts
 
01:40:24.709 --> 01:40:24.719 align:start position:0%
and price suppression they know people
 
01:40:27.790 --> 01:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
can have money freedom only by private
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
means backed by legit money not
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
paper so this is a big huge um news it's
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
happening of course on a national level
 
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
um but I think everybody especially if
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
you have a subcommittee you should all
 
01:40:45.070 --> 01:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
probably buy the book and I'll buy it
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
for you it's called hijacking Bitcoin so
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
Al savador Bitcoin experiment um has
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
failed um the shivo wallet is going to
 
01:40:57.310 --> 01:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
be shut down El Salvador now has to
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
collect taxes in the US dollar Bitcoin
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
is effectively no longer legal tender
 
01:41:06.270 --> 01:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
and the IMF which is the international
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
country um tether and Bitcoin strategic
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
Reserve could possibly become the most
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
significant financial fraud in US
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
history Bitcoin and tether need to be
 
01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
exposed before the US taxpayer gets the
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
rug out from underneath them and I also
 
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
believe that all politicians that are
 
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
proposing State reserves throughout this
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
country um should have all of their P
 
01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
personal conflicts examined so I
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill unless it was
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
amended to just include Gold and Silver
 
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
Platinum um and that's where I
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
stand fair enough thanks thank you very
 
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
much can I ask a question oh would you
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
question re in a post could you give me
 
01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
a copy of that please yes I will email
 
01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%

cards I will now close the public
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
302 and we'll get into our last but
 
01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
least okay
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%

01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative is the sponsor in the
 
01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:53.910 align:start position:0%
representative is the sponsor in the
room

01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:57.040 align:start position:0%

doj and the consumer protection and
 
01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
antitrust Bureau I am here primarily
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
regarding um the two Provisions that
 
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
make a violation of this act an unfair
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
or deceptive actor practice under the
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act RSA
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%

358a um there is an exemption under RSA
3

01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
3
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
35831 um that exempts from our statute
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
um trade or Commerce right under the
 
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of banking or insurance so
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
we would be unable to enforce
 
01:47:08.719 --> 01:47:10.790 align:start position:0%
we would be unable to enforce
this

01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
so I have to admit as the architect of
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
that statute is I was wondering how why
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
she was in here and now I know so here
 
01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%

Seth

01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
Seth
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
saraki um thank you for the opportunity
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
to provide testimony on this bill we're
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
going to keep it real short because um
 
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
this is very similar to a bill that came
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
before you um I think last session or
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the session before it um my
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
testimony is largely the same the only
 
01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
addition that I would point out from the
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
start is that we did not get a fiscal
 
01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
note request for this bill um and I do
 
01:48:36.430 --> 01:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
believe that if we were to have to
 
01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
enforce this bill or the text of this
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill um we would need probably an
 
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
attorney as well as a financial examiner
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
I would in anticipate an increased
 
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
volume of complaints that we would have
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
to process um and it would probably take
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
that amount of staff to do that because
 
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
this is something totally new um we
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
would have a lot of issues to work out
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
with it um so that would be a difference
 
01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
from I believe the last time we got a
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note request um so that's one
 
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
thing and then we have a a myriad of
 
01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
enforceability issues that I'm happy to
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
go through at a subcommittee on this if
 
01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
necessary um but I don't want to belabor
 
01:49:15.790 --> 01:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
it so if you would like to hear those I
 
01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:17.639 align:start position:0%
can go through them but happy to well I
 
01:49:17.639 --> 01:49:19.430 align:start position:0%
can go through them but happy to well I
guess

01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
um how often you've had complaints never
 
01:49:25.070 --> 01:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
not You' never heard on this subject
 
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
matter no no one's ever called up and
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
said you know I get I get no but
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes when laws like this if it were
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
to pass I would anticipate some
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
confusion um and generally confusion
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
generates calls and inquiries and
 
01:49:41.229 --> 01:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
complaints um from consumers so we've
 
01:49:44.669 --> 01:49:44.679 align:start position:0%
had nothing to date um additionally this
 
01:49:47.709 --> 01:49:47.719 align:start position:0%
bill seems to Encompass National Banks
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
which we don't have jurisdiction over
 
01:49:52.350 --> 01:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
anyways um anyways um I think it would
 
01:49:55.149 --> 01:49:55.159 align:start position:0%
probably we create conflicts with um
 
01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
several federal laws that banks have to
 
01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
comply with um that we do examine for
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
such as Bank secrecy act um countering
 
01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
the finance of terrorism anti-money
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
laundering laws
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
um I think that's right not withstanding
 
01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's an actual
 
01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
exemption under the consumer protection
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
statute so that that you're this because
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
it I I didn't did did it refer to your
 
01:50:22.709 --> 01:50:22.719 align:start position:0%
statute it's in our statute so they're
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
putting it into our I don't that's 358a
 
01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
no 3 yeah 3 no 383a is our statute okay
 
01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
so so the AG and we do so we can
 
01:50:36.750 --> 01:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
investigate unfair and deceptive acts
 
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
right well I know you have that yes so I
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
think I don't know that's the whole
 
01:50:42.510 --> 01:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
reason why we Exempted you from three
 
01:50:44.109 --> 01:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
correct is because you already had your
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
own separate correct okay all
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
right any questions from the committee

control Law Firm here in conquer
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
um uh as you've heard this is this is
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
very similar to past two proposals that
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
this committee has heard um just like
 
01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
those past two proposals we were in
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
strong opposition uh to those um and
 
01:52:07.229 --> 01:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
I'll just highlight the reasons why um
 
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
I've passed around my testimony which
 
01:52:12.669 --> 01:52:12.679 align:start position:0%
will elaborate on these reasons but um
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
I'll just start with a VI it's a
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
violation of the free market principles
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
um it's unnecessary and duplicative um
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
it creates a scenario where Banks would
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
be guilty until proven innocent and a
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
lot there are scenarios where it would
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
be very difficult for them to prove
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
their innocence um it would erode uh
 
01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
risk-based decision making increases
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
Regulatory and legal uncertainty and um
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
there's several unattended consequences
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
for consumers including but not limited
 
01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
to potential of um limiting banking
 
01:52:48.910 --> 01:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh due to the um impact
 
01:52:50.910 --> 01:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
that this potentially could have on
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
smaller banks that would just decide to
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
leave the market um so with that I will
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
conclude my brief testimony and uh
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
opening up for any questions committee
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
members may have or if there's anything
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
Rob would like to add I would just say
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
that I'll I'll second what commissioner
 
01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
garyi said in terms of the concerns of
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
reconciling this with national and uh
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%

minutes well since you wrote half of
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%

read

01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%

01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
the committee happy to be here
 
01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
here still this morning and I will be
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
very brief I'm here on behalf of two
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
clients one is the New Hampshire
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
Association of domestic insurance
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
companies uh and the second is the
 
01:54:08.669 --> 01:54:08.679 align:start position:0%
American property and casual insurance
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
Association together they represent
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
companies that write most of the
 
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
property Casualty Insurance business in
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire I did bring
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
these books along
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
to take a EXC journey through these are
 
01:54:27.149 --> 01:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
the insurance statutes that there there
 
01:54:30.189 --> 01:54:30.199 align:start position:0%
are 36 of these volumes and two of them
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
are devoted to insurance and insurance
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
regulation um the point being that the
 
01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
behaviors that are described in this
 
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
bill uh most of them that would not be
 
01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
allowed and are not engaged in by uh
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
insurance companies they're prohibited
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
under existing statutes and some of them
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
are behaviors that the way they are
 
01:54:59.229 --> 01:54:59.239 align:start position:0%
written uh would prohibit uh
 
01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
underwriting activity that is important
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh to insurance companies and and that
 
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
benefits the public because of the way
 
01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
it's drafted so I'm happy to leave it at
 
01:55:14.589 --> 01:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman and answer any
 
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you all right you really

impress everybody this
 
01:55:25.229 --> 01:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
time all all right he is in opposition
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
to the bill correct okay so uh then we
 
01:55:41.069 --> 01:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
Farm good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Kiren
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
Schultz I'm here with my colleague Jim
 
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
hadam uh and we're here on behalf of
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
State Farm insurance companies uh they
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
are one of the leading writers of auto
 
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
and home insurance in the United States
 
01:55:58.109 --> 01:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
and here in New Hampshire um we would
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
like to respectfully note our opposition
 
01:56:04.589 --> 01:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
to HB 359 as drafted and very briefly uh
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a healthy market for
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
homeowners and auto insurance as it is
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
um what works best for a healthy Market
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
is that insurance is readily available
 
01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:15.030 align:start position:0%
is that insurance is readily available
and

01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
affordable and underwriting freedom is
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
key to the availability and
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
affordability of insurance this Bill
 
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
appears uh intended to restrict those
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
freedoms and that would uh most likely
 
01:56:31.709 --> 01:56:31.719 align:start position:0%
pass along the risks relating to
 
01:56:34.109 --> 01:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
protected classes under this bill uh to
 
01:56:34.119 --> 01:56:35.030 align:start position:0%
protected classes under this bill uh to
other

01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:56:37.629 --> 01:56:37.639 align:start position:0%
consumers and insurance companies we
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
think do best in contributing to the
 
01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
healthy Market environment when they're
 
01:56:43.709 --> 01:56:43.719 align:start position:0%
able to price risk
 
01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh in their premiums and
 
01:56:49.229 --> 01:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
when we start Crossing off of the list
 
01:56:50.669 --> 01:56:50.679 align:start position:0%
some things that they're allowed to
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
consider or not we need to be be really
 
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
careful about that and so at a high
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
level those are our reasons for opposing
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.550 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm happy to take any questions

uh just like to briefly uh reiterate
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
some of the remarks the people have made
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
and as George showed with this analog
 
01:57:30.669 --> 01:57:30.679 align:start position:0%
display of the of the uh highly
 
01:57:33.149 --> 01:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
regulated industry the industry has been
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
regulated uh and has the opportunity uh
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
to self-regulate itself through the
 
01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance the
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative hunt in his past uh
 
01:57:44.109 --> 01:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
efforts created the uh ability for the
 
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
insurance department to actually find uh
 
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
insurers for misconduct and uh as you
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
saw earlier the um the industry because
 
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
we're already highly regul there's
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill that isn't covered
 
01:57:58.350 --> 01:57:58.360 align:start position:0%
today by the insurance by the insurance
 
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
department so as you look at the bill it
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
provides nothing that's not already in
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
place and we oppose the bill and we
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and effort and
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%

last but not least is Michelle VC from
 
01:58:20.109 --> 01:58:20.119 align:start position:0%

01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
well good morning and thank you for the
 
01:58:23.709 --> 01:58:23.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak it is New Hampshire
 
01:58:26.069 --> 01:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
businesses for social responsibility
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
we're over 250 businesses throughout New
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are focused on
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
sustainable business practices we are
 
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
here to um share our opposition to the
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
bill because we feel that it limits
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
businesses and their ability to be able

03:29:20.910 --> 03:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:23.110 --> 03:29:23.120 align:start position:0%

members of the
 
03:29:40.110 --> 03:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
committee um for those of you who uh who
 
03:29:41.469 --> 03:29:41.479 align:start position:0%
have been on this committee you know
 
03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a deja vu all over again
 
03:29:46.750 --> 03:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
and for you new new
 
03:29:49.630 --> 03:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
members uh buckle your seat Bel because
 
03:29:51.910 --> 03:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
you're about to deal with one of the
 
03:29:54.349 --> 03:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
most complicated issues this committee
 
03:29:57.750 --> 03:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:57.760 --> 03:29:59.710 align:start position:0%
 
years

03:29:59.710 --> 03:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:30:03.030 --> 03:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
so I will I thought I was close enough
 
03:30:06.990 --> 03:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
but is that better okay um so what we
 
03:30:12.590 --> 03:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
have here today is uh as promised by uh
 
03:30:16.670 --> 03:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
we left it last year which is that the
 
03:30:19.630 --> 03:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
insurance department was going to delve
 
03:30:25.070 --> 03:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
deep into the cost of ambulance
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
service the problem of ambulance service
 
03:30:32.309 --> 03:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
is that it's uh and and I'll be frank
 
03:30:35.590 --> 03:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's it is run by the you know many fire
 
03:30:39.510 --> 03:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
departments it is very similar to your
 
03:30:43.349 --> 03:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
fire department in your town in the
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
sense that uh you're paying for them to
 
03:30:46.560 --> 03:30:47.630 align:start position:0%
sense that uh you're paying for them to
be

03:30:47.630 --> 03:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:30:47.640 --> 03:30:49.229 align:start position:0%
be
there

03:30:49.229 --> 03:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:30:53.469 --> 03:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
and you could go a week with no
 
03:30:56.269 --> 03:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
calls and who pays for
 
03:31:01.710 --> 03:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
that the issue has uh
 
03:31:06.590 --> 03:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh comes down to the balance billing
 
03:31:10.710 --> 03:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
issue and the balance billing issue um
 
03:31:13.950 --> 03:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
we we in this committee have solved when
 
03:31:16.670 --> 03:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
it came to everybody else all other
 
03:31:19.469 --> 03:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
types of providers when there was
 
03:31:21.389 --> 03:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
balance building involved we we've been
 
03:31:23.870 --> 03:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
able to solve that issue but this is the
 
03:31:25.389 --> 03:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
one that hangs out
 
03:31:28.110 --> 03:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
there uh even the federal government
 
03:31:29.790 --> 03:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
they would they dealt with it when it
 
03:31:32.910 --> 03:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
came to helicopters and ambulance
 
03:31:35.469 --> 03:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
service but they left this one hanging
 
03:31:38.389 --> 03:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
out there with no
 
03:31:40.550 --> 03:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
resolution so we had the interns
 
03:31:42.550 --> 03:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
Department really investigate in terms
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
of you know doing an economic analysis
 
03:31:52.110 --> 03:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
and with the sole purpose of how do we
 
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
how do we get to a place where we can
 
03:31:56.389 --> 03:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
find to
 
03:31:59.229 --> 03:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
convince Medicare and Medicaid or
 
03:32:01.590 --> 03:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
Medicare in particular who was really
 
03:32:04.870 --> 03:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
the highest user of ambulance service
 
03:32:07.790 --> 03:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
how do we convince them to increase
 
03:32:10.990 --> 03:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
their reimbursement rates um is that
 
03:32:12.950 --> 03:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
we're taking the step that we're going
 
03:32:17.189 --> 03:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
to address it uh by having a good handle
 
03:32:21.910 --> 03:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
on what exactly it is costing for these
 
03:32:25.630 --> 03:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
Services um just to briefly you know
 
03:32:27.990 --> 03:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
describe the difficulty of the problems
 
03:32:31.830 --> 03:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
is this is absolutely an urban versus
 
03:32:38.429 --> 03:32:38.439 align:start position:0%
rural issue U and Ro is you you you have
 
03:32:41.070 --> 03:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
much smaller population and longer
 
03:32:45.269 --> 03:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
distances to go so it is just uh kind of
 
03:32:47.670 --> 03:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
exponential increases the
 
03:32:52.110 --> 03:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
problems so this legislation um will as
 
03:32:57.229 --> 03:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
you will hear uh does not please those
 
03:32:59.070 --> 03:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh in the fire departments now who do
 
03:32:59.080 --> 03:33:00.510 align:start position:0%
uh in the fire departments now who do
balance

03:33:00.510 --> 03:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
balance
 
03:33:03.590 --> 03:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
billing because we're going to uh in
 
03:33:06.349 --> 03:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
this bill we we're going to bar balance
 
03:33:08.349 --> 03:33:08.359 align:start position:0%
billing because we're saying we're now
 
03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
rates in defense of what we would do I
 
03:33:18.510 --> 03:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
would say here is that I I truly believe
 
03:33:20.830 --> 03:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service is like your fire
 
03:33:22.750 --> 03:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
department or your police
 
03:33:25.189 --> 03:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
department and that is you're it's a
 
03:33:28.510 --> 03:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
cost of the town it's a cost of the
 
03:33:31.710 --> 03:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
community and and I I absolutely
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
understand that um it's more expensive
 
03:33:38.630 --> 03:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
almost the ambulances are are you know
 
03:33:41.469 --> 03:33:41.479 align:start position:0%
we my County cheser County uh believe it
 
03:33:44.110 --> 03:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
or not is we actually we started our own
 
03:33:47.110 --> 03:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance service and and so uh as a
 
03:33:49.670 --> 03:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
member of the executive committee I'm in
 
03:33:51.389 --> 03:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
intimately involved in what is the
 
03:33:54.429 --> 03:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
financial burden that this these uh
 
03:33:56.830 --> 03:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
ambulance services provide to the county
 
03:33:59.910 --> 03:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
and the towns are that are using it and
 
03:34:02.469 --> 03:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
we see firsthand you know what exactly
 
03:34:05.309 --> 03:34:05.319 align:start position:0%
the cost is and it's and it's a it's a
 
03:34:06.630 --> 03:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
big Bill to the
 
03:34:10.670 --> 03:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
towns that's just the reality and to say
 
03:34:15.070 --> 03:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
is okay let's let's back Bill and and
 
03:34:17.870 --> 03:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
balance bill to the people who are using
 
03:34:21.670 --> 03:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
it um when you know like I say we don't
 
03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
do that for the fire if you're if you
 
03:34:25.309 --> 03:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
got if you had a fire in your house we
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
don't say oh but you're you're not only
 
03:34:28.990 --> 03:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
unlucky to have that fire but we're
 
03:34:31.070 --> 03:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
going to send you a bill because it
 
03:34:32.830 --> 03:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
costs us money to send those trucks
 
03:34:35.830 --> 03:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
there um I believe ambulance services is
 
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
similar to police and fire and yes
 
03:34:42.550 --> 03:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a cost to the town
 
03:34:43.950 --> 03:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
cost to the
 
03:34:46.349 --> 03:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
community uh but at the end of the day
 
03:34:48.790 --> 03:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
we'll do what we as a legislature to do
 
03:34:52.349 --> 03:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
our part by ensuring that the insurance
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
companies um are providing a reasonable
 
03:34:58.910 --> 03:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
and fair
 
03:35:03.229 --> 03:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
compensation and that's what this bill
 
03:35:08.590 --> 03:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:11.550 --> 03:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:35:15.710 --> 03:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
Sullivan excuse me so I know you said we
 
03:35:17.150 --> 03:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
here soon that
 
03:35:19.429 --> 03:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
the people behind you are going to be
 
03:35:23.229 --> 03:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
preferring balanced billing why is the
 
03:35:25.070 --> 03:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
current why is this what do you think is
 
03:35:28.630 --> 03:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
being improved in this thing versus the
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
current system that we have now which
 
03:35:32.269 --> 03:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
apparently people are going to fight you
 
03:35:36.429 --> 03:35:36.439 align:start position:0%
on done basically um what we're doing is
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
is saying that that for people who have
 
03:35:41.510 --> 03:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
health insurance you know have have the
 
03:35:43.830 --> 03:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
insurance that um they shouldn't be
 
03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
balance build and that if it you know
 
03:35:49.110 --> 03:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that the balance billing that
 
03:35:52.670 --> 03:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
occur is um we shouldn't be penalizing
 
03:35:54.309 --> 03:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
them because they call the ambulance
 
03:35:56.910 --> 03:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
service and that it is the end of the
 
03:35:59.910 --> 03:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
day that service being there is a
 
03:36:02.830 --> 03:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
service provided by their communities by
 
03:36:02.840 --> 03:36:03.630 align:start position:0%
service provided by their communities by
their

03:36:03.630 --> 03:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:36:06.750 --> 03:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
towns and uh and whatever however the
 
03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
town can work its best price whether it
 
03:36:11.950 --> 03:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
has its own ambulance service you know
 
03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
through the fire department or whether
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
in our case whether they use the Chester
 
03:36:19.030 --> 03:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
County one in my town we actually have a
 
03:36:21.630 --> 03:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that's uh it's just Jaffrey
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
and rench and they've had their
 
03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
struggles and and Lord knows they uh
 
03:36:28.670 --> 03:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
this year they're uh they they just
 
03:36:30.550 --> 03:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
bought a new half a million dollar truck
 
03:36:33.429 --> 03:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
and and and ringe is going to see a
 
03:36:37.590 --> 03:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
tripling of what it has to pay uh to the
 
03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
to that Ambulance Company um to help
 
03:36:43.389 --> 03:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
offset the cost of that new vehicle for
 
03:36:47.429 --> 03:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
question for question manire so
 
03:36:50.750 --> 03:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm just thinking if I remember
 
03:36:52.910 --> 03:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
correctly from the last time we had
 
03:36:52.920 --> 03:36:54.389 align:start position:0%
correctly from the last time we had
these

03:36:54.389 --> 03:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:36:56.550 --> 03:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
discussions it wasn't always necessarily
 
03:36:58.990 --> 03:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
people in the community who
 
03:37:01.710 --> 03:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
were the the PR but oftentimes it was
 
03:37:05.229 --> 03:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
somebody from wherever Boston on
 
03:37:08.030 --> 03:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
vacation I obviously represent Bethlehem
 
03:37:11.189 --> 03:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
Franconia there's Hiers SK
 
03:37:14.309 --> 03:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
Resort somebody gets hurt they get
 
03:37:16.830 --> 03:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
hauled away on the ambulance
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and then they are out of town like
 
03:37:19.920 --> 03:37:21.150 align:start position:0%
um and then they are out of town like
it's

03:37:21.150 --> 03:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
not so that just Falls purely on the
 
03:37:24.800 --> 03:37:26.150 align:start position:0%
not so that just Falls purely on the
Bethlehem

03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem
 
03:37:28.309 --> 03:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh and so balance billing
 
03:37:31.630 --> 03:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
would go after them versus even the New
 
03:37:33.309 --> 03:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Rep like I understand
 
03:37:34.710 --> 03:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of places in this this
 
03:37:38.910 --> 03:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
state where there are no tourism but
 
03:37:41.189 --> 03:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
where I live is it's heavy tourist our
 
03:37:43.590 --> 03:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
whole economy is based on tourism so how
 
03:37:45.750 --> 03:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
does it impact that because that to me
 
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
seems like a slightly different thing
 
03:37:49.269 --> 03:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
that if we got rid of balance billing
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
but simply had the people who have state
 
03:37:55.710 --> 03:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
state insurance um it might screw over
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
places like Bethlehem where we have a
 
03:38:00.830 --> 03:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
lot of people getting hurt hiking the
 
03:38:04.469 --> 03:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
franconian not or whatever um and you
 
03:38:06.389 --> 03:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
like like like how do you foresee that
 
03:38:10.189 --> 03:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
impacting communities like mine um I
 
03:38:14.990 --> 03:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's uh it it's a product of
 
03:38:16.630 --> 03:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
that community what you're what go the
 
03:38:18.710 --> 03:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
nature of your community I mean I always
 
03:38:20.189 --> 03:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
think about you know the old saying
 
03:38:22.269 --> 03:38:22.279 align:start position:0%
don't tax me don't tax him tax the guy
 
03:38:24.189 --> 03:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
behind the tree and the guy behind the
 
03:38:26.189 --> 03:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
tree was the one that came from
 
03:38:29.950 --> 03:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and so I understand that
 
03:38:31.550 --> 03:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
you know for some people that they would
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
say we don't have a problem here uh we
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
we the problem is is Medicare you the
 
03:38:38.750 --> 03:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
problem is Medicare doesn't their
 
03:38:43.110 --> 03:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates too low um and but
 
03:38:44.830 --> 03:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
obviously we can't we have no control
 
03:38:45.950 --> 03:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
over that
 
03:38:48.550 --> 03:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
we can hope to we have a process set up
 
03:38:50.790 --> 03:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
in this build that that we hopefully can
 
03:38:53.110 --> 03:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
convince Medicare to raise their
 
03:38:55.269 --> 03:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates but there's no
 
03:38:58.469 --> 03:38:58.479 align:start position:0%
guarantee of that um but at the end of
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
the day I yes every Community has their
 
03:39:03.710 --> 03:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
own unique situations I mean one of the
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
problems we have is people the the
 
03:39:08.030 --> 03:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
ambulance arrives and the person says oh
 
03:39:09.510 --> 03:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
I don't want to I don't want to pay the
 
03:39:12.469 --> 03:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
bill and says I ref didn't refuse to get
 
03:39:13.710 --> 03:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
into the
 
03:39:15.870 --> 03:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
ambulance and you know
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
nobody gets paid at that point
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
so it's a complicated problem but we're
 
03:39:24.550 --> 03:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a reasonable
 
03:39:27.550 --> 03:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
legislative solution uh for the best
 
03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
that we can do as the insurance
 
03:39:34.030 --> 03:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
committee here in the house and that is
 
03:39:36.269 --> 03:39:36.279 align:start position:0%
to is to at least make sure that our
 
03:39:39.710 --> 03:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
insurance companies um have a a re a
 
03:39:42.309 --> 03:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable payment paying back that that
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
that is reasonably rationalized and it's
 
03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
by actual aial studies of what it really
 
03:39:51.670 --> 03:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
you know what the costs are and um um it
 
03:39:52.990 --> 03:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
you know obviously it's not a perfect
 
03:39:55.710 --> 03:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
world because the reality is that that
 
03:39:58.030 --> 03:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
insurance is you know is it's only you
 
03:40:00.269 --> 03:40:00.279 align:start position:0%
know at best a third of what of the
 
03:40:03.750 --> 03:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance calls but but everybody you
 
03:40:05.990 --> 03:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
know you know there so often over the
 
03:40:07.429 --> 03:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
years I mean we have we'll have another
 
03:40:10.070 --> 03:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill that you'll will I hadn't got it
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
yet so I would have scheduled it for
 
03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
today but um which goes back to what we
 
03:40:17.990 --> 03:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
had last last year um where senat
 
03:40:22.590 --> 03:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
Apprentice wanted to charge 300% of of
 
03:40:25.710 --> 03:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid you know and you just you know
 
03:40:27.309 --> 03:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
to do a pick a number like that out of
 
03:40:28.990 --> 03:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
the air just doesn't make sense we we
 
03:40:30.830 --> 03:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
got to be rationalized we got to have a
 
03:40:33.349 --> 03:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
a rational number and that's that's what
 
03:40:38.590 --> 03:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:41.550 --> 03:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:40:44.670 --> 03:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
Spar so I watched all the videos of that
 
03:40:46.389 --> 03:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
they present did when they were going
 
03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
through the uh generating the the
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
numbers uhhuh and I know that they
 
03:40:54.389 --> 03:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
interviewed as many of the ambulance
 
03:40:56.349 --> 03:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
services as they could and who would
 
03:40:57.910 --> 03:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
respond to it they did a really good job
 
03:41:00.590 --> 03:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
of that and what the bill came out the
 
03:41:02.710 --> 03:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
one that we're looking at the 316
 
03:41:05.349 --> 03:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
reflects what the commission came up
 
03:41:07.830 --> 03:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
with so that part is good but my
 
03:41:07.840 --> 03:41:10.389 align:start position:0%
with so that part is good but my
question

03:41:10.389 --> 03:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
is like you mentioned the big hole here
 
03:41:16.750 --> 03:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
is Medicare people medic care folks do
 
03:41:20.030 --> 03:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
we have any leverage to push them to up
 
03:41:20.040 --> 03:41:21.670 align:start position:0%
we have any leverage to push them to up
their

03:41:21.670 --> 03:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:41:24.030 --> 03:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
rates do we have any way because when we
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
left it last year this is a federal they
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
said we can do something
 
03:41:31.149 --> 03:41:31.159 align:start position:0%
but all we can do is we hope that that
 
03:41:34.950 --> 03:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
by doing this we can then um convince
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare we can uh that that they the
 
03:41:39.790 --> 03:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
rat should be reflective of what we're
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
doing by our insurance so who talks to
 
03:41:45.469 --> 03:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
them we we all the insurance ins
 
03:41:47.590 --> 03:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
department will you they will okay
 
03:41:48.830 --> 03:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
originally we were going to try to do it
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
as a waiver but I'm not sure that was
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
but thank you CH chairman
 
03:42:02.429 --> 03:42:02.439 align:start position:0%
hunt no you're the
 
03:42:13.630 --> 03:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:16.670 --> 03:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
hun okay
 
03:42:32.070 --> 03:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
Stringham uh yes thank you uh Mr chair
 
03:42:37.550 --> 03:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Jerry Stringham I'm the
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
State Rep uh from Lincoln and Woodstock
 
03:42:45.309 --> 03:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
area uh this my third term here um uh we
 
03:42:46.990 --> 03:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
have a great ambulance service up there
 
03:42:48.710 --> 03:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's a nonprofit it's not a fire
 
03:42:51.309 --> 03:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
department uh uh thing I'll be heading
 
03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
up there tonight to listen to their
 
03:42:55.550 --> 03:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
presentations to a couple of towns
 
03:42:57.910 --> 03:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
asking for a lot of money just to stay
 
03:43:00.590 --> 03:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
in business um you know we know for the
 
03:43:03.070 --> 03:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
last several terms we've been dealing uh
 
03:43:04.710 --> 03:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
with the collapse of the ambulance
 
03:43:06.910 --> 03:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
industry I'm very appreciative of the
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
people here uh and I'm appreciative of
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
the work uh that led to uh to the bill
 
03:43:15.630 --> 03:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
being presented uh here
 
03:43:19.389 --> 03:43:19.399 align:start position:0%
um uh to move the needle towards having
 
03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
a viable long-term ambulance industry uh
 
03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
I um my background um probably more
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
important than I'm a State Rep is I
 
03:43:32.710 --> 03:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
formed a uh consulting firm in 1998
 
03:43:34.750 --> 03:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
called Medical Technology Partners which
 
03:43:37.630 --> 03:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
have run continuously since then uh we
 
03:43:40.309 --> 03:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
are a reimbursement consulting firm so
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
we get involved with reimbursement
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
issues Medicare commercial largely
 
03:43:48.149 --> 03:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with new technology or services
 
03:43:51.550 --> 03:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
and um uh you know help the people that
 
03:43:53.510 --> 03:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know have come through with with
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
Innovations understand the healthcare
 
03:43:57.189 --> 03:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursement system and how to
 
03:44:00.030 --> 03:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
integrate those things uh into what
 
03:44:05.149 --> 03:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
exists um uh so um uh myself and the
 
03:44:07.990 --> 03:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
people we work with are experts on um
 
03:44:09.990 --> 03:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
many of the federal fee schedules like
 
03:44:12.630 --> 03:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
the inpatient payment system Hospital
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
outpatient physician fee schedules
 
03:44:18.070 --> 03:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
durable medical equipment Home Services
 
03:44:20.550 --> 03:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
there's over 20 of them and almost all
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
of them Medicare tends to be uh the most
 
03:44:27.710 --> 03:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
expert at uh putting together the the
 
03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
fee schedule that other uh entities use
 
03:44:35.630 --> 03:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
as a basis for making payment um uh I
 
03:44:39.269 --> 03:44:39.279 align:start position:0%
have never as a uh consultant worked uh
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
as uh on the ambulance particular uh
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
ambulance fee schedule itself uh but
 
03:44:46.349 --> 03:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
there there's a lot of similarities in
 
03:44:49.070 --> 03:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
Crossing between one and another one and
 
03:44:53.590 --> 03:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
another uh uh there's been several
 
03:44:55.830 --> 03:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
important developments in the last uh
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
with the last term uh in response to um
 
03:45:02.670 --> 03:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
uh the basically bankruptcy and going
 
03:45:04.990 --> 03:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
out of business of many uh ambulance
 
03:45:07.229 --> 03:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
services including increase in the
 
03:45:09.429 --> 03:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates as part of the budget
 
03:45:12.349 --> 03:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
last year uh the allowance of direct
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
payment uh to ambulance providers as
 
03:45:17.429 --> 03:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
opposed to going to the patient and then
 
03:45:20.110 --> 03:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
having the ambulance providers having to
 
03:45:23.510 --> 03:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
try to chase down that money and then um
 
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh s SP
 
03:45:28.830 --> 03:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
409 uh which um uh Senator PR Apprentice
 
03:45:32.229 --> 03:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
championed uh here provides for
 
03:45:34.990 --> 03:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
insurance payment uh under the Medicaid
 
03:45:39.790 --> 03:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
Program for non um non-transport type of
 
03:45:44.349 --> 03:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
services uh in in um in the in the
 
03:45:46.950 --> 03:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
service uh in Lincoln and Woodstock that
 
03:45:50.670 --> 03:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
represents 39% of the calls so it's it's
 
03:45:53.110 --> 03:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
a lower be a lower reimbursement but
 
03:45:55.510 --> 03:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh than some of the other services
 
03:45:59.710 --> 03:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
but it's um more than zero so these
 
03:46:02.229 --> 03:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
these things we hope are are starting
 
03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
the process of having a financial model
 
03:46:08.469 --> 03:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
that actually works enough that
 
03:46:10.510 --> 03:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether this is a fire
 
03:46:13.030 --> 03:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
department service a for-profit service
 
03:46:16.469 --> 03:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
or a nonprofit service uh there's you
 
03:46:18.790 --> 03:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
know reasonable chance you know with
 
03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
with um you know not overwhelming
 
03:46:23.510 --> 03:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
Community Support to allow these to
 
03:46:26.309 --> 03:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
exist uh ambulances aren't considered an
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
essential service you don't have to
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
provide them um but I think we all think
 
03:46:33.790 --> 03:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty critical ele element of
 
03:46:37.149 --> 03:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
medical care and uh at a time time of
 
03:46:42.389 --> 03:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
life when when people need help um so um
 
03:46:43.990 --> 03:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to talk about a couple of
 
03:46:46.990 --> 03:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
the elements that are in this proposal
 
03:46:50.309 --> 03:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
um uh the the effort towards having
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable and fair payment uh from the
 
03:46:56.429 --> 03:46:56.439 align:start position:0%
insurance companies uh they talk about
 
03:47:00.110 --> 03:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
an all-payer model all-payer models for
 
03:47:01.950 --> 03:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare reimbursement systems are
 
03:47:05.469 --> 03:47:05.479 align:start position:0%
very unusual meaning that uh all payers
 
03:47:07.910 --> 03:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
would pay the same amount Maryland does
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
that for hospitals they're about the
 
03:47:15.630 --> 03:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
only one that does that um but um uh the
 
03:47:19.030 --> 03:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
um uh you know in general the much more
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
common commonly used 99% of the time is
 
03:47:25.630 --> 03:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
that Medicare serves as a base uh for
 
03:47:29.429 --> 03:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
for uh establishing other payments and I
 
03:47:33.030 --> 03:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
do think you know being someone who uh
 
03:47:35.630 --> 03:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
deals all the time with
 
03:47:39.309 --> 03:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
Medicare uh and uh that I don't think as
 
03:47:41.790 --> 03:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
a state either through the insurance
 
03:47:44.510 --> 03:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
department or through uh Henry litman's
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
group over in Medicaid services that we
 
03:47:50.590 --> 03:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
would have much luck influencing how
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to change change the
 
03:47:55.510 --> 03:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare rate because we have a a law
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
that says I if if the intent of of this
 
03:48:02.149 --> 03:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
rule as written uh is to have the fee
 
03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
schedule amount be the same from all
 
03:48:06.910 --> 03:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
insurers I don't think that's going to
 
03:48:10.110 --> 03:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
going to going to fly and I certainly
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't think it's under our control in
 
03:48:14.830 --> 03:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire um it does
 
03:48:19.269 --> 03:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
say public and private funding uh would
 
03:48:21.950 --> 03:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
be the same and I have a question of
 
03:48:25.349 --> 03:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
what public means because if the if the
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
public includes money that cities and
 
03:48:31.790 --> 03:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
towns uh just donate or provide as an
 
03:48:34.830 --> 03:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
access fee and that's added to whatever
 
03:48:38.229 --> 03:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
is paid under on a per per uh case basis
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
for Medicade and Medicare that's that's
 
03:48:45.309 --> 03:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
a very different math than what um
 
03:48:47.229 --> 03:48:47.239 align:start position:0%
what those in healthcare insurance
 
03:48:49.790 --> 03:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
industry view as an allpay model is in
 
03:48:55.229 --> 03:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
there um so um you know I think the more
 
03:49:00.750 --> 03:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
workable Solutions are uh to um uh is to
 
03:49:03.550 --> 03:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
Peg payment to Medicare rates and use
 
03:49:06.030 --> 03:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
current Medicare rates and and try to
 
03:49:09.309 --> 03:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
have a reasonable uh markup from that
 
03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
which um I think would be higher than
 
03:49:17.469 --> 03:49:17.479 align:start position:0%
the 209% that's in the report um be
 
03:49:20.670 --> 03:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
um uh the other element to the bill
 
03:49:22.790 --> 03:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
countering that is this balanced billing
 
03:49:26.349 --> 03:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
issue um balance balance billing is a
 
03:49:30.710 --> 03:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
problem uh people who need a ride and uh
 
03:49:35.149 --> 03:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
you know could could face uh severe
 
03:49:37.710 --> 03:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
Financial health problems with if they
 
03:49:39.870 --> 03:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
have a ride that turns out to be very
 
03:49:43.149 --> 03:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
expensive and Way Beyond their means and
 
03:49:45.630 --> 03:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
um I previous
 
03:49:47.790 --> 03:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
been against getting rid of the balance
 
03:49:51.670 --> 03:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
billing provision because uh there was
 
03:49:53.950 --> 03:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
no leverage between an ambulance
 
03:49:56.910 --> 03:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
provider and uh a health insurance
 
03:49:59.309 --> 03:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
provider particularly those out of state
 
03:50:01.149 --> 03:50:01.159 align:start position:0%
you know some of some of them would say
 
03:50:03.309 --> 03:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
our our non-contract rate for an
 
03:50:04.990 --> 03:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
ambulance ride is
 
03:50:08.590 --> 03:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
$25 and uh they're in South Carolina and
 
03:50:10.990 --> 03:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's they they don't have any
 
03:50:13.229 --> 03:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
leverage you know people ski ski in New
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from all over the country
 
03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
and uh uh uh in addition the ambulance
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
providers tell me they didn't really
 
03:50:22.429 --> 03:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Leverage and even
 
03:50:25.790 --> 03:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
negotiating reasonable contracts uh if
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
there is a bill passed whether it's this
 
03:50:31.070 --> 03:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
one or whether this is we reworked or
 
03:50:33.870 --> 03:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
one of the other uh bills that that U
 
03:50:35.710 --> 03:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
may come before this committee and one
 
03:50:40.030 --> 03:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
it being introduced in the Senate um uh
 
03:50:43.349 --> 03:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
I think I think the uh the that puts
 
03:50:46.189 --> 03:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
sufficient Leverage in with insurance
 
03:50:50.550 --> 03:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
companies that we can um uh try to try
 
03:50:54.510 --> 03:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
to remove this balance billing uh
 
03:50:58.229 --> 03:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
prohibition uh in ambulances and um you
 
03:51:01.389 --> 03:51:01.399 align:start position:0%
know I see you there there is there is a
 
03:51:04.510 --> 03:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
growing base with with the laws passed
 
03:51:08.149 --> 03:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
last term and um uh you know with
 
03:51:10.349 --> 03:51:10.359 align:start position:0%
sufficient payment uh from there it's
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
still still not going to guarantee that
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
every ambulance service is going to be
 
03:51:17.830 --> 03:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
viable or or not overwhelmingly in in uh
 
03:51:22.830 --> 03:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
inexpensive or expensive but um uh uh I
 
03:51:25.309 --> 03:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
I think it'll be a more traditional
 
03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
medical service business uh at that
 
03:51:30.830 --> 03:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
point and um I think we can do both of
 
03:51:32.830 --> 03:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
these things at the same time provided
 
03:51:36.670 --> 03:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
the numbers work out so um you know that
 
03:51:38.710 --> 03:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
is the high level I'm happy to answer
 
03:51:42.710 --> 03:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:50.830 --> 03:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to call up uh commissioner
 
03:52:09.630 --> 03:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:11.830 --> 03:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
Court thank you Mr chairman members of
 
03:52:13.590 --> 03:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
the committee DJ Bon Court commissioner
 
03:52:14.830 --> 03:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire insurance
 
03:52:16.830 --> 03:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
department I'm joined here at the table
 
03:52:19.469 --> 03:52:19.479 align:start position:0%
by my colleague Alex Fel Daval I never
 
03:52:21.750 --> 03:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
get his title exactly right he's our
 
03:52:24.750 --> 03:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
jack of all trades I'm also joined by
 
03:52:27.710 --> 03:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
Jason a is the director of our data
 
03:52:30.110 --> 03:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
analytics unit and of course Jennifer
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
Smith who does a phenomenal job for us
 
03:52:35.670 --> 03:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
as well so we are here today in support
 
03:52:36.630 --> 03:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislation it is a proposal brought
 
03:52:41.910 --> 03:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
forward at the behest of the department
 
03:52:43.389 --> 03:52:43.399 align:start position:0%
although there's a bit of a caveat to
 
03:52:45.149 --> 03:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
that in the sense that
 
03:52:47.229 --> 03:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
we were certainly prompted to do this by
 
03:52:50.189 --> 03:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
what you all asked us to do last session
 
03:52:52.469 --> 03:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
I want to start by providing background
 
03:52:55.870 --> 03:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
for those who are new to this issue or
 
03:52:57.830 --> 03:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
to those of you who have not followed
 
03:53:00.950 --> 03:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
every Twist and Turn of this story
 
03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
consider this a bit like the a big long
 
03:53:06.550 --> 03:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
pre- preview to your favorite show when
 
03:53:08.590 --> 03:53:08.600 align:start position:0%
they come back after the previous season
 
03:53:10.349 --> 03:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
ended they catch you up on things so
 
03:53:12.110 --> 03:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
that you know what's going to happen as
 
03:53:14.630 --> 03:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
the new season starts
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
balance billing and the inability of
 
03:53:19.870 --> 03:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
carriers and ground ambulance providers
 
03:53:23.229 --> 03:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
to get into contract or in network has
 
03:53:25.710 --> 03:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
been a policy challenge facing this
 
03:53:28.830 --> 03:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
state stretching back 25 years or so
 
03:53:31.950 --> 03:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
maybe even perhaps longer than that this
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
department for approximately that same
 
03:53:38.830 --> 03:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
period of time has taken the position in
 
03:53:42.750 --> 03:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
its role to protect and advocate for
 
03:53:44.710 --> 03:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
consumers again has taken in the
 
03:53:47.429 --> 03:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
position that balance billing a consumer
 
03:53:51.189 --> 03:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
is the wrong thing to do when I was here
 
03:53:54.349 --> 03:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
last week for the orientation I provided
 
03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
you with a little bit of an example of
 
03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
how balanced billing works I want to
 
03:54:02.269 --> 03:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
share with you again the example that I
 
03:54:05.630 --> 03:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
used using very small simple hopefully
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
easy to understand numbers so you or a
 
03:54:13.510 --> 03:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
family member needs a ride to the
 
03:54:15.189 --> 03:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
hospital from an ambul
 
03:54:17.870 --> 03:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
provider the bill for that ride as
 
03:54:20.750 --> 03:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
determined by the provider is say
 
03:54:23.550 --> 03:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
$1,000 your insurance carrier or your
 
03:54:25.550 --> 03:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
family member's insurance carrier is not
 
03:54:29.030 --> 03:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
in network with that ground ambulance
 
03:54:31.830 --> 03:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
provider with the carrier has set as the
 
03:54:34.510 --> 03:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
rate at which they will reimburse an
 
03:54:38.309 --> 03:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
outof network provider is say
 
03:54:41.550 --> 03:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
$200 so the bill is a th000 what the
 
03:54:44.030 --> 03:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
carrier is going to pay is 200 the
 
03:54:47.189 --> 03:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
question becomes what happens to the
 
03:54:50.990 --> 03:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
$800 and what happens at present is the
 
03:54:55.110 --> 03:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
$800 is passed along to the
 
03:54:58.990 --> 03:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
consumer now let's be clear the consumer
 
03:55:02.550 --> 03:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
in the vast majority of instance and we
 
03:55:05.149 --> 03:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
know this based off of what consumers
 
03:55:07.910 --> 03:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
are telling our consumer division these
 
03:55:11.070 --> 03:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
are real people these are real
 
03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
calls what they tell us is we don't
 
03:55:18.510 --> 03:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
understand what this bill is for I have
 
03:55:20.750 --> 03:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
coverage I have health insurance
 
03:55:23.790 --> 03:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
coverage I don't understand why I'm
 
03:55:27.149 --> 03:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
getting this bill when I have coverage
 
03:55:29.710 --> 03:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
and we have to walk them through what's
 
03:55:29.720 --> 03:55:30.469 align:start position:0%
and we have to walk them through what's
going

03:55:30.469 --> 03:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:55:34.149 --> 03:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
on and over time the real life
 
03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
consequence has been and again these are
 
03:55:37.199 --> 03:55:38.510 align:start position:0%
consequence has been and again these are
real

03:55:38.510 --> 03:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
real
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
stories you have individuals who find
 
03:55:44.349 --> 03:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
themselves in some sort of an urgent
 
03:55:44.359 --> 03:55:46.510 align:start position:0%
themselves in some sort of an urgent
medical

03:55:46.510 --> 03:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
medical
 
03:55:49.710 --> 03:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
situation who in the moment they are in
 
03:55:53.309 --> 03:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
that situation have to pause and
 
03:55:56.110 --> 03:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
consider whether or not they want to
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
call 911 to get an ambulance ride to the
 
03:56:02.030 --> 03:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
hospital or whether or not they're going
 
03:56:04.950 --> 03:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
to try to call a family member or wait
 
03:56:07.870 --> 03:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
it out until somebody comes home and
 
03:56:12.070 --> 03:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
finds them to drive them to the hospital
 
03:56:15.510 --> 03:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
because they're not sure they can pay
 
03:56:18.309 --> 03:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
that bill that is
 
03:56:21.670 --> 03:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
real that is the consumer harm that at
 
03:56:25.269 --> 03:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
the end of the day my department is
 
03:56:28.269 --> 03:56:28.279 align:start position:0%
incredibly concerned
 
03:56:28.279 --> 03:56:29.790 align:start position:0%
incredibly concerned
about

03:56:29.790 --> 03:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:56:33.269 --> 03:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
so at this point I want to pause and
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
make one of a handful of points very
 
03:56:37.950 --> 03:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
clear that I will make throughout the
 
03:56:40.149 --> 03:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
course of this
 
03:56:42.429 --> 03:56:42.439 align:start position:0%
presentation if in fact you move forward
 
03:56:44.429 --> 03:56:44.439 align:start position:0%
with this pres with this proposal in a
 
03:56:47.309 --> 03:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
manner that prohibits balance billing it
 
03:56:49.910 --> 03:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
does not mean the provider doesn't get
 
03:56:53.229 --> 03:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
paid in fact it doesn't even necessarily
 
03:56:56.070 --> 03:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
mean that the provider will not get paid
 
03:56:57.550 --> 03:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
over and
 
03:57:00.389 --> 03:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
above what the carrier is willing to pay
 
03:57:02.149 --> 03:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
an out of network
 
03:57:05.309 --> 03:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
provider as you've heard before ground
 
03:57:07.550 --> 03:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
ambulance is the Last Frontier of
 
03:57:09.870 --> 03:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
medical services that does not prohibit
 
03:57:09.880 --> 03:57:10.950 align:start position:0%
medical services that does not prohibit
balance

03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
balance
 
03:57:14.550 --> 03:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
billing but in all of those other areas
 
03:57:16.510 --> 03:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
whether it be with the state level
 
03:57:18.550 --> 03:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
protections or whether it be with the
 
03:57:20.309 --> 03:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
federal protections through the no
 
03:57:22.950 --> 03:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
surprises act there is an independent
 
03:57:26.110 --> 03:57:26.120 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process that can be
 
03:57:29.550 --> 03:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
accessed by either party and that
 
03:57:32.710 --> 03:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
independent resolution process will
 
03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
determine based off of the facts that
 
03:57:36.990 --> 03:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
both parties provide what the
 
03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
commercially reasonable rate should be
 
03:57:42.269 --> 03:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
for that ride again when there is a
 
03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
conflict between the provider and the
 
03:57:47.070 --> 03:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
carrier and the amount that that
 
03:57:49.110 --> 03:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
independent resolution process May
 
03:57:52.149 --> 03:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
produce again may be well over and above
 
03:57:54.630 --> 03:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
whatever that carrier was going to pay
 
03:57:57.309 --> 03:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
that Provider by virtue of them being
 
03:57:59.229 --> 03:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
out of network you can do that here if
 
03:57:59.239 --> 03:58:00.229 align:start position:0%
out of network you can do that here if
you'd

03:58:00.229 --> 03:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
you'd
 
03:58:05.910 --> 03:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
want so again fundamentally what we are
 
03:58:08.149 --> 03:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
seeking to do and what we have advocated
 
03:58:11.790 --> 03:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
for over many number of years is to
 
03:58:16.429 --> 03:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
remove the consumer from the dispute
 
03:58:19.229 --> 03:58:19.239 align:start position:0%
between the provider and the
 
03:58:21.550 --> 03:58:21.560 align:start position:0%
carrier that's what the state level
 
03:58:23.910 --> 03:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
balance billing prohibition does that's
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
what the no surprises act does that
 
03:58:28.189 --> 03:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
fundamentally is what we are trying to
 
03:58:31.269 --> 03:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
do here we fundamentally believe that it
 
03:58:34.830 --> 03:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
is unfair to stick a consumer in the
 
03:58:37.750 --> 03:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
middle of this dispute and give them a
 
03:58:40.910 --> 03:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill that they didn't know was coming
 
03:58:44.269 --> 03:58:44.279 align:start position:0%
don't understand and for many of them
 
03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
they can't
 
03:58:49.309 --> 03:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
afford so that has been the principle by
 
03:58:51.389 --> 03:58:51.399 align:start position:0%
which my department has engaged on this
 
03:58:54.870 --> 03:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
issue in the past let's flash forward to
 
03:58:56.389 --> 03:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
the summer of
 
03:58:58.670 --> 03:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
2023 I just become
 
03:59:00.630 --> 03:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner I began reading in the
 
03:59:00.640 --> 03:59:01.830 align:start position:0%
commissioner I began reading in the
newspaper

03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
newspaper
 
03:59:04.830 --> 03:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
stories about ambulance providers who
 
03:59:06.830 --> 03:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
were under
 
03:59:10.590 --> 03:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
significant and very real financial
 
03:59:13.670 --> 03:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
distress and I read those stories and I
 
03:59:16.349 --> 03:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
want to be very very clear I have
 
03:59:19.309 --> 03:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
nothing but the utmost respect and
 
03:59:22.389 --> 03:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
admiration for the work that our ground
 
03:59:25.110 --> 03:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers provide they have
 
03:59:27.309 --> 03:59:27.319 align:start position:0%
saved my father's life they have
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
transported my children and I've got two
 
03:59:32.950 --> 03:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
boys ages four and seven as boys that
 
03:59:34.710 --> 03:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
age or want to do they sometimes do
 
03:59:36.630 --> 03:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
stupid things they bump the head they
 
03:59:39.630 --> 03:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
got to go to the ambulance I have great
 
03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
respect and admiration for what they do
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
I would never report to understand the
 
03:59:47.830 --> 03:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
full totality of the challenges they
 
03:59:50.750 --> 03:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
face but I do understand the obligation
 
03:59:52.910 --> 03:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
that they're under to maintain a
 
03:59:55.469 --> 03:59:55.479 align:start position:0%
constant state of Readiness whether or
 
03:59:57.750 --> 03:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
not as representative hunt mentioned
 
04:00:00.269 --> 04:00:00.279 align:start position:0%
they get a thousand calls in a week or
 
04:00:02.149 --> 04:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
they get zero calls in a week they've
 
04:00:05.910 --> 04:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
got to be ready under all circumstances
 
04:00:09.269 --> 04:00:09.279 align:start position:0%
I understand that and I get
 
04:00:11.790 --> 04:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
that but I was reading these stories of
 
04:00:14.750 --> 04:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
the financial troubles they were having
 
04:00:17.149 --> 04:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
I paired that with the position the
 
04:00:18.790 --> 04:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
department had taken with respect to
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
balance billing and I thought to myself
 
04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
maybe the Stars the Moon and the Sun
 
04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
have aligned in such a way that we can
 
04:00:30.389 --> 04:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
bring all of the parties together put
 
04:00:32.830 --> 04:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
the best ideas on the table and
 
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
potentially bring a resolution forward
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
that does right by the providers that
 
04:00:40.030 --> 04:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
does right by the communities that does
 
04:00:42.990 --> 04:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
right by the consumer and so out of that
 
04:00:46.189 --> 04:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
came the ambulance Summit as I nicknamed
 
04:00:49.590 --> 04:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
it it was a series of meetings that my
 
04:00:52.309 --> 04:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
department hosted we brought together a
 
04:00:54.510 --> 04:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
wide array of stakeholders we obviously
 
04:00:57.189 --> 04:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
had officials from the Department we had
 
04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
providers there at the table both
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
commercial and Municipal providers we
 
04:01:04.149 --> 04:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
had all of the carriers at the
 
04:01:07.630 --> 04:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
table we formed subgroups to look at the
 
04:01:09.910 --> 04:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
different aspects of this
 
04:01:12.269 --> 04:01:12.279 align:start position:0%
problem whether it was the reimbursement
 
04:01:14.149 --> 04:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
rates whether it was the challenges that
 
04:01:17.070 --> 04:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
the providers were having with transport
 
04:01:19.349 --> 04:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
to uh from from one facility to another
 
04:01:21.030 --> 04:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
facility to facility
 
04:01:23.990 --> 04:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
transports and also considering what
 
04:01:27.910 --> 04:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
reforms the providers needed to consider
 
04:01:31.630 --> 04:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
in their business model to ensure that
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
they were financially sustainable and
 
04:01:37.550 --> 04:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
stable going forward and it was out of
 
04:01:39.750 --> 04:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
that ambulance Summit that we came to
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that here in New
 
04:01:45.269 --> 04:01:45.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the ride mix
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
is Approximately
 
04:01:49.630 --> 04:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
80% of the
 
04:01:52.429 --> 04:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
rides are from one of the two government
 
04:01:55.229 --> 04:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
programs Medicare
 
04:01:57.550 --> 04:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and as you
 
04:02:00.229 --> 04:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
know the trouble with those two programs
 
04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
is those reimbursement rates are
 
04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
fixed Medicare rates are fixed entirely
 
04:02:09.950 --> 04:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
by the federal government we can
 
04:02:12.309 --> 04:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
certainly Lobby them representative
 
04:02:14.630 --> 04:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
spear we can certainly explain to them
 
04:02:17.229 --> 04:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
what we're doing the situation that we
 
04:02:19.030 --> 04:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
Face here in New Hampshire and encourage
 
04:02:21.309 --> 04:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
them to consider rate increases for
 
04:02:22.510 --> 04:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare this being the federal
 
04:02:24.550 --> 04:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
government and I would first start by
 
04:02:26.870 --> 04:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
engaging the federal delegation who I
 
04:02:28.510 --> 04:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
think understand this problem very well
 
04:02:30.469 --> 04:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
and Could Be an Effective advocate for
 
04:02:32.870 --> 04:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
us but you've also got
 
04:02:35.229 --> 04:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid again
 
04:02:37.550 --> 04:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
set foundationally by the federal
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
government the state does have a role in
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
that you in fact increased at the state
 
04:02:44.269 --> 04:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
level the reimbursement rates for ground
 
04:02:46.990 --> 04:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
ambulance in the last budget my
 
04:02:48.670 --> 04:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is that was helpful
 
04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
clearly there's more to be
 
04:02:50.880 --> 04:02:52.550 align:start position:0%
clearly there's more to be
done

04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:02:55.389 --> 04:02:55.399 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the financial crisis as I
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
understand it that the providers are
 
04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
facing is there is a Delta between what
 
04:03:04.429 --> 04:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
they are able to get in
 
04:03:07.790 --> 04:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursements from those 80% of rides
 
04:03:09.510 --> 04:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
from Medicare and
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and what they need to sustain
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
and my fear
 
04:03:20.429 --> 04:03:20.439 align:start position:0%
is what is being attempted here under
 
04:03:25.149 --> 04:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
the status quo is to fill that
 
04:03:28.910 --> 04:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
Delta on the backs of the commercial
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
insurance individuals those who are
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
covered by an insurance a commercial
 
04:03:32.720 --> 04:03:34.189 align:start position:0%
covered by an insurance a commercial
insurance

04:03:34.189 --> 04:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:03:36.510 --> 04:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
carrier it seems to me as though what
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
they want what the status quo
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
dictates is that 20% of those rides will
 
04:03:44.790 --> 04:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
fill the
 
04:03:46.910 --> 04:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
delta in the
 
04:03:49.950 --> 04:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
budgets in terms of what the providers
 
04:03:52.670 --> 04:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
are not able to collect from the 80% of
 
04:03:52.680 --> 04:03:54.389 align:start position:0%
are not able to collect from the 80% of
the

04:03:54.389 --> 04:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:03:57.309 --> 04:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
rise as a personal matter I don't know
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
that that's fair I don't think that's
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
fair however as a policy
 
04:04:06.590 --> 04:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
matter if you do
 
04:04:09.630 --> 04:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
this if you say we're going to set the
 
04:04:14.149 --> 04:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
rate at whatever amount it takes to fill
 
04:04:14.159 --> 04:04:15.550 align:start position:0%
rate at whatever amount it takes to fill
that

04:04:15.550 --> 04:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:17.870 --> 04:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
Delta there is no
 
04:04:20.429 --> 04:04:20.439 align:start position:0%
question that you will see an increase
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
in commercial insurance premiums that's
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
a policy decision for you to
 
04:04:28.429 --> 04:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
make but the consequence of that will be
 
04:04:28.439 --> 04:04:29.429 align:start position:0%
make but the consequence of that will be
higher

04:04:29.429 --> 04:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:04:32.229 --> 04:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
premiums and we talk a lot in this
 
04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
committee and over in the Senate and
 
04:04:37.710 --> 04:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
elsewhere about things that are barriers
 
04:04:40.510 --> 04:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
to access to care for
 
04:04:42.429 --> 04:04:42.439 align:start position:0%
individuals and there are a number of
 
04:04:42.439 --> 04:04:44.149 align:start position:0%
individuals and there are a number of
things

04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
but for me
 
04:04:49.110 --> 04:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the biggest barrier to
 
04:04:52.110 --> 04:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
access to care for residents of this
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
state is
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
cost and you cannot lose sight of
 
04:05:00.309 --> 04:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
that you cannot lose sight of
 
04:05:02.070 --> 04:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
that and
 
04:05:05.630 --> 04:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
so we brought the report forward you
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
have it before you you can take a look
 
04:05:09.630 --> 04:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
at exactly what we looked into you can
 
04:05:10.670 --> 04:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
exactly excuse me the conclusions and
 
04:05:15.750 --> 04:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were brought
 
04:05:18.510 --> 04:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
forward and that report was the basis
 
04:05:21.429 --> 04:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
for the discussion that we and others
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
had with you last year now at that point
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
in time we were not able to reach a
 
04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
consensus as to
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what the appropriate remedy and
 
04:05:34.910 --> 04:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
specifically what the appropriate
 
04:05:37.790 --> 04:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement schedule should
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
be and again we're talking now just
 
04:05:43.149 --> 04:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
about what the appropriate reimbursement
 
04:05:46.429 --> 04:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
schedule should be for commercial
 
04:05:46.439 --> 04:05:48.309 align:start position:0%
schedule should be for commercial
insurance

04:05:48.309 --> 04:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:05:52.990 --> 04:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
carriers as tied to as Tethered to the
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
cost to transport commercially insured
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
individuals and so as a result of the
 
04:06:02.189 --> 04:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
fact that we were not able to come to a
 
04:06:04.030 --> 04:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
consensus on
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the legislature asked us to gave us
 
04:06:07.920 --> 04:06:08.910 align:start position:0%
that the legislature asked us to gave us
a

04:06:08.910 --> 04:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
directive to undertake an analysis an
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
Actuarial analysis
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
to look at the data to look at the
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
numbers and determine what the
 
04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate rate schedule should
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
be we as a department were very clear
 
04:06:26.950 --> 04:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
that level of
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
analysis was not something that we
 
04:06:31.710 --> 04:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
internally would be able to undertake
 
04:06:34.990 --> 04:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
and you know what that was actually very
 
04:06:37.429 --> 04:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
fortuitous because what it forced us to
 
04:06:40.469 --> 04:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
do was to take the entire issue out of
 
04:06:44.830 --> 04:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
our hands and I'll stipulate I'm bias I
 
04:06:47.670 --> 04:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
want to be done and be rid of balance
 
04:06:50.110 --> 04:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
billing so I took it out of my
 
04:06:52.830 --> 04:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
Department's hands and we contracted
 
04:06:55.790 --> 04:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
with an independent third-party
 
04:06:59.229 --> 04:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
Actuarial firm no dog in the
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
hunt to look at the numbers to take in
 
04:07:05.070 --> 04:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
the data to hear from the stakeholders
 
04:07:07.950 --> 04:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
and to put forward what they based on
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
the math determin to be the most
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate reimbursement schedule
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
and they did that and it's important to
 
04:07:19.269 --> 04:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
note a couple of
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
things the and by the way that actual
 
04:07:26.550 --> 04:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
report by PCG is also before you they
 
04:07:29.710 --> 04:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
engaged in a very inclusive process all
 
04:07:31.149 --> 04:07:31.159 align:start position:0%
of the stakeholders were brought to the
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
table they were regular sessions where
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
everybody came together provided input
 
04:07:38.670 --> 04:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
got feedback got updates on where they
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
were in their
 
04:07:42.910 --> 04:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
analysis but fundamentally the numbers
 
04:07:47.309 --> 04:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
that piece CG used in their analysis are
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
the numbers provided to them by the
 
04:07:53.309 --> 04:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
providers themselves they're not my
 
04:07:56.149 --> 04:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
numbers they're not the carriers numbers
 
04:07:58.510 --> 04:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
they're the numbers that the providers
 
04:08:02.349 --> 04:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
gave to them to Crunch and analyze and
 
04:08:06.070 --> 04:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
that is what is reflected in the report
 
04:08:09.630 --> 04:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
and those are the concepts that you see
 
04:08:13.030 --> 04:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
reflected in The Proposal before you a
 
04:08:13.040 --> 04:08:14.469 align:start position:0%
reflected in The Proposal before you a
few

04:08:14.469 --> 04:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
few
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
points PCG the individuals as I
 
04:08:20.189 --> 04:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
affectionately call them the math
 
04:08:23.630 --> 04:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
nerds will be available to you what
 
04:08:25.389 --> 04:08:25.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to do my understanding is
 
04:08:27.389 --> 04:08:27.399 align:start position:0%
that representative Hunt is going to
 
04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
consolidate the three propos proposals
 
04:08:31.389 --> 04:08:31.399 align:start position:0%
coming before this committee pertaining
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
to this issue into one
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
subgroup whenever that subgroup is
 
04:08:38.670 --> 04:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
scheduled to meet the folks from PCG
 
04:08:41.229 --> 04:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
will fly here to New Hampshire they will
 
04:08:44.910 --> 04:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
go as deep and as thorough and as wide
 
04:08:46.910 --> 04:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
on their analysis as you would like them
 
04:08:48.910 --> 04:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
to go and you can ask them any question
 
04:08:50.349 --> 04:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
that you would like as to how they
 
04:08:53.189 --> 04:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
arrived at the conclusions that they did
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
certainly Alex and I and Dr AES will do
 
04:08:57.149 --> 04:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
our best as well should you have
 
04:08:57.159 --> 04:08:58.469 align:start position:0%
our best as well should you have
questions

04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:09:01.229 --> 04:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
today but those individuals will be
 
04:09:06.030 --> 04:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.389 --> 04:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
scheduled so as I've said the data
 
04:09:10.990 --> 04:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
before you is the data that was provided
 
04:09:14.469 --> 04:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
to them by the provid ERS so they'll get
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
into that as
 
04:09:19.349 --> 04:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
well I want to also be clear this
 
04:09:22.590 --> 04:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
legislation does not
 
04:09:26.349 --> 04:09:26.359 align:start position:0%
dictate that providers and carriers must
 
04:09:29.109 --> 04:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
get into contract this is still the
 
04:09:31.510 --> 04:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
United States of America government
 
04:09:33.710 --> 04:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
cannot force two private parties to
 
04:09:36.189 --> 04:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
enter into an agreement enter into a
 
04:09:38.670 --> 04:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
contract if they don't want to if they
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
can't come to mutually agreeable
 
04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
terms what we do hope the proposal will
 
04:09:47.189 --> 04:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
do is to provide an incentive and to
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
provide a basis a
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
foundation for those two parties to be
 
04:09:55.870 --> 04:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
able to have more fruitful
 
04:09:58.510 --> 04:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
negotiations to be able to come into
 
04:10:01.590 --> 04:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
Network and there are a lot of
 
04:10:04.830 --> 04:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
advantages to them coming into Network
 
04:10:07.950 --> 04:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
there is certainty for the provider as
 
04:10:10.109 --> 04:10:10.119 align:start position:0%
to what they're going to get from the
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
carrier hopefully the negotiations
 
04:10:15.149 --> 04:10:15.159 align:start position:0%
become far less was contentious and
 
04:10:17.149 --> 04:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
again because of the prohibition on
 
04:10:19.109 --> 04:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
balance billing the consumer is removed
 
04:10:19.119 --> 04:10:20.389 align:start position:0%
balance billing the consumer is removed
from

04:10:20.389 --> 04:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:10:24.269 --> 04:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
it so that is that is the hope that is
 
04:10:26.790 --> 04:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
certainly our hope that is the goal of
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.349 --> 04:10:36.359 align:start position:0%
here I'm going to be candid with
 
04:10:39.750 --> 04:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
you I've been at this for a long
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
time I think that what is before you is
 
04:10:47.309 --> 04:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
the most viable solution to a very very
 
04:10:50.550 --> 04:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
difficult problem not the perfect
 
04:10:52.389 --> 04:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
solution and I know that you're going to
 
04:10:54.510 --> 04:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
hear from a number of providers who are
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
going to tell you that the rates that
 
04:10:59.870 --> 04:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
are reflected here are
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
insufficient I understand
 
04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
that one of the key questions I think
 
04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
consider when some of these providers
 
04:11:10.990 --> 04:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
tell you that they charge well over and
 
04:11:13.830 --> 04:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
above the rates that are dictated
 
04:11:17.109 --> 04:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
or put forward in this proposal is at
 
04:11:18.070 --> 04:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the day you can charge
 
04:11:19.109 --> 04:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
whatever you
 
04:11:24.630 --> 04:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:26.830 --> 04:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
charge and I would submit to you and
 
04:11:28.510 --> 04:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
again they understand the nuances and
 
04:11:30.309 --> 04:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
the details way better than I and they
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
may have a
 
04:11:36.429 --> 04:11:36.439 align:start position:0%
perfectly great answer to this that puts
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
to rest my confusion on
 
04:11:42.550 --> 04:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
this but I have to believe that if they
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
had a high degree of success in
 
04:11:48.910 --> 04:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
collecting whatever it is they
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
charge they would not be under the
 
04:11:52.990 --> 04:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
financial pressure that they're in
 
04:11:55.389 --> 04:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
there's a problem there I don't know
 
04:11:58.510 --> 04:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is I suspect a lot of it
 
04:12:02.229 --> 04:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
has to do with the fact they can build
 
04:12:04.630 --> 04:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
consumers and balance build them but at
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
the end of the day if the consumer
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
cannot afford
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
it and the consumer doesn't care about
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
their credit score they just won't pay
 
04:12:12.479 --> 04:12:14.389 align:start position:0%
their credit score they just won't pay
it

04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
04:12:18.389 --> 04:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
out like I said I don't know that that's
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
the totality of the problem but I know
 
04:12:22.990 --> 04:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's a part of the
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
problem so as I've said I think what
 
04:12:27.309 --> 04:12:27.319 align:start position:0%
you've got here is a viable solution
 
04:12:30.229 --> 04:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
based off of math based off of a fair
 
04:12:32.189 --> 04:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
and impartial
 
04:12:35.070 --> 04:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
analysis and it's worthy of your
 
04:12:36.870 --> 04:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
consideration and the last thing I'll
 
04:12:40.030 --> 04:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
say is you've kind of
 
04:12:43.550 --> 04:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
got a limited number of options and this
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
is a policy decision for you to make so
 
04:12:48.349 --> 04:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put forward to you what I
 
04:12:50.750 --> 04:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
think your options are and then you
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
decide which of these is most palatable
 
04:12:53.199 --> 04:12:53.870 align:start position:0%
decide which of these is most palatable
to

04:12:53.870 --> 04:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:12:57.189 --> 04:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
you you could continue the status
 
04:13:00.149 --> 04:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
quo but my understanding if what I have
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
been told is true and there's absolutely
 
04:13:03.990 --> 04:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
no reason to believe that what I have
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
been told is not true if you continue
 
04:13:10.830 --> 04:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
the status quo you will continue to have
 
04:13:15.030 --> 04:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
providers who are in financial distress
 
04:13:18.269 --> 04:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
if they are commercial private ambulance
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
providers with no back
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
stop they could potentially go out of
 
04:13:22.960 --> 04:13:24.550 align:start position:0%
stop they could potentially go out of
business

04:13:24.550 --> 04:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:13:26.910 --> 04:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
altogether if they're a municipal
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
provider there's a little bit of a back
 
04:13:30.750 --> 04:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
stop there they can dip into their
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
underlying fire department budget or
 
04:13:34.830 --> 04:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
they could pass the cost off to the
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer not a great solution
 
04:13:39.229 --> 04:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
not one that they're happy with not one
 
04:13:40.710 --> 04:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy with probably not one
 
04:13:42.510 --> 04:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
that you're happy with either we're all
 
04:13:46.630 --> 04:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:49.229 --> 04:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
state point being is that not all of the
 
04:13:51.910 --> 04:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
providers are exactly the same
 
04:13:54.349 --> 04:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
posture and we of course can continue to
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
balance Bill consumers and hurt
 
04:13:59.229 --> 04:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
consumers that's the status
 
04:14:02.510 --> 04:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
quo you can move forward with this
 
04:14:06.510 --> 04:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
proposal which to me based off of my
 
04:14:10.030 --> 04:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
read is the perfect definition of a
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
compromise in the sense that the
 
04:14:15.870 --> 04:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
providers aren't happy the carriers are
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
here I don't know that they're going to
 
04:14:19.389 --> 04:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
say anything but let me tell you based
 
04:14:21.109 --> 04:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
on the conversations that I've had they
 
04:14:22.590 --> 04:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
aren't happy because they're having to
 
04:14:25.550 --> 04:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
pay more they're having to pay more
 
04:14:28.149 --> 04:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
particularly for those rides that are in
 
04:14:31.149 --> 04:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
Rural and super rural areas of our state
 
04:14:33.510 --> 04:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
where the rides are less frequent but
 
04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
the distances are longer so they're not
 
04:14:40.830 --> 04:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
happy and I guess the only person I
 
04:14:42.429 --> 04:14:42.439 align:start position:0%
guess who's kind of sort of happy is me
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
because I and maybe you because you get
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
to put this issue to rest but again when
 
04:14:48.670 --> 04:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the two parties
 
04:14:50.670 --> 04:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
that have been most in conflict with
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
each other over the course of this issue
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
over those 25 30 years are the carriers
 
04:14:58.109 --> 04:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:15:00.870 --> 04:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
providers but at least under this
 
04:15:02.990 --> 04:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
proposal you have the
 
04:15:05.710 --> 04:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
basis for those providers to begin
 
04:15:09.389 --> 04:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
bringing in more financial support and
 
04:15:11.469 --> 04:15:11.479 align:start position:0%
at least back some of them away from the
 
04:15:13.710 --> 04:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
financial cliff that we're told that
 
04:15:13.720 --> 04:15:14.590 align:start position:0%
financial cliff that we're told that
they're

04:15:14.590 --> 04:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:15:18.750 --> 04:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
facing the third option is you can set
 
04:15:18.760 --> 04:15:20.269 align:start position:0%
facing the third option is you can set
the

04:15:20.269 --> 04:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:22.950 --> 04:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
rate however you want you want to go
 
04:15:27.630 --> 04:15:27.640 align:start position:0%
300% 400% over an aade you can do
 
04:15:30.030 --> 04:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
that again you can't force them into
 
04:15:31.870 --> 04:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
contract but you can set the
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
rate way up
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
there understanding that if that is in
 
04:15:38.910 --> 04:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
fact what plays out you're going to see
 
04:15:41.349 --> 04:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
increase in premiums it's going to be
 
04:15:43.389 --> 04:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
more difficult for individuals to afford
 
04:15:47.790 --> 04:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
those premiums and while it is never
 
04:15:49.429 --> 04:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
something that I would recommend there
 
04:15:50.950 --> 04:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
are a portion of those individuals who
 
04:15:55.870 --> 04:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:59.070 --> 04:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
all I wish I had something a fourth
 
04:16:01.070 --> 04:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
option that brought everybody together
 
04:16:01.080 --> 04:16:01.830 align:start position:0%
option that brought everybody together
in

04:16:01.830 --> 04:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:16:03.870 --> 04:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
celebration I don't have
 
04:16:06.229 --> 04:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
it and my commitment to you is to always
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
be honest and so as I survey this
 
04:16:12.269 --> 04:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
situation as I survey the landscape of
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
what's before you you those are the
 
04:16:17.109 --> 04:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
three options that you have to consider
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a policy decision for you to
 
04:16:22.469 --> 04:16:22.479 align:start position:0%
make so at this point I'll turn to Alex
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
is there anything there that I have
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
missed that you feel is important for
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
the committee to uh be aware of no um
 
04:16:32.670 --> 04:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
you've done a great job of um describing
 
04:16:35.710 --> 04:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
the landscape and overall policy
 
04:16:40.109 --> 04:16:40.119 align:start position:0%
considerations but um what I would like
 
04:16:43.950 --> 04:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
to do would be to go over um
 
04:16:45.670 --> 04:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
in just the right amount of detail
 
04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
what's actually in the bill so that we
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
can have a good common understanding of
 
04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
what the bill does and uh I've put most
 
04:17:06.070 --> 04:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
writing so um as briefly as possible
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
then um this bill uh does three
 
04:17:17.070 --> 04:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
things uh in essence it requires the
 
04:17:18.990 --> 04:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
establishment through insurance
 
04:17:22.510 --> 04:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
department rul making of a cost-based
 
04:17:25.910 --> 04:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
annually updated rate schedule that
 
04:17:28.109 --> 04:17:28.119 align:start position:0%
commercial payers will be required to
 
04:17:31.070 --> 04:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
use in reimbursing ground ambulance
 
04:17:34.750 --> 04:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
providers who not are not in network
 
04:17:36.990 --> 04:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
that's number one sort of a mandatory
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
schedule if you don't have a contract
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
this is the rate that you will reimburse
 
04:17:45.990 --> 04:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
at number two it prohibits ground
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers from balance
 
04:17:52.510 --> 04:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
billing and number three it establishes
 
04:17:55.149 --> 04:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
a commission on all pair model program
 
04:17:58.189 --> 04:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
for ground ambulance services that will
 
04:18:01.349 --> 04:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
examine the feasibility of applying for
 
04:18:04.750 --> 04:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
a federal waiver under section 1115a of
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
the Social Security Act to enter into an
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
allpay model agreement for reimbursement
 
04:18:12.429 --> 04:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
of ground ambulance services in the
 
04:18:12.439 --> 04:18:13.710 align:start position:0%
of ground ambulance services in the
state

04:18:13.710 --> 04:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:18:16.590 --> 04:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
the alpair model agreement would do um
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
you you've heard some mention of it
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
already it would create a common
 
04:18:25.149 --> 04:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
reimbursement schedule for Medicare
 
04:18:27.469 --> 04:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and Commercial payers it's
 
04:18:29.229 --> 04:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
something that exists in a number of
 
04:18:29.239 --> 04:18:30.349 align:start position:0%
something that exists in a number of
other

04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:18:33.990 --> 04:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
states um Maryland is is one
 
04:18:38.910 --> 04:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
example um it requires a waiver and you
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
have to meet Federal standards it would
 
04:18:45.429 --> 04:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
mean uh in this case Medicare raising
 
04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
their rates um as well as Medicare to
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
come up to this uniform rate
 
04:18:53.950 --> 04:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
schedule and you have to show that
 
04:18:56.229 --> 04:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
overall you're going to uh change your
 
04:18:59.910 --> 04:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
system in such a way that it will be
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
cost neutral to the federal government
 
04:19:04.389 --> 04:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
so that's why there's a question about
 
04:19:08.429 --> 04:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of doing it but um it
 
04:19:11.389 --> 04:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
would be such a beautiful solution to
 
04:19:14.910 --> 04:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
this problem that it's worth worth um
 
04:19:17.109 --> 04:19:17.119 align:start position:0%
analyzing the feasibility of doing it
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
and that's what this commission is set
 
04:19:21.389 --> 04:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
up to do as well as to make
 
04:19:23.349 --> 04:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations for reform in the
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
financing and delivery system for ground
 
04:19:26.040 --> 04:19:27.870 align:start position:0%
financing and delivery system for ground
ambulance

04:19:27.870 --> 04:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
04:19:31.710 --> 04:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
services um the fee schedule uh this
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is a result of last year's
 
04:19:36.030 --> 04:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
legislation Senate Bill
 
04:19:38.670 --> 04:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
407 um which required the insurance
 
04:19:42.109 --> 04:19:42.119 align:start position:0%
department to commission the cost study
 
04:19:45.750 --> 04:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and as the commissioner um mentioned
 
04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
we um we put out an RFP we got good
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
responses uh we got four good bids and
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
we selected PCG because of their
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
experience advising ground ambulance
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
providers across the country on how to
 
04:20:04.790 --> 04:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
fill out the Medicare ground ambulance
 
04:20:08.229 --> 04:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
cost survey that has been uh in place
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
the last few years so there's this study
 
04:20:12.910 --> 04:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
that Medicare is undertaking and
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
developed a an a very good tool for
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
determining the costs of ground
 
04:20:23.149 --> 04:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
ambulance services and PCG was familiar
 
04:20:23.159 --> 04:20:24.109 align:start position:0%
ambulance services and PCG was familiar
with

04:20:24.109 --> 04:20:24.119 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:20:27.790 --> 04:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
that um the
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill
 
04:20:33.510 --> 04:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
407 put a number of requirements on how
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
we do this cost study and how our vendor
 
04:20:40.429 --> 04:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
who we hire does a cost study it has to
 
04:20:42.349 --> 04:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
be evidence-based so it has to be on
 
04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
real real information provided by
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
ambulance ground ambulance providers
 
04:20:48.389 --> 04:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
about their
 
04:20:50.990 --> 04:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
costs it the fee schedule they come up
 
04:20:52.870 --> 04:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
with could be a percenter Medicare or
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
could be independently developed
 
04:20:58.950 --> 04:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
schedule um the reimbursement must be
 
04:21:01.630 --> 04:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
designed to cover their cost now this is
 
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
something that came out of the ambulance
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
Summit that we heard frequently is all
 
04:21:10.389 --> 04:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
we want is our cost to be covered
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
because the debate would come up with
 
04:21:15.550 --> 04:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
you know what ground ambulance providers
 
04:21:18.389 --> 04:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
really want is to cost shift uh from
 
04:21:21.070 --> 04:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid onto commercial and
 
04:21:24.109 --> 04:21:24.119 align:start position:0%
frequently the answer we heard is no we
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
just want our costs covered so the whole
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
idea of Center Bill 407 is let's look at
 
04:21:31.040 --> 04:21:32.670 align:start position:0%
idea of Center Bill 407 is let's look at
scientifically

04:21:32.670 --> 04:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
scientifically
 
04:21:34.990 --> 04:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
evidence-based what a fee schedule would
 
04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
look like that does cover
 
04:21:43.149 --> 04:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:45.229 --> 04:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
the one of the assumptions that was
 
04:21:47.670 --> 04:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
required to be made in 407 is also that
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
we hold constant the current level of
 
04:21:54.149 --> 04:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
funding for ground ambulance that comes
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
from the local property taxes so in
 
04:21:58.710 --> 04:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
other words we're not going to try to
 
04:22:00.870 --> 04:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
replace property taxes with this
 
04:22:02.309 --> 04:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement schedule we're going to
 
04:22:05.710 --> 04:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
assume that that's just held
 
04:22:05.720 --> 04:22:07.590 align:start position:0%
assume that that's just held
constant

04:22:07.590 --> 04:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
constant
 
04:22:11.109 --> 04:22:11.119 align:start position:0%
um and we're going to uh require that
 
04:22:13.910 --> 04:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
the fee schedule allow for a reasonable
 
04:22:16.790 --> 04:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
operating margin for ground ambulance
 
04:22:20.269 --> 04:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
providers in support of what um is
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
called Readiness you know uh the ability
 
04:22:27.510 --> 04:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
to adapt to increases in demand and to
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
still be able to fulfill uh the services
 
04:22:32.710 --> 04:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:22:35.429 --> 04:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
required um and the cost estimates must
 
04:22:38.109 --> 04:22:38.119 align:start position:0%
assume services will be provided in a
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
reasonably cost effective
 
04:22:43.790 --> 04:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
manner okay so those were are the
 
04:22:47.109 --> 04:22:47.119 align:start position:0%
injunctions given to PCG in terms of
 
04:22:49.790 --> 04:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
coming up with a fee
 
04:22:54.990 --> 04:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
schedule um and
 
04:22:55.000 --> 04:22:56.630 align:start position:0%
schedule um and
um

04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:59.670 --> 04:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire insurance
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
department worked with the New Hampshire
 
04:23:04.830 --> 04:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
Health Plan and with the Department of
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
Safety to uh manage the performance of
 
04:23:12.670 --> 04:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
this project by PCG so we had a work
 
04:23:15.990 --> 04:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
team a core team that met every week
 
04:23:19.670 --> 04:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
over the summer and the fall it was
 
04:23:23.229 --> 04:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
fun was we were under a lot of pressure
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
um to to get things
 
04:23:26.960 --> 04:23:28.990 align:start position:0%
um to to get things
done

04:23:28.990 --> 04:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:23:36.990 --> 04:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
um process that PCG used was to leverage
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that there are these existing
 
04:23:42.910 --> 04:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
cost surveys that many of the ground
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers in the state have
 
04:23:48.109 --> 04:23:48.119 align:start position:0%
already completed under that Medicare

ground ambulance data collection system
 
04:23:51.279 --> 04:23:52.990 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance data collection system
called

04:23:52.990 --> 04:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
called
 
04:23:55.590 --> 04:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
gats uh at least that's how we all
 
04:24:00.429 --> 04:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
pronounced it um and uh it's a
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
well-designed survey it's survey that's
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
audited and many of the providers are
 
04:24:08.830 --> 04:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
already completed it so we were able to
 
04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
leverage those surveys to come up with
 
04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
sample of uh ground ambulance providers
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
in the state that did a good job of
 
04:24:21.790 --> 04:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
representing the ground ambulance
 
04:24:24.429 --> 04:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
providers as a whole in the state we cut
 
04:24:26.429 --> 04:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
it up by different categories for
 
04:24:29.870 --> 04:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
example Fire based not Fire
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
based Urban rural Hospital based not
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
Hospital based and in each case from our
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
sample we had good representation of the
 
04:24:43.229 --> 04:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
different segments of ground
 
04:24:46.830 --> 04:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
providers uh so we felt PCG felt that in
 
04:24:48.870 --> 04:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
the end they had good
 
04:24:52.750 --> 04:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
representation um in their um sample
 
04:24:55.389 --> 04:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
that they were using for their analysis
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
and then they basically
 
04:25:02.070 --> 04:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
um using the cost information developed
 
04:25:02.080 --> 04:25:02.990 align:start position:0%
um using the cost information developed
an

04:25:02.990 --> 04:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
overall uh cost per unit of
 
04:25:11.149 --> 04:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
service uh they broke it down into
 
04:25:13.790 --> 04:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
transport uh
 
04:25:15.229 --> 04:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
treat no
 
04:25:18.550 --> 04:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
transport and mileage so they broke it
 
04:25:21.349 --> 04:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
out down into those three pieces and
 
04:25:25.109 --> 04:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
developed and discern the average cost
 
04:25:28.149 --> 04:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
Statewide for those three pieces of
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
service and then they built the rate
 
04:25:33.910 --> 04:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
schedule the Medicare rate schedule I
 
04:25:37.510 --> 04:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
mean the the rate schedule that's
 
04:25:40.429 --> 04:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
intended to be cost based using a
 
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare methodology
 
04:25:46.109 --> 04:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
of once you have a base rate then you
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
apply relative value conversion factor
 
04:25:51.389 --> 04:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
that represents the intensity of the
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
service so there are some procedure
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
codes that are more intensive in terms
 
04:26:00.030 --> 04:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
of the level of care providers others
 
04:26:04.510 --> 04:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
less um so PCG used the
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
Medicare rvus relative value units to
 
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
make those adjustments and then they use
 
04:26:12.349 --> 04:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
the Medicare adjustments for urban rural
 
04:26:15.630 --> 04:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
super rural because it provided an extra
 
04:26:18.510 --> 04:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
boost especially for super rural which
 
04:26:24.870 --> 04:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
is essentially all of Coos County um uh
 
04:26:27.630 --> 04:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
they made a couple other assumptions
 
04:26:31.469 --> 04:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
that were beneficial to the providers in
 
04:26:36.309 --> 04:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
terms of um treat no transport Medicare
 
04:26:39.030 --> 04:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't reimburse at all for
 
04:26:42.910 --> 04:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
that uh PCC determined that in a cost
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
based system it made sense that there
 
04:26:46.910 --> 04:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
would be reimbursement and so they had
 
04:26:49.469 --> 04:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
to do a separate calculation of the cost
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
of providing that service and they
 
04:26:53.790 --> 04:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
included that in the rid schedule and
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
then they also basically ignored
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
the component of volunteer work there is
 
04:27:03.910 --> 04:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of volunteer support for ground
 
04:27:07.030 --> 04:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
amulance services in the state but they
 
04:27:08.429 --> 04:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
basically made the assumption that those
 
04:27:11.070 --> 04:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
volunteers were getting paid because we
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't know in the future what level of
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer effort there will be so they
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
just added that into the cost
 
04:27:23.630 --> 04:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
basis and then um having done that they
 
04:27:27.630 --> 04:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
applied an additional factor which is an
 
04:27:27.640 --> 04:27:29.229 align:start position:0%
applied an additional factor which is an
Actuarial

04:27:29.229 --> 04:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
Actuarial
 
04:27:29.239 --> 04:27:30.750 align:start position:0%
Actuarial
technique

04:27:30.750 --> 04:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
technique
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
um is called provision for adverse
 
04:27:38.510 --> 04:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
deviation I like that word we all need
 
04:27:42.670 --> 04:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
that in our lives um and it means
 
04:27:45.550 --> 04:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
we may have been wrong circumstances may
 
04:27:49.149 --> 04:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
be different than we you know determined
 
04:27:52.590 --> 04:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
through our analysis so they added uh
 
04:27:56.309 --> 04:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
20% to the rate schedule as a provision
 
04:27:58.149 --> 04:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
for adverse
 
04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
deviation um and that's how they came
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
out with the rate schedule that they did
 
04:28:04.319 --> 04:28:05.469 align:start position:0%
out with the rate schedule that they did
it

04:28:05.469 --> 04:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:28:08.910 --> 04:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
represents 100% increase from what
 
04:28:11.790 --> 04:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
commercial payers are paying today so
 
04:28:11.800 --> 04:28:13.389 align:start position:0%
commercial payers are paying today so
it's

04:28:13.389 --> 04:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:28:16.149 --> 04:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
doubling what commercial payers would be
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
required to
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
pay from what they're paying
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
today it represents about 200 something
 
04:28:28.990 --> 04:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
in excess of 200% of the Medicare rate
 
04:28:31.510 --> 04:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
so in other words commercial payers we
 
04:28:33.590 --> 04:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
looked at the claims data they're
 
04:28:37.349 --> 04:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
currently paying right at or near
 
04:28:37.359 --> 04:28:38.590 align:start position:0%
currently paying right at or near
Medicare

04:28:38.590 --> 04:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
04:28:42.750 --> 04:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
rates so overall the concept is
 
04:28:44.670 --> 04:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
there's kind of a deal going on here
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to double the rates the
 
04:28:49.670 --> 04:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
commercial payers pay and in exchange
 
04:28:51.510 --> 04:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to get rid of balance
 
04:28:54.510 --> 04:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
billing and in addition we're going to
 
04:28:58.269 --> 04:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
form this commission to see about
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
possibly bringing in Medicare and
 
04:29:08.189 --> 04:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid into this uh overall Fe
 
04:29:14.229 --> 04:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:16.990 --> 04:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Commissioners you're welcome
 
04:29:20.469 --> 04:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh before I open this for questions
 
04:29:24.349 --> 04:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
remember they are going to a super
 
04:29:27.109 --> 04:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so try to keep your
 
04:29:30.990 --> 04:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
questions on point and short thank
 
04:29:31.000 --> 04:29:35.710 align:start position:0%
questions on point and short thank
you

04:29:35.710 --> 04:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.910 --> 04:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
yes so I watched the whole process it
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
was pretty
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
impressive uh
 
04:29:44.830 --> 04:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
so if we separate out Medicare for a
 
04:29:47.790 --> 04:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
second because that's still a to-do list
 
04:29:49.870 --> 04:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
kind of a thing if we just look at the
 
04:29:52.070 --> 04:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
commercial carrier kind of component of
 
04:29:54.109 --> 04:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
this thing have you ever gone back to
 
04:29:56.309 --> 04:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
the uh because the all of the input of
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
everything came from the
 
04:30:01.269 --> 04:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
providers that the data that you worked
 
04:30:03.870 --> 04:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
with so have you gone back to those
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
providers and said well what do you
 
04:30:07.109 --> 04:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
think of
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
this you know get a take on it say um
 
04:30:15.630 --> 04:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
we did have we
 
04:30:20.030 --> 04:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
um two advisory groups or um I can't
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
remember I remember the acronyms are seg
 
04:30:29.429 --> 04:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
and sag um and there one uh group was
 
04:30:31.710 --> 04:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
mainly for us to keep everyone up to
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
date on the progress of the analysis and
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
then the SAG was actual Advisory Group
 
04:30:40.389 --> 04:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
where we were asking uh that smaller
 
04:30:43.630 --> 04:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
group uh that we thought were more
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative of you know opinion of
 
04:30:50.510 --> 04:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
providers to give us feedback on on the
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:58.189 --> 04:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
analysis was that feedback I hate it or
 
04:30:59.710 --> 04:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
was that feedback
 
04:31:04.510 --> 04:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
okay um I don't know the the
 
04:31:06.990 --> 04:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
feedback broadly speaking was always a
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
bit contingent upon what at the end of
 
04:31:12.070 --> 04:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
the day the rates were going to be
 
04:31:14.830 --> 04:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
and I will say too that regardless of
 
04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
what comes of
 
04:31:20.070 --> 04:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
this and again this may be Deja Vu for
 
04:31:22.349 --> 04:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
you it's not going to be Deja Vu for me
 
04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
unless you drag me back into it I've
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
done my best here my department has done
 
04:31:29.429 --> 04:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
my best here as I've said I've put
 
04:31:30.870 --> 04:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
before you what I think is the most
 
04:31:33.030 --> 04:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
viable and
 
04:31:36.429 --> 04:31:36.439 align:start position:0%
fair compromise possible I'm not going
 
04:31:36.439 --> 04:31:37.469 align:start position:0%
fair compromise possible I'm not going
to

04:31:37.469 --> 04:31:37.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:31:40.309 --> 04:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
keep being Don kyot tilting at these
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
windmills forever all right but I will
 
04:31:45.269 --> 04:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
say that if nothing else with this
 
04:31:47.550 --> 04:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
process was helpful at least to me and I
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
think to a large degree the carriers as
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
well was providing insight into what the
 
04:31:55.950 --> 04:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
actual costs that the providers have to
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
account for because one of the frequent
 
04:32:00.750 --> 04:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
pieces of feedback that we would get
 
04:32:03.229 --> 04:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
from carriers is they would get these
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
bills for these rides and they wouldn't
 
04:32:09.429 --> 04:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
understand how they arrived at the
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
bottom line number what was provided in
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
the course of that ride sometimes it was
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
fairly obvious it it was a fairly
 
04:32:17.279 --> 04:32:18.870 align:start position:0%
fairly obvious it it was a fairly
intensive

04:32:18.870 --> 04:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
intensive
 
04:32:22.109 --> 04:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
critical Suite of care and services that
 
04:32:23.950 --> 04:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
were needed but in other
 
04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
cases they weren't able to really
 
04:32:27.710 --> 04:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
understand how the dollars added up to
 
04:32:29.469 --> 04:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
get to that bottom line I think that we
 
04:32:32.269 --> 04:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
were able to get a glimpse
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
into what the cost of some of these
 
04:32:37.109 --> 04:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
various component services are for these
 
04:32:40.030 --> 04:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
providers and so in that sense it was
 
04:32:42.990 --> 04:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
very educational
 
04:32:45.070 --> 04:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ammon thank you
 
04:32:48.109 --> 04:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for your testimony uh
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's uh interesting to see this issue
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
resurfaced time and time again question
 
04:32:55.590 --> 04:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
about the the actual rate schedule if if
 
04:32:59.550 --> 04:32:59.560 align:start position:0%
we pass this bill what is the rate
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
schedule um if you pass the bill then
 
04:33:05.949 --> 04:33:05.959 align:start position:0%
the insurance commissioner um is
 
04:33:11.750 --> 04:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
required to promulgate a rule that is um
 
04:33:13.709 --> 04:33:13.719 align:start position:0%
entally equivalent to the rate schedule
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
that you see in the PCG report okay and
 
04:33:20.750 --> 04:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
just a quick followup uh on page two
 
04:33:20.760 --> 04:33:23.590 align:start position:0%
just a quick followup uh on page two
line

04:33:23.590 --> 04:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh it talks about cost
 
04:33:30.429 --> 04:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
sharing line 18 bill yeah in the bill so
 
04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
we we're going to prohibit balance
 
04:33:33.150 --> 04:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
billing but then there's a cost sharing
 
04:33:34.990 --> 04:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
proponent how does that work is that in
 
04:33:36.750 --> 04:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
the rate schedule and does the patient
 
04:33:39.429 --> 04:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
pay that the patient always pays the
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
cost sharing I think the reference to
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
the cost sharing in the bill is just to
 
04:33:46.189 --> 04:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
say uh no balance billing but of course
 
04:33:48.510 --> 04:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
you are still allowed to charge as a
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
provider the cost sharing amount that is
 
04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
in the uh consumer's coverage and so
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
cier is a broad definition for
 
04:33:59.119 --> 04:34:00.750 align:start position:0%
cier is a broad definition for
deductible

04:34:00.750 --> 04:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
deductible
 
04:34:03.789 --> 04:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
co-pay that's what that references so
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
despite the prohibition on balanced
 
04:34:07.029 --> 04:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
billing the consumer is still
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
responsible for whatever the co-pay is
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
under their plan whatever the deductible
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
is under their plan that would not
 
04:34:16.150 --> 04:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
impact that would not be impacted by
 
04:34:16.160 --> 04:34:16.949 align:start position:0%
impact that would not be impacted by
this

04:34:16.949 --> 04:34:16.959 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:26.310 --> 04:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
term thank uh representative
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr shair and thank you
 
04:34:33.390 --> 04:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
both um for a very clear explanation of
 
04:34:37.510 --> 04:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
of how you uh did the work that resulted
 
04:34:40.310 --> 04:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
in this proposal I do have one question
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
which I expect the answer yes but I just
 
04:34:45.990 --> 04:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure
 
04:34:51.189 --> 04:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
um does the PCG proposed rate schedule
 
04:34:54.629 --> 04:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
factor in the costs of the ambulance
 
04:34:58.629 --> 04:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
providers maintaining constant
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
Readiness yes that was specifically um
 
04:35:04.750 --> 04:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
part of what was required in CER Bill
 
04:35:12.269 --> 04:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
407 from last session um so um that was
 
04:35:16.029 --> 04:35:16.039 align:start position:0%
talked about and um accounted for in the
 
04:35:19.029 --> 04:35:19.039 align:start position:0%
race schedule thank
 
04:35:22.029 --> 04:35:22.039 align:start position:0%
you representative burrow did you have a
 
04:35:24.230 --> 04:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
question this is a would you believe and
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
and the other representative uh said
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
something what I was going to say that
 
04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
was the commissioner that was one of the
 
04:35:32.830 --> 04:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
clearest and most concise um
 
04:35:34.869 --> 04:35:34.879 align:start position:0%
presentations about this issue that I've
 
04:35:37.470 --> 04:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
ever heard and Alex that was great I
 
04:35:39.070 --> 04:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
think it could be a major motion picture
 
04:35:43.310 --> 04:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
at some point so thank you thank you who
 
04:35:46.269 --> 04:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
would watch it other than
 
04:35:50.109 --> 04:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
us my wife would watch it keep it short
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thank you for
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
letting me ask the question it was very
 
04:35:57.310 --> 04:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
clear thank you but I just wanted to
 
04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
make sure I understood maybe a little
 
04:36:02.230 --> 04:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
bit more on the conclusions so the
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
information was presented to the
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
providers and the carriers and was there
 
04:36:10.869 --> 04:36:10.879 align:start position:0%
subsequent discussion are you allowed to
 
04:36:13.029 --> 04:36:13.039 align:start position:0%
comment on that
 
04:36:15.750 --> 04:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
and where where we are kind of right now
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
between the providers and the carriers
 
04:36:20.709 --> 04:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
was there any progress made or that's
 
04:36:22.869 --> 04:36:22.879 align:start position:0%
why we're here today you know as the
 
04:36:26.830 --> 04:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned um virtually all
 
04:36:30.150 --> 04:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
of the the meetings occurred at a point
 
04:36:31.629 --> 04:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
where we were just talking about our
 
04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
process and we didn't have the final
 
04:36:39.230 --> 04:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
numbers so um we got you know some
 
04:36:45.429 --> 04:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
response um but most of the
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
um uh response was held back
 
04:36:53.230 --> 04:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
until the final numbers was was reached
 
04:36:56.070 --> 04:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't until very
 
04:37:00.029 --> 04:37:00.039 align:start position:0%
recently all right think you want add no
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
I would just say Obviously we worked as
 
04:37:04.390 --> 04:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
quickly as we possibly could as you may
 
04:37:06.429 --> 04:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
know we ended up having to ask for a
 
04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
week's extension we really wanted to
 
04:37:12.629 --> 04:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that the
 
04:37:14.830 --> 04:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
data that we were given and the
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
conclusions of PCG were making were
 
04:37:19.949 --> 04:37:19.959 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples comparisons as best as
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
possible again the data that was
 
04:37:24.390 --> 04:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
factored into the analysis was data that
 
04:37:27.789 --> 04:37:27.799 align:start position:0%
the providers put forward not all of the
 
04:37:30.390 --> 04:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
providers Gave Over the data in exactly
 
04:37:32.750 --> 04:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
the same way so we had to figure out
 
04:37:35.390 --> 04:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
ways to make them as comparable as
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
possible in some instances that was
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
easier than in others but throughout the
 
04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
process we really placed a very heavy
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
emphasis on fairness and
 
04:37:50.230 --> 04:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
again nobody's in love with the end
 
04:37:54.429 --> 04:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
result as I've said by my definition
 
04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
this is the perfect example of a
 
04:37:59.510 --> 04:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
compromise nobody's
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
thrilled each side has been asked to
 
04:38:03.949 --> 04:38:03.959 align:start position:0%
make sacrifices carriers have to pay
 
04:38:06.830 --> 04:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
more I think the providers need to
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
undertake a thorough and thoughtful
 
04:38:11.070 --> 04:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
consideration of their business model
 
04:38:13.629 --> 04:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
and make it adjustments to it to make
 
04:38:15.551 --> 04:38:15.561 align:start position:0%
their operations more financially
 
04:38:18.269 --> 04:38:18.279 align:start position:0%
sustainable for the long run but as Alex
 
04:38:21.429 --> 04:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned even in those areas where we
 
04:38:24.029 --> 04:38:24.039 align:start position:0%
understood there's going to be variation
 
04:38:25.830 --> 04:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
there are going to be factors that
 
04:38:28.551 --> 04:38:28.561 align:start position:0%
cannot be perfectly accounted
 
04:38:31.830 --> 04:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
for it built in that
 
04:38:34.510 --> 04:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
buffer to try to account for that in the
 
04:38:36.269 --> 04:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
political world if I were upholster I
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
would call it that margin of error if
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
you will and so we factored that in as
 
04:38:40.639 --> 04:38:46.510 align:start position:0%
you will and so we factored that in as
well

04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:49.029 --> 04:38:49.039 align:start position:0%
representative miles thank you Mr
 
04:38:51.789 --> 04:38:51.799 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you for taking my
 
04:38:54.830 --> 04:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
question I have a question back to the
 
04:38:58.429 --> 04:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
phrase uh cost sharing actually um I'm
 
04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
from a consumer spe perspective I'm
 
04:39:02.510 --> 04:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
sitting here looking at a pretty average
 
04:39:05.150 --> 04:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
health insurance card and uh as you
 
04:39:06.670 --> 04:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know you can see your
 
04:39:09.390 --> 04:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
co-pay your office visit deductible your
 
04:39:11.470 --> 04:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
specialist visit deductible for the
 
04:39:14.429 --> 04:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
consumer is it going to be apparent
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere such as their insurance card
 
04:39:20.230 --> 04:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
what that cost share is for an ambulance
 
04:39:21.910 --> 04:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
ride or is that going to be somewhere
 
04:39:24.070 --> 04:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
buried in the plan
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
documents probably factored into
 
04:39:26.160 --> 04:39:27.750 align:start position:0%
documents probably factored into
emergency

04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:39:30.551 --> 04:39:30.561 align:start position:0%
service yeah I think you're
 
04:39:32.949 --> 04:39:32.959 align:start position:0%
right so it's a bit difficult because
 
04:39:35.470 --> 04:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to vary from PL plan to plan
 
04:39:37.150 --> 04:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
so if you're in the individual Market
 
04:39:40.510 --> 04:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
you have the most control over the type
 
04:39:42.430 --> 04:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
of plan that you get you go on to The
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
Exchange number of different carriers
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
are offering a number of different plans
 
04:39:49.030 --> 04:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to have different options
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of Networks you're going to
 
04:39:52.110 --> 04:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
have different options in terms of
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
deductibles and all of that that'll get
 
04:39:58.590 --> 04:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
factored in I would say that we would
 
04:40:00.510 --> 04:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
certainly have a very serious
 
04:40:02.990 --> 04:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with the carriers about
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
making it far more clear to Consumers
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
what their deductible would be for
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance rides I was very
 
04:40:13.590 --> 04:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
briefly whispering to Alex here a second
 
04:40:15.910 --> 04:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
ago I think it would factor into
 
04:40:18.430 --> 04:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the deductible is for emergency
 
04:40:21.868 --> 04:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
plan thank you Commissioners uh
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
representative final
 
04:40:31.948 --> 04:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
question so uh thank you to thanks for
 
04:40:32.910 --> 04:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
taking a
 
04:40:37.550 --> 04:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
question has uh this model been uh as of
 
04:40:43.150 --> 04:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
this particular model no there are
 
04:40:48.310 --> 04:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
Concepts within this proposal individual
 
04:40:49.708 --> 04:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
Concepts that have been put in place in
 
04:40:52.030 --> 04:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
other states this particular model I
 
04:40:52.040 --> 04:40:53.070 align:start position:0%
other states this particular model I
don't

04:40:53.070 --> 04:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
believe is yeah implemented exactly in
 
04:40:58.030 --> 04:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
any other
 
04:41:02.430 --> 04:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
state there are um about 15 other states
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
that have tried in some way or another
 
04:41:07.110 --> 04:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
to deal with uh ambulance ground
 
04:41:10.350 --> 04:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
ambulance balance billing and to um
 
04:41:13.070 --> 04:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
address the reimbursement
 
04:41:16.270 --> 04:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
question uh I would say some of them
 
04:41:19.270 --> 04:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
have just uh left it up to a dispute
 
04:41:19.280 --> 04:41:20.868 align:start position:0%
have just uh left it up to a dispute
resolution

04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
04:41:24.510 --> 04:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
system and others have thrown a dart in
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
terms of uh picking um a level of
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement as a percent of Medicare
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would be the first state
 
04:41:36.310 --> 04:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
who actually based it on a cost
 
04:41:38.230 --> 04:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
study thank
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you Commissioners thank
 
04:41:44.628 --> 04:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
you uh commissioner beton Court I would
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate if when we go to subcommittee
 
04:41:50.590 --> 04:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
that could you provide hard copies of
 
04:41:53.830 --> 04:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
the study I know you have soft copies
 
04:41:55.430 --> 04:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
but if we could sit there and like make
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
notes on them yeah I think that we've
 
04:41:59.150 --> 04:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
got some copies or at least we had some
 
04:42:00.990 --> 04:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
copies of both the ambulance Summit
 
04:42:03.910 --> 04:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
report and the PCG report on the back
 
04:42:06.470 --> 04:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
table we need if we need more we can get
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
you more long story short we'll have
 
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
plenty of copies for all of you by the

currently am the a Regal director for

ambulance service for the cities of NASA
 
04:43:16.680 --> 04:43:18.350 align:start position:0%

04:43:20.590 --> 04:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh the New Hampshire
 
04:43:22.628 --> 04:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Association I want to make
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
this very clear from the gecko we
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
support action to Pro protect consumers
 
04:43:30.550 --> 04:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
from balance billing practices and
 
04:43:32.788 --> 04:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
regulations that ensure adequate
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for ambulance ground
 
04:43:37.270 --> 04:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
providers for the vital Services they
 
04:43:40.110 --> 04:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
provide we want to take the patient out
 
04:43:43.150 --> 04:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
of The Middle we've consistently said
 
04:43:47.030 --> 04:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
that all along that being said um ground
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers are essential
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
services and integral parts of the
 
04:43:52.750 --> 04:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
communities they serve they should be
 
04:43:55.230 --> 04:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
fairly reimbursed for those Services
 
04:43:57.990 --> 04:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
Federal lawmakers left ground ambulance
 
04:44:00.510 --> 04:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
providers out of the NSA as they feared
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
many of these Services would be reduced
 
04:44:05.110 --> 04:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
or closed in certain communities due to
 
04:44:07.350 --> 04:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
the funding challenges and felt they
 
04:44:09.788 --> 04:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
needed more time to evaluate reasonable
 
04:44:09.798 --> 04:44:11.990 align:start position:0%
needed more time to evaluate reasonable
reimbursement

04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
04:44:13.628 --> 04:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
at the same time they recognized that
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
consumers needed to be protected from
 
04:44:18.150 --> 04:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
unfair balanced billing practice and
 
04:44:19.868 --> 04:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
removed from the middle of payment
 
04:44:22.110 --> 04:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
disputes the federal government actually
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
put together a federal committee to
 
04:44:26.390 --> 04:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
study this it came out with a report
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
which I would be happy to provide to you
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
and our own uh Senator Apprentice from
 
04:44:33.750 --> 04:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was on that
 
04:44:36.430 --> 04:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
committee the New Hampshire ground
 
04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
ambulance study committee which was
 
04:44:40.510 --> 04:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
fully funded by the New Hampshire Health
 
04:44:43.510 --> 04:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
Plan and its member insurance companies
 
04:44:45.670 --> 04:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
actually statistically Prov that New
 
04:44:47.190 --> 04:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's ambulance services are
 
04:44:49.470 --> 04:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursed below cost by commercial
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
insurance providers as well as New
 
04:44:53.470 --> 04:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid and Medicare
 
04:44:55.948 --> 04:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
something we've been saying as many
 
04:44:58.030 --> 04:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
times as I've been at this
 
04:45:00.390 --> 04:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
microphone by choosing to continue to
 
04:45:02.230 --> 04:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
reimburse New Hampshire ambulance
 
04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
providers below cost the commercial
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
insurance providers in New Hampshire
 
04:45:08.270 --> 04:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
continue to force ambulance providers to
 
04:45:10.270 --> 04:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
balance bill patients so they can
 
04:45:13.708 --> 04:45:13.718 align:start position:0%
attempt to rec their operating costs we
 
04:45:17.628 --> 04:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
cannot support 316 in its current form
 
04:45:19.990 --> 04:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
we believe that the rates recommended
 
04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
which are actually
 
04:45:24.110 --> 04:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
197% of the
 
04:45:27.670 --> 04:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
2025 Medicare rate do not reflect the
 
04:45:30.070 --> 04:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
impact of the loss of Revenue that New
 
04:45:31.628 --> 04:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ambulance providers would
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
experience if they were no longer
 
04:45:35.230 --> 04:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to balance
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
Bill mandating those recommended rates
 
04:45:40.110 --> 04:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
and prohibiting balance billing would
 
04:45:42.750 --> 04:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
result in a significant net loss to New
 
04:45:44.750 --> 04:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ambulance providers and will
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
put further pressure on an EMS system
 
04:45:48.550 --> 04:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
already in
 
04:45:51.230 --> 04:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
crisis desperately what we're trying to
 
04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
avoid and in direct opposition to what
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
the ambulance
 
04:45:59.670 --> 04:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
Summit came up with for its Mission
 
04:46:02.788 --> 04:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
which was to make this a revenue neutral
 
04:46:06.190 --> 04:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
process it is not Revenue neutral as put
 
04:46:08.628 --> 04:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
forward for either
 
04:46:10.990 --> 04:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
side other parts of the proposed
 
04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
legislation impose insurance industry
 
04:46:15.230 --> 04:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
friendly conditions that potentially
 
04:46:16.990 --> 04:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
reduce reimbursement levels and
 
04:46:18.990 --> 04:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
potentially tie reimbursement to
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
continued public fund subsidization I.E
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
property taxes Things Not Seen in any
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire commercial insurance
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursement situation that I know
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
of I also wanted to point out I I
 
04:46:35.590 --> 04:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
apologize making notes as commissioner
 
04:46:37.150 --> 04:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
and his staff have been talking there's
 
04:46:39.548 --> 04:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that I I just have a
 
04:46:41.910 --> 04:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
couple of questions on there are 11
 
04:46:44.470 --> 04:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
states that have passed legislation
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
relative to ambulance billing and almost
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
all of them are well above the
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
197% that is being recommended by
 
04:46:58.030 --> 04:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
PCG uh Arkansas pays at the rate that
 
04:47:00.150 --> 04:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
the ambulance provider bills that's
 
04:47:02.190 --> 04:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
selected by the elected officials in the
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
community where the
 
04:47:07.830 --> 04:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
ambulance um transport takes place so
 
04:47:12.310 --> 04:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
does California Colorado pays AT3 25%
 
04:47:15.230 --> 04:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
Indiana pays at 400% of Medicare
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
Louisiana at
 
04:47:21.310 --> 04:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
325 Maine at 180% and I will note that
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
main just had to come up with $15
 
04:47:25.548 --> 04:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
million to subsidize the ambulance
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
providers in the state because their
 
04:47:29.628 --> 04:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
attempt at balance billing control was a
 
04:47:31.390 --> 04:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
disaster and that's been talked about in
 
04:47:34.430 --> 04:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
this committee before Mississippi is at
 
04:47:38.470 --> 04:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
3 125% Ohio is at
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
100% Oklahoma Texas and Washington are
 
04:47:44.910 --> 04:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
all at 325 per. and that was our
 
04:47:47.590 --> 04:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation last year when we were
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
before this
 
04:47:52.110 --> 04:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
committee I also want to point out that
 
04:47:55.590 --> 04:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
the advisory groups were not informed of
 
04:47:58.910 --> 04:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
the result of the study we were kept
 
04:48:00.830 --> 04:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
well informed about the process of the
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
study all the way through but the only
 
04:48:05.470 --> 04:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
way I found out about the study was from
 
04:48:07.548 --> 04:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
a text from a friend of mine who said
 
04:48:09.310 --> 04:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
hey it's been released and then I went
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
and looked at it
 
04:48:14.430 --> 04:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
and lastly um commercial insurance
 
04:48:16.948 --> 04:48:16.958 align:start position:0%
providers to the best of my knowledge
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
are not typically paying Medicare rates
 
04:48:21.990 --> 04:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
if you recall we passed a bill last year
 
04:48:25.030 --> 04:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
on direct pay and that direct pay was
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
the result of insurance providers
 
04:48:31.190 --> 04:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
sending checks directly to patients when
 
04:48:33.030 --> 04:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
an outof Network ambulance provider
 
04:48:35.150 --> 04:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
picked them up and those checks were
 
04:48:37.830 --> 04:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
very substantial in some cases people
 
04:48:39.628 --> 04:48:39.638 align:start position:0%
were committing fraud they were so
 
04:48:41.788 --> 04:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
substantial and they were not at
 
04:48:44.070 --> 04:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
Medicare rates they were often times at
 
04:48:46.990 --> 04:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
usual and customary rates I understand
 
04:48:48.590 --> 04:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
that there may be differences between
 
04:48:51.548 --> 04:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
Arisa plans and non-erisa plans but I do
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
not believe in any way shape or form
 
04:48:56.110 --> 04:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
that the typical commercial insurance
 
04:48:59.990 --> 04:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
payment is 100% of
 
04:49:02.230 --> 04:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare um thank you for your time I'm
 
04:49:04.190 --> 04:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
happy to uh we want to get to the right
 
04:49:06.670 --> 04:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
number we want to do this as much as
 
04:49:09.948 --> 04:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
anybody else does but we don't think and
 
04:49:12.390 --> 04:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
I'll use commissioner beton Court's um
 
04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
number that the Delta is anywhere near
 
04:49:23.070 --> 04:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.310 --> 04:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
number thank you Chris um representative
 
04:49:29.910 --> 04:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
miles thank
 
04:49:32.310 --> 04:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my
 
04:49:36.788 --> 04:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
question um can you tell me would balanc
 
04:49:40.110 --> 04:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
billing enable EMS services to pay more
 
04:49:40.120 --> 04:49:41.628 align:start position:0%
billing enable EMS services to pay more
competitive

04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
04:49:46.190 --> 04:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
wages to paramedics and then if so would
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
an increase in those wages allow us to
 
04:49:53.230 --> 04:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
have and provide greater amount of EMS
 
04:49:57.030 --> 04:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
services to more people of New Hampshire
 
04:49:57.040 --> 04:50:00.190 align:start position:0%
services to more people of New Hampshire
or

04:50:00.190 --> 04:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
not that's a great question we we our
 
04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
industry un not unlike health care or
 
04:50:08.070 --> 04:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
Public Safety is struggling to retain
 
04:50:09.670 --> 04:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
people that are qualified to provide
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
services um many of the uh Services
 
04:50:14.830 --> 04:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
particularly in rural areas right now
 
04:50:16.990 --> 04:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
have a difficult time attracting staff
 
04:50:18.990 --> 04:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
if you remove the ability to balance
 
04:50:21.708 --> 04:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
Bill and don't fill that gap between
 
04:50:24.270 --> 04:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
what the service is collecting now and
 
04:50:26.030 --> 04:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
what they will collect in the future you
 
04:50:28.270 --> 04:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
will significantly impact the ability of
 
04:50:30.590 --> 04:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
them to continue to provide
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
services I don't believe that the study
 
04:50:35.470 --> 04:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
at least I haven't been able to see it
 
04:50:37.070 --> 04:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
in the study I don't believe that the
 
04:50:39.070 --> 04:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
study properly account or actually
 
04:50:41.230 --> 04:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
accounted for that Delta at all it
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
looked at the cost and I understand that
 
04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
but it did not look at the cost that
 
04:50:48.868 --> 04:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
will be lost by not being able to
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
collect what the insurers are paying now
 
04:50:54.030 --> 04:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
if they were paying 100% of Medicare as
 
04:50:55.868 --> 04:50:55.878 align:start position:0%
as um the gentleman from the insurance
 
04:50:58.628 --> 04:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
commission said I would understand that
 
04:51:07.230 --> 04:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:10.030 --> 04:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
are I just wondered if you have any
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
documentation that you were reading off
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
of that we could have a copy for
 
04:51:17.310 --> 04:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
everyone here oh sure absolutely email
 
04:51:21.628 --> 04:51:21.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:24.030 --> 04:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair
 
04:51:30.470 --> 04:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
um we had a lot of discussion in the
 
04:51:33.628 --> 04:51:33.638 align:start position:0%
last session about the problem of
 
04:51:35.470 --> 04:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
insurance company sending the check to
 
04:51:38.430 --> 04:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
the patient rather than to the ambulance
 
04:51:41.070 --> 04:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
provider and that this resulted in loss
 
04:51:43.350 --> 04:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
to the ambulance providers because they
 
04:51:45.310 --> 04:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
had to track down the patient and the
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
money and it didn't always come through
 
04:51:51.510 --> 04:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
and what I'm wondering is does direct
 
04:51:56.590 --> 04:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
payment provide um an advantage to the
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers that might at least
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat offset the problems that have
 
04:52:02.040 --> 04:52:02.788 align:start position:0%
somewhat offset the problems that have
been

04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:52:05.948 --> 04:52:05.958 align:start position:0%
discussed the financial problems I do
 
04:52:08.670 --> 04:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
believe that by enacting that law which
 
04:52:12.110 --> 04:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
we did last year that that has helped
 
04:52:14.670 --> 04:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
yes well there is there is some
 
04:52:17.830 --> 04:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
Advantage for direct pay absolutely yes
 
04:52:21.070 --> 04:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
um you don't have any comparison I'm not
 
04:52:23.788 --> 04:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
looking for numbers just generalities I
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
I don't um the organization that I work
 
04:52:28.548 --> 04:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
for we are in network with the largest
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
insurance carer so we didn't have that
 
04:52:33.070 --> 04:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
issue um but and I can't speak for
 
04:52:35.390 --> 04:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
others that may not be in
 
04:52:41.070 --> 04:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:44.190 --> 04:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
all thank you you mentioned 11 states
 
04:52:46.628 --> 04:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
that are paying doing a better job of
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
paying the uh providers you guys
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:58.230 --> 04:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
yeah do any of those States because I
 
04:52:59.910 --> 04:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
haven't done that research yet so I want
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
to do it so but but I want to do it
 
04:53:06.110 --> 04:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
states are they coming out of is some of
 
04:53:12.628 --> 04:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
the money coming out of taxes or you
 
04:53:15.150 --> 04:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
know property tax any kind of tax or is
 
04:53:17.390 --> 04:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
it all coming from the insurance
 
04:53:19.750 --> 04:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
companies um my understanding is it's
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
all coming from the insurance companies
 
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
but I be would be happy to provide you
 
04:53:24.430 --> 04:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
with the documentation it's actually a
 
04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
white paper so it's got sources for all
 
04:53:28.430 --> 04:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
the things that are in there so you
 
04:53:30.430 --> 04:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
could you could take a look at that I I
 
04:53:32.470 --> 04:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
also understand that um there's going to
 
04:53:35.470 --> 04:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
be a bill introduced in Massachusetts uh
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
I Believe by the end of the week that
 
04:53:40.750 --> 04:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
will be similar to to the one that you
 
04:53:43.830 --> 04:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
see here in New Hampshire but will be at
 
04:53:47.510 --> 04:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
won't be 197 it'll be at at um whatever
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
the community rate is set by the elected
 
04:53:59.948 --> 04:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:59.958 --> 04:54:05.470 align:start position:0%
 
Medicare

04:54:05.470 --> 04:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:05.480 --> 04:54:08.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:54:08.948 --> 04:54:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:11.868 --> 04:54:11.878 align:start position:0%

04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me um my name is Michael sear I'm
 
04:55:03.948 --> 04:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
the chief of the Tilton offield fire
 
04:55:06.030 --> 04:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
district today I'm here representing the
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of Fire Chiefs
 
04:55:12.548 --> 04:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
and to basically speak right now that uh
 
04:55:14.230 --> 04:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
as the bill stands
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
currently uh we are opposed to the bill
 
04:55:21.628 --> 04:55:21.638 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons are that the amount
 
04:55:23.470 --> 04:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
proposed in the bill for reimbursement
 
04:55:26.990 --> 04:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
to Providers is substantially lower than
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
what we need to
 
04:55:29.400 --> 04:55:31.510 align:start position:0%
what we need to
survive

04:55:31.510 --> 04:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
survive
 
04:55:34.510 --> 04:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
the um one of the points that
 
04:55:37.628 --> 04:55:37.638 align:start position:0%
commissioner talked about was the delta
 
04:55:40.350 --> 04:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
in regards to Medicare
 
04:55:42.590 --> 04:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
providers Medicare Medicaid providers
 
04:55:45.868 --> 04:55:45.878 align:start position:0%
and private insurance providers and uh I
 
04:55:47.750 --> 04:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
can speak specifically to Tilton not
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
field fire we have our own Billing
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
System a formula that was uh approved by
 
04:55:55.830 --> 04:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
the elected Board of fire Commissioners
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
and is enacted and the formula is
 
04:55:59.628 --> 04:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
adjusted every year and through that
 
04:56:01.868 --> 04:56:01.878 align:start position:0%
formula and through my testimony which
 
04:56:05.868 --> 04:56:05.878 align:start position:0%
will be shared with you um it'll show
 
04:56:08.230 --> 04:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
the Delta that of there's a far leftand
 
04:56:12.548 --> 04:56:12.558 align:start position:0%
Corner that the rates proposed by the
 
04:56:15.110 --> 04:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
commission and then my rates and then
 
04:56:16.548 --> 04:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
the far right hand corner shows the
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
delta in those
 
04:56:24.750 --> 04:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:26.990 --> 04:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
not it' be easier to say that the
 
04:56:29.910 --> 04:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
revenue we collect from billing it goes
 
04:56:31.750 --> 04:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
to offset the tax
 
04:56:35.350 --> 04:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
rate if we collect less the tax rate
 
04:56:37.868 --> 04:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
goes up or we have to reduce Services
 
04:56:40.830 --> 04:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
that's the basic bottom line of it it's
 
04:56:43.590 --> 04:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's uh not that complicated I have and
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
if you want I can share how we got our
 
04:56:48.628 --> 04:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
policy and our formula and we show you
 
04:56:50.548 --> 04:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
all the math there's nothing hitting
 
04:56:53.868 --> 04:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
about it as public documents at any
 
04:56:53.878 --> 04:56:56.830 align:start position:0%
about it as public documents at any
rate

04:56:56.830 --> 04:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
rate
 
04:56:59.548 --> 04:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
um think something and I'd be happy to
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:07.548 --> 04:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
short representative
 
04:57:09.670 --> 04:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thanks for taking my question
 
04:57:12.868 --> 04:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
so you said that this wouldn't be a good
 
04:57:15.230 --> 04:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
enough um reimbursement to be able to
 
04:57:17.110 --> 04:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
survive that's what you just said right
 
04:57:19.150 --> 04:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
so you are you do you think you guys
 
04:57:23.390 --> 04:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
would actually have to close if if this
 
04:57:26.910 --> 04:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
bill is were to get passed survive is
 
04:57:29.190 --> 04:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
probably a poor choice of words what
 
04:57:31.390 --> 04:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
would happen if this bill passes in its
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
current form is that either we would
 
04:57:35.070 --> 04:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
reduce our
 
04:57:37.948 --> 04:57:37.958 align:start position:0%
services or we would have to increase
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
the uh burden on the taxpayer to
 
04:57:43.830 --> 04:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
maintain what we currently do okay other
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
question if you may qu my inquire thank
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
you um okay
 
04:57:53.510 --> 04:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is now you guys get
 
04:57:55.430 --> 04:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
you do the balance billing and you get
 
04:57:57.230 --> 04:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
the check mailed to you instead of to
 
04:57:59.230 --> 04:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
the patient because we changed that last
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
term is that correct that's correct that
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
was enacted late last year so I haven't
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
had a full um quite a bit of time to
 
04:58:09.350 --> 04:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
research how that's affected us but I'm
 
04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
sure it's a positive so my question then
 
04:58:15.990 --> 04:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
is um is it possible uh and I know you
 
04:58:17.310 --> 04:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
don't really know this hasn't happened
 
04:58:18.310 --> 04:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
yet and it sounds like you don't have a
 
04:58:20.230 --> 04:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
full understanding of the impact of that
 
04:58:23.150 --> 04:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
change that we did but is it possible
 
04:58:27.548 --> 04:58:27.558 align:start position:0%
that this bill would actually like is
 
04:58:29.150 --> 04:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
there a scenario where you can think of
 
04:58:30.510 --> 04:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
where you could actually get more money
 
04:58:33.190 --> 04:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
under this situation versus the current
 
04:58:36.390 --> 04:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
situation where you have to chase down
 
04:58:38.070 --> 04:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and or patients to
 
04:58:42.670 --> 04:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:44.910 --> 04:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I I'm going to suggest that it's
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
going to be have a the bill that
 
04:58:48.470 --> 04:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that passed last year with
 
04:58:50.070 --> 04:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
this direct payment is going to have a
 
04:58:52.948 --> 04:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
positive effect on our collection rate
 
04:58:55.788 --> 04:58:55.798 align:start position:0%
um so you think that would be better
 
04:58:58.230 --> 04:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
than you're assuming the numbers that
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
we're getting under that old the bill
 
04:59:03.230 --> 04:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
that we passed last year is going to uh
 
04:59:04.830 --> 04:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
be better than what we have now that's
 
04:59:06.430 --> 04:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
the Assumption you're offering you're
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
operating under I right my assumption is
 
04:59:10.230 --> 04:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
that our collection rate will be better
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
being that we don't have to chase down
 
04:59:16.230 --> 04:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
um instate Insurance private insurance
 
04:59:18.990 --> 04:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
providers that um don't pay the full
 
04:59:22.750 --> 04:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
amount um as a side note at Tilton
 
04:59:24.788 --> 04:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
Northfield fire we have a process if
 
04:59:26.948 --> 04:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
people can't afford to pay the bill we
 
04:59:29.350 --> 04:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
have a process where they can be uh go
 
04:59:32.190 --> 04:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
through to say that you know they're
 
04:59:33.948 --> 04:59:33.958 align:start position:0%
Indigent or they're poor they just can't
 
04:59:36.270 --> 04:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
afford it we've never taken anybody to
 
04:59:37.948 --> 04:59:37.958 align:start position:0%
court and we've never reported anybody
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
to the uh their credit rating so uh
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
we're very mindful of that and and I
 
04:59:46.948 --> 04:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
think we're very careful but it's there
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
are times where um people have in the
 
04:59:52.150 --> 04:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
past received checks from insurance
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
companies and have not forwarded those
 
04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
payments to us but that has been taken
 
04:59:59.190 --> 04:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
care of gotcha so but it that's only for
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
instate providers so if uh I come from
 
05:00:04.628 --> 05:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
the Lakes Region we're very heavily
 
05:00:07.350 --> 05:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
tourist business industry we have a a a
 
05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
bike park where we have nearly 100 runs
 
05:00:11.310 --> 05:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
a year with people with severe trauma
 
05:00:13.390 --> 05:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
that we end up bringing to a hospital a
 
05:00:15.868 --> 05:00:15.878 align:start position:0%
lot of those uh patients are from out of
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
state and have out of state private
 
05:00:18.600 --> 05:00:20.310 align:start position:0%
state and have out of state private
providers

05:00:20.310 --> 05:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:00:22.708 --> 05:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
um they would not fall under this
 
05:00:25.310 --> 05:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
legislation and um but as the
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
legislation stands we still wouldn't be
 
05:00:29.708 --> 05:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
able to balance the billum gotcha uh
 
05:00:31.590 --> 05:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and would you believe it
 
05:00:34.750 --> 05:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
would be helpful I think if you or
 
05:00:36.788 --> 05:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
anybody else who's you know another
 
05:00:40.150 --> 05:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
ambulance organization here maybe when
 
05:00:41.750 --> 05:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee time comes around it
 
05:00:43.310 --> 05:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
would be it would be helpful if we had
 
05:00:45.510 --> 05:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
some insight into the impact of the
 
05:00:47.350 --> 05:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
changes we made last year and then we
 
05:00:49.750 --> 05:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
could compare to the potential outcomes
 
05:00:51.708 --> 05:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
from this potential bill just as we
 
05:00:53.110 --> 05:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
think through this incredibly
 
05:00:56.788 --> 05:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
complicated Pro process or problem like
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
you have sat in this chair a few times
 
05:01:01.390 --> 05:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
good observation representative very
 
05:01:01.400 --> 05:01:03.230 align:start position:0%
good observation representative very
good

05:01:03.230 --> 05:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:01:05.548 --> 05:01:05.558 align:start position:0%
observation thank
 
05:01:08.230 --> 05:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
you you
 
05:01:12.430 --> 05:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
question go ahead um so if someone is
 
05:01:14.948 --> 05:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
hurt up in the Lakes Region and their
 
05:01:17.948 --> 05:01:17.958 align:start position:0%
insurance is in another state you're not
 
05:01:21.708 --> 05:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
able to Bill we do send them a bill we
 
05:01:23.548 --> 05:01:23.558 align:start position:0%
send the bill mainly to the insurance
 
05:01:26.830 --> 05:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
agent to the insurance company um but if
 
05:01:28.230 --> 05:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
they're insurance companies from New
 
05:01:30.270 --> 05:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
York or Connecticut or Massachusetts or
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
whatever those insurance companies are
 
05:01:36.310 --> 05:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
follow the laws of that state not the
 
05:01:39.990 --> 05:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so if we're
 
05:01:42.350 --> 05:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
certainly out of network provider for
 
05:01:45.510 --> 05:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
any out ofst State insurance company and
 
05:01:50.030 --> 05:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
so um they will send us a check or the
 
05:01:52.270 --> 05:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
the pro patient a check rather than
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
sending it to us and it's certainly for
 
05:01:56.750 --> 05:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
a lot less of what than what it
 
05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
cost thank you very much you're
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Michael thank you very
 
05:02:07.110 --> 05:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
much okay next will be Miss Paula Rogers
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:16.750 --> 05:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you very much Vice
 
05:02:19.350 --> 05:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um for the record my name is
 
05:02:21.708 --> 05:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
Paula Rogers and I'm here on behalf of
 
05:02:23.948 --> 05:02:23.958 align:start position:0%
America's health insurance
 
05:02:26.310 --> 05:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
plans and I just wanted to comment
 
05:02:28.708 --> 05:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
briefly on the bill and I've listened of
 
05:02:30.150 --> 05:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
course to the testimony and the
 
05:02:32.310 --> 05:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
presentation of the Departments and I
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
can personally attest to the fact that
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
ambulance bills have been the bane of
 
05:02:40.150 --> 05:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
everybody's existence
 
05:02:42.670 --> 05:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
they seem insoluble and we we got we've
 
05:02:47.230 --> 05:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
gone in circles and we've labored over a
 
05:02:49.390 --> 05:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
number of sessions about direction of
 
05:02:53.628 --> 05:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
payment should it go to the member in a
 
05:02:56.590 --> 05:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
non-contracted situation I mean in a
 
05:02:58.830 --> 05:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
contracted situation surely in an
 
05:03:01.590 --> 05:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
uncontracted situation there's no
 
05:03:06.030 --> 05:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
contract with the uncontracted ambulance
 
05:03:08.868 --> 05:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
core so we had historically sent the
 
05:03:11.868 --> 05:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
check to the member the only person with
 
05:03:14.590 --> 05:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
whom we have a a relationship and of
 
05:03:16.310 --> 05:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
course that put the providers in this
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
awkward situation of having to
 
05:03:21.788 --> 05:03:21.798 align:start position:0%
chase the
 
05:03:24.628 --> 05:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
money then a bill was passed that said
 
05:03:26.788 --> 05:03:26.798 align:start position:0%
well plans you can send it in either
 
05:03:29.430 --> 05:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
direction and finally the most recent
 
05:03:33.548 --> 05:03:33.558 align:start position:0%
one is send it to the person I mean to
 
05:03:37.868 --> 05:03:37.878 align:start position:0%
the provider and I am sure that there
 
05:03:40.510 --> 05:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
has been some benefit to the providers
 
05:03:42.628 --> 05:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
how large that benefit is I don't know
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to solve the whole
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
problem you're working on here when I
 
05:03:49.070 --> 05:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
heard the department presentation I was
 
05:03:51.548 --> 05:03:51.558 align:start position:0%
frankly very impressed with the lengths
 
05:03:56.070 --> 05:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
they went to to get a consultant lined
 
05:03:59.230 --> 05:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
up the cooperation of the
 
05:04:02.390 --> 05:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
providers and now we have some results
 
05:04:06.390 --> 05:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
and ahip as a Association of health
 
05:04:10.788 --> 05:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
plans we don't wildly Embrace government
 
05:04:13.510 --> 05:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
rate setting so we're hesitant on that
 
05:04:15.708 --> 05:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
part of the bill but I have to tell you
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
in sort of a convenience factor the
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
study is very informative and very
 
05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
helpful as a source of data because the
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
Contracting process is fraught between
 
05:04:31.310 --> 05:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
plans and providers and the ambulance
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
providers there's a long history of this
 
05:04:36.990 --> 05:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
issue and it does have an it has gravity
 
05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
in almost every state I suspect I was
 
05:04:42.708 --> 05:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
surprised to hear Mr STW say that there
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
are 11 states that have some sort of
 
05:04:46.990 --> 05:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
rate setting
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
system and representative spear when you
 
05:04:51.230 --> 05:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
said you were going to do some research
 
05:04:53.230 --> 05:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
on it so am I because I was aware of
 
05:04:56.030 --> 05:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and perhaps one other state
 
05:04:58.350 --> 05:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
but it's interesting and it might be
 
05:05:00.548 --> 05:05:00.558 align:start position:0%
interesting historically to see what
 
05:05:02.548 --> 05:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
finally had those States decide we've
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
got to do something about this I'm not
 
05:05:06.430 --> 05:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
sure where we are in New Hampshire at
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
that at this point I'm not with the kind
 
05:05:12.070 --> 05:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
of knowledge that I would know that the
 
05:05:15.270 --> 05:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
one thing in the bill 3516 that I wanted
 
05:05:17.948 --> 05:05:17.958 align:start position:0%
to say that we support is something to
 
05:05:20.190 --> 05:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
address balance billing and I agree with
 
05:05:22.868 --> 05:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
the commissioner the patient is is in
 
05:05:26.070 --> 05:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
the is in the middle on that and uh it's
 
05:05:28.110 --> 05:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
really very important that we do
 
05:05:30.070 --> 05:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
something about it I mean I've heard the
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
Prov the ambulance
 
05:05:34.590 --> 05:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
providers suggest their reluctance to
 
05:05:36.310 --> 05:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
sort of embrace that but I think it's
 
05:05:39.070 --> 05:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
something that the committee can work on
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
and and see see if there's some
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
constructive way can we can get over
 
05:05:43.868 --> 05:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
that hump because there was a hump at
 
05:05:45.788 --> 05:05:45.798 align:start position:0%
the federal level and that ground
 
05:05:48.470 --> 05:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
ambulance was not provided by Federal
 
05:05:49.948 --> 05:05:49.958 align:start position:0%
Protection and when the state's picked
 
05:05:52.590 --> 05:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
up on it they too have held back on on
 
05:05:55.110 --> 05:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh ambulance provision services so I
 
05:05:57.150 --> 05:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make those comments but
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
most of all I know that's it's it's a
 
05:06:01.270 --> 05:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's a Hu you're going to have to have a
 
05:06:03.990 --> 05:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
very large subcommittee it's a workload
 
05:06:04.000 --> 05:06:04.750 align:start position:0%
very large subcommittee it's a workload
and

05:06:04.750 --> 05:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:06:07.788 --> 05:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's intensive you're
 
05:06:09.310 --> 05:06:09.320 align:start position:0%
really going to have to pay attention
 
05:06:11.750 --> 05:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
because it's it's such a vital issue to
 
05:06:14.788 --> 05:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
the plans and to the providers
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
and plans may be reluctant but we need
 
05:06:19.628 --> 05:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
to be realistic and we need to look at
 
05:06:24.270 --> 05:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:27.270 --> 05:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
discussion representor
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
steer I'm not positive this is a
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
question or a comment re related to a
 
05:06:39.070 --> 05:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
question but some of the uh states that
 
05:06:43.350 --> 05:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
were settled off have state subsidies
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
for their health
 
05:06:48.070 --> 05:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
plans and so the question
 
05:06:50.868 --> 05:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
is and that I want to research and find
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
out how many of those states are
 
05:06:55.948 --> 05:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
subsidizing their ambulance plans with
 
05:06:58.868 --> 05:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
state taxes which is fine I mean they're
 
05:07:00.548 --> 05:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome to do that and they do
 
05:07:03.788 --> 05:07:03.798 align:start position:0%
that in a lot of a number of a number of
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
areas we have to decide if we can afford
 
05:07:09.150 --> 05:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
that but that's another issue I no I I
 
05:07:12.150 --> 05:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
think that's an important uh observation
 
05:07:16.030 --> 05:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
and research needs to be done so I'm all
 
05:07:17.868 --> 05:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
interested in see how seeing how this
 
05:07:19.948 --> 05:07:19.958 align:start position:0%
develops quite frankly I hope we get the
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
list of those 11 states okay thank
 
05:07:28.110 --> 05:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Sullivan oh
 
05:07:30.830 --> 05:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry this I know this thing blocks
 
05:07:33.470 --> 05:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
I can't see your face um yes the
 
05:07:36.190 --> 05:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
previous speaker said that we when
 
05:07:38.750 --> 05:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
somebody from a touristy area which I
 
05:07:41.470 --> 05:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
represent so it's it's why I'm asking
 
05:07:43.788 --> 05:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
this question when somebody comes to
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
these tourist locations and they're
 
05:07:46.948 --> 05:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
coming from New York or Massachusetts or
 
05:07:49.708 --> 05:07:49.718 align:start position:0%
wherever out of state then they send the
 
05:07:51.390 --> 05:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
balance bill or the balance of the bill
 
05:07:53.110 --> 05:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
to or a the bill whatever they're
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
sending to the insurance company in that
 
05:07:58.510 --> 05:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
state and then they're regulated by the
 
05:08:01.670 --> 05:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
state that they're in so B Massachusetts
 
05:08:04.590 --> 05:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
New York whatever it might be um I'm
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
curious maybe you know how it impacts
 
05:08:11.190 --> 05:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so if I am insured and I
 
05:08:14.070 --> 05:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
go get hurt in I don't know the birk
 
05:08:17.310 --> 05:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
shears and like how when they send their
 
05:08:19.750 --> 05:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
bill to you guys do you guys just say we
 
05:08:21.150 --> 05:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
abide by New Hampshire laws and so you
 
05:08:22.230 --> 05:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
have to pay the balance of the bill or
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
how does that work well it's going to
 
05:08:25.948 --> 05:08:25.958 align:start position:0%
vary from company to company but one
 
05:08:29.990 --> 05:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
thing I will tell you is that when I was
 
05:08:33.670 --> 05:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
in a company we often struggled with the
 
05:08:35.628 --> 05:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
issue of well it was a Blue Cross
 
05:08:38.070 --> 05:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
company so people would say well the C
 
05:08:40.190 --> 05:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
says Blue Cross on it
 
05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
and yes but it's Blue Cross of
 
05:08:45.990 --> 05:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and you're in New Hampshire
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
so you've got a billing issue you know
 
05:08:50.670 --> 05:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
in another state and you do have to deal
 
05:08:54.150 --> 05:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
with the other state there are um
 
05:08:59.310 --> 05:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
service agencies that can deal in in
 
05:09:02.788 --> 05:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
basically assisting and I I actually
 
05:09:04.270 --> 05:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
encountered one I've forgotten where it
 
05:09:05.590 --> 05:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
was located on the border of
 
05:09:07.230 --> 05:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts over in the Portsmouth
 
05:09:09.990 --> 05:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
area where they were doing claims
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
because there were a lot of crossb
 
05:09:14.110 --> 05:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
issues and they were basically servicing
 
05:09:16.470 --> 05:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
the claims and making sure that the
 
05:09:19.270 --> 05:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
providers who have more things to do
 
05:09:22.590 --> 05:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
than worry about which ambulance Ser um
 
05:09:25.708 --> 05:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
which insurer you have to pursue to get
 
05:09:28.430 --> 05:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
your ambulance claim paid so it's a
 
05:09:29.910 --> 05:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
complicated matter and I don't think
 
05:09:33.070 --> 05:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
there's one clear answer to the question
 
05:09:34.350 --> 05:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
you just
 
05:09:39.750 --> 05:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:43.350 --> 05:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you Paul you thank you next
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%

05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
yourdon they have um Chris already
 
05:10:20.548 --> 05:10:20.558 align:start position:0%
represented the association's position
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
on this bill I guess from my standpoint
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
just being a paramedic of 30 something
 
05:10:27.590 --> 05:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
years longer than I really care to admit
 
05:10:28.948 --> 05:10:28.958 align:start position:0%
Chris has been longer though just for
 
05:10:32.548 --> 05:10:32.558 align:start position:0%
the record um the uh I just have wanted
 
05:10:33.750 --> 05:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
is there any questions for the new
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
members about the actual you know what
 
05:10:37.590 --> 05:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
what what it is an ambulance does you
 
05:10:38.990 --> 05:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
know what it is that happens here in the
 
05:10:40.510 --> 05:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
state what is different than other
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
states you know what is the you know
 
05:10:44.310 --> 05:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
components that maybe some you know a
 
05:10:46.510 --> 05:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
lot of members here have been in this
 
05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
group for years and years and years not
 
05:10:51.590 --> 05:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
me this is only my third time here not
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
like Chris I was just curious again um
 
05:10:56.070 --> 05:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know this issue was new to me
 
05:10:58.030 --> 05:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
several years ago when it started you
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
know the weaponization of reimbursement
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies you know
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
had um initiated quite a long time ago
 
05:11:07.910 --> 05:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
the problems of reconciling you know
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
Readiness with you know what that cost
 
05:11:11.830 --> 05:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
was you know and just the expectation
 
05:11:13.788 --> 05:11:13.798 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire um just so you're
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
aware when you dial 911 anywhere in New
 
05:11:18.350 --> 05:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you get the same answering
 
05:11:20.470 --> 05:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
Point regardless and you know the
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
expectation that's created by that you
 
05:11:24.788 --> 05:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
know what is your emergency when they
 
05:11:26.190 --> 05:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
answer that phone line I was just
 
05:11:27.990 --> 05:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
curious if I could answer any questions
 
05:11:33.830 --> 05:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:37.750 --> 05:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
members great thank
 
05:11:40.150 --> 05:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
05:11:41.590 --> 05:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh my final
 
05:11:45.350 --> 05:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
card on this bill Nathan
 
05:11:47.510 --> 05:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
Boran from
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:55.548 --> 05:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
sir thank you sir my name is Nathan
 
05:11:57.548 --> 05:11:57.558 align:start position:0%
Borland I am a paramedic currently with
 
05:12:00.788 --> 05:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
Stuart's ambulance uh I have been in Ems
 
05:12:03.990 --> 05:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
for about 25 years uh so Chris has me
 
05:12:05.070 --> 05:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
beat as
 
05:12:07.030 --> 05:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
well uh I started in the state of
 
05:12:09.470 --> 05:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
Vermont where I live uh I started in New
 
05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2010 or 11 as a paramedic
 
05:12:15.708 --> 05:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
um I make the commute down here uh
 
05:12:16.990 --> 05:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
because it's a better work environment
 
05:12:19.030 --> 05:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
for me and it fits better with my
 
05:12:22.390 --> 05:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
schedule uh I have recently obtained my
 
05:12:25.390 --> 05:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
FPC certified flight paramedic so I am
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh certified Critical Care paramedic
 
05:12:28.868 --> 05:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
which is the highest level of service
 
05:12:30.510 --> 05:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
that you can get prehospitally without
 
05:12:32.910 --> 05:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
me going to PA school or medical school
 
05:12:35.708 --> 05:12:35.718 align:start position:0%
and I have no intentions of doing that
 
05:12:37.470 --> 05:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
uh I apologize to you in advance here
 
05:12:39.548 --> 05:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
speaking to you everybody's touched on
 
05:12:41.548 --> 05:12:41.558 align:start position:0%
what I had in my head at this point plus
 
05:12:43.230 --> 05:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
I didn't initially intend to speak to
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
you today I was coming to listen but I
 
05:12:47.670 --> 05:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
felt I can offer you a few pieces of
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
insight that you might not get
 
05:12:54.708 --> 05:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um so balance billing I think
 
05:12:56.868 --> 05:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room is an agreement
 
05:12:59.270 --> 05:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
that balance billing shouldn't happen
 
05:13:02.190 --> 05:13:02.200 align:start position:0%
we've beat this horse to death for many
 
05:13:04.270 --> 05:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
years but we don't have a solution for
 
05:13:06.628 --> 05:13:06.638 align:start position:0%
it because it's a necessary evil to keep
 
05:13:09.670 --> 05:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
ambulance agencies alive at this point
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
none of us like to send a bill to that
 
05:13:13.750 --> 05:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
patient you know when the insurance
 
05:13:16.548 --> 05:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
company has paid uh you know x amount
 
05:13:19.590 --> 05:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
when we've build you know y amount and
 
05:13:22.390 --> 05:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
wait where's this bill coming from uh
 
05:13:24.670 --> 05:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
personally I ran an agency up north as
 
05:13:26.270 --> 05:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
far north as you can get in the state
 
05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
for six years and my practice then was
 
05:13:31.110 --> 05:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
if someone came to me with any kind of a
 
05:13:33.310 --> 05:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
hardship whatsoever I worked out payment
 
05:13:36.548 --> 05:13:36.558 align:start position:0%
plans I helped with hardship cases where
 
05:13:39.150 --> 05:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
okay we'll just write this off uh my
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
experiences up there on average every
 
05:13:44.390 --> 05:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
year we build out about 2.4 million in
 
05:13:46.990 --> 05:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
services and collected around 900 to a
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
million back so there's a big disconnect
 
05:13:52.948 --> 05:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
here in terms of reimbursing and funding
 
05:13:55.230 --> 05:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
and the difficulty of that becomes who
 
05:13:57.750 --> 05:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
picks up that extra cost our cost of
 
05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
service is fixed we have to pay our
 
05:14:02.750 --> 05:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
people uh whether they're on a call or
 
05:14:04.750 --> 05:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
not we have to buy this truck whether
 
05:14:06.430 --> 05:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
it's on a call or not whether the wheels
 
05:14:08.590 --> 05:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
are turning whether it's parked it
 
05:14:11.150 --> 05:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter it costs the same so we
 
05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
have to stay in business in order to be
 
05:14:16.510 --> 05:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
able to provide this service our costs
 
05:14:18.788 --> 05:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
are pretty fixed I mean you have some
 
05:14:20.948 --> 05:14:20.958 align:start position:0%
variability with overtime and you know
 
05:14:23.270 --> 05:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
pandemics and eclipses and the things
 
05:14:25.310 --> 05:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
that cause us to have to add staff at
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
times but for the most part it's
 
05:14:31.750 --> 05:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
fixed uh so balance billing none of us
 
05:14:34.788 --> 05:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
want to do at all but we have to at this
 
05:14:36.430 --> 05:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
point because we have to make up that
 
05:14:38.350 --> 05:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
Gap anywhere that we can you've talked
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
about medic care and Medicaid
 
05:14:41.670 --> 05:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
underfunding those are being addressed
 
05:14:43.390 --> 05:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
elsewhere we have no control over that
 
05:14:45.750 --> 05:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
at this point this is one of the many
 
05:14:47.830 --> 05:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
drops in the bucket that we need to
 
05:14:50.470 --> 05:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
address if you don't do something to
 
05:14:52.150 --> 05:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
change the model
 
05:14:54.350 --> 05:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
soon ambulance agencies are going to
 
05:14:56.030 --> 05:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
continue to fail you've already had
 
05:14:57.548 --> 05:14:57.558 align:start position:0%
several gone out that have gone out of
 
05:15:00.030 --> 05:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
business uh Best Care uh a few years ago
 
05:15:01.830 --> 05:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
went out of business Franconia Life
 
05:15:03.670 --> 05:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
Squad has closed doors and is now being
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
covered by Littleton fire department at
 
05:15:09.150 --> 05:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
a substantially higher cost by the way
 
05:15:11.708 --> 05:15:11.718 align:start position:0%
uh like five or six times the cost of
 
05:15:14.548 --> 05:15:14.558 align:start position:0%
what it cost to maintain frankon Life
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
Squad um you've seen in the papers
 
05:15:19.868 --> 05:15:19.878 align:start position:0%
recently Warren Wentworth EMS um
 
05:15:21.350 --> 05:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
Lynnwood ambulance they're all
 
05:15:23.708 --> 05:15:23.718 align:start position:0%
struggling financially everybody is if
 
05:15:26.430 --> 05:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
you don't do something soon this system
 
05:15:28.350 --> 05:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
is going to continue to fail and then
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
you're going to dial 911 at some point
 
05:15:33.350 --> 05:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
and nobody's going to respond and none
 
05:15:37.670 --> 05:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
of us want that either uh so we need to
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
do something but what's the answer the
 
05:15:42.510 --> 05:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
answer is not setting it at you know
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
196% of Medicare or or whatever this you
 
05:15:47.910 --> 05:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
know proposal has set out and I'll tell
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
you why because in reading that study
 
05:15:51.910 --> 05:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
what when I look through it it said
 
05:15:53.948 --> 05:15:53.958 align:start position:0%
operating costs plus
 
05:15:56.708 --> 05:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
2% so that you know we can pad our
 
05:15:59.470 --> 05:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
budget to survive while in the time
 
05:16:01.270 --> 05:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
frame since this study was released the
 
05:16:03.910 --> 05:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
cost of purchasing a brand new Z cardiac
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
monitor has gone up by 177% not
 
05:16:10.230 --> 05:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
2% the cost of buying a a truck and in
 
05:16:12.548 --> 05:16:12.558 align:start position:0%
February of 22 I ordered an ambulance
 
05:16:14.548 --> 05:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
for the 45th parallel EMS when I was
 
05:16:16.430 --> 05:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
Chief up there we ordered it and locked
 
05:16:18.350 --> 05:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
it in
 
05:16:20.708 --> 05:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
$188,000 when it was delivered to us in
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
April of 24 the sales guy who's a good
 
05:16:27.190 --> 05:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
friend of mine said hey are you sure you
 
05:16:29.310 --> 05:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
want this for this price because I have
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
somebody that just offered me 250,000
 
05:16:34.150 --> 05:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
for it cash site on scene and I can get
 
05:16:36.030 --> 05:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
that easily I'm like nah sorry we have a
 
05:16:38.070 --> 05:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
contract for 188 this is what it's going
 
05:16:40.788 --> 05:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
to be so those prices I mean that's a
 
05:16:44.310 --> 05:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
huge increase from 188 to 240 or 250 all
 
05:16:46.590 --> 05:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
of these costs keep jumping Higher and
 
05:16:48.868 --> 05:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
Higher and Higher and what's our annual
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
inflation at this point where are we
 
05:16:52.310 --> 05:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
where have we been for the last four
 
05:16:56.230 --> 05:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
years so from a human aspect me as a
 
05:16:58.350 --> 05:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
provider with the experience that I have
 
05:16:59.910 --> 05:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
wanting to be able to help you in your
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
time of need next year you're going to
 
05:17:05.868 --> 05:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
give me a 2% raise when inflation is you
 
05:17:08.670 --> 05:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
know four five 6 8% you're not going to
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
keep people in this line of work doing
 
05:17:12.628 --> 05:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
that we're already struggling to keep
 
05:17:15.270 --> 05:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
people employed I know I'm not going to
 
05:17:17.270 --> 05:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
get rich doing this job I do this job
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
because I love it I would just like to
 
05:17:20.948 --> 05:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
not have to work till noon on the day of
 
05:17:23.030 --> 05:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
my funeral if that's possible
 
05:17:25.548 --> 05:17:25.558 align:start position:0%
please um so those are the kinds of
 
05:17:28.670 --> 05:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
things that we're dealing with um I'll
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions for you
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
uh user had a good question for me I'd
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
like to address uh initially when you
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
were asking about adest Staters the area
 
05:17:39.830 --> 05:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
that I covered up north uh was a lot of
 
05:17:42.990 --> 05:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
Tourism snowmobilers and the like and
 
05:17:45.548 --> 05:17:45.558 align:start position:0%
the answer to that is you take what you
 
05:17:47.510 --> 05:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
get and you're expecting that you're
 
05:17:48.670 --> 05:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
going to have to write the rest of it
 
05:17:50.990 --> 05:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
off for the most part because you just
 
05:17:53.548 --> 05:17:53.558 align:start position:0%
have no Avenue to pursue you can call
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies and try to get
 
05:17:57.110 --> 05:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
more and you get put on hold for 45
 
05:17:58.510 --> 05:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
minutes to an hour and then someone
 
05:17:59.948 --> 05:17:59.958 align:start position:0%
picks up the phone and oh we're
 
05:18:01.830 --> 05:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
disconnected accidentally so you start
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
the process over so we never get
 
05:18:06.948 --> 05:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
anywhere ambulance agencies as your
 
05:18:09.910 --> 05:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
small you know little either private or
 
05:18:12.670 --> 05:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
municipal or nonprofit agency do not
 
05:18:15.270 --> 05:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
have the same bargaining power that a
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
Nationwide Insurance company does so to
 
05:18:19.708 --> 05:18:19.718 align:start position:0%
try to litigate and go after we can't
 
05:18:21.190 --> 05:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
compete with their lawyers it's not
 
05:18:23.270 --> 05:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
possible therefore you take what they
 
05:18:25.910 --> 05:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
give you and either the taxpayer picks
 
05:18:28.510 --> 05:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
up the bill or you write it off and you
 
05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
know as as the chief said you're faced
 
05:18:32.350 --> 05:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
with do we go to the taxpayers for more
 
05:18:35.628 --> 05:18:35.638 align:start position:0%
money or do we cut Services uh and I can
 
05:18:37.750 --> 05:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
tell you that a lot of your rural areas
 
05:18:39.470 --> 05:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
especially the further North you go the
 
05:18:41.548 --> 05:18:41.558 align:start position:0%
worse it gets they're already paying
 
05:18:44.548 --> 05:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
exorbitant property taxes to maintain
 
05:18:44.558 --> 05:18:45.310 align:start position:0%
exorbitant property taxes to maintain
your

05:18:45.310 --> 05:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:18:48.548 --> 05:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
services so do you want to save you know
 
05:18:50.230 --> 05:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of dollars in premium on a
 
05:18:52.110 --> 05:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
healthare plan or do you want to pay an
 
05:18:54.788 --> 05:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
extra $5,000 a year in property tax on
 
05:18:56.510 --> 05:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
your house that you own that's the
 
05:18:58.628 --> 05:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
question you're going to have to address
 
05:19:01.190 --> 05:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
and it does need to be fixed and fixed
 
05:19:01.200 --> 05:19:02.390 align:start position:0%
and it does need to be fixed and fixed
relatively

05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
quickly so I will certainly take any
 
05:19:07.510 --> 05:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
questions that you have uh and again I
 
05:19:09.190 --> 05:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
apologize for kind of being off the cuff
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:18.310 --> 05:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
today thank you um representative Gibbs
 
05:19:21.310 --> 05:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
remember with this is still going to
 
05:19:24.868 --> 05:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative
 
05:19:28.270 --> 05:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:19:30.830 --> 05:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
for coming in and representing um
 
05:19:33.788 --> 05:19:33.798 align:start position:0%
providing us with your information
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
um the discussion of the PCG report
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
stated that the proposed rate would be
 
05:19:44.230 --> 05:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
about double or several people have said
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
197% of the current in rate of insurance
 
05:19:51.150 --> 05:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
payment um one of the earlier
 
05:19:53.868 --> 05:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
representatives of the providers stated
 
05:19:56.190 --> 05:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
that several other states have enacted
 
05:19:59.590 --> 05:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
rate schedules that provide for three
 
05:20:04.948 --> 05:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
325 per of Medicare do you have an idea
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
of what rate level
 
05:20:10.310 --> 05:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
would make make it possible for
 
05:20:14.150 --> 05:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
ambulance services to continue um in a
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable Financial
 
05:20:19.190 --> 05:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
way I can't speak for any of the other
 
05:20:21.788 --> 05:20:21.798 align:start position:0%
services but last year when we were
 
05:20:23.590 --> 05:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
talking about this and Senator
 
05:20:25.990 --> 05:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
Apprentice had the bill for 325 per of
 
05:20:27.868 --> 05:20:27.878 align:start position:0%
Medicare I went back to my office in
 
05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
colbrook and I analyzed those numbers
 
05:20:33.670 --> 05:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
and realized that that was feasible for
 
05:20:36.310 --> 05:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
us at that time uh I would have to look
 
05:20:38.230 --> 05:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
at it again I've been out of that office
 
05:20:40.430 --> 05:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
now for for about 6 months uh I'd have
 
05:20:42.750 --> 05:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
to look at it again to make sure but at
 
05:20:45.628 --> 05:20:45.638 align:start position:0%
that time looking at the numbers 325 of
 
05:20:47.910 --> 05:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare was going to be sustainable for
 
05:20:51.990 --> 05:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
us so if the rate set by the commission
 
05:20:57.628 --> 05:20:57.638 align:start position:0%
was 325 per of Medicare rather than 197%
 
05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
of current insurance rates um you think
 
05:21:02.948 --> 05:21:02.958 align:start position:0%
that that would be sustainable for your
 
05:21:04.990 --> 05:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
organization for the numbers I look at
 
05:21:06.708 --> 05:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
at the time absolutely that would have
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:13.830 --> 05:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative miles thank you thank you
 
05:21:16.070 --> 05:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
for coming um I just want to try to put
 
05:21:17.510 --> 05:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
this in perspective a bit so I'm going
 
05:21:19.270 --> 05:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
to use the reference the New Hampshire
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
Association of Fire Chiefs passed out so
 
05:21:23.830 --> 05:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
05:21:28.110 --> 05:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
rate would be for ALS life support
 
05:21:31.590 --> 05:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
emergency run it says
 
05:21:33.948 --> 05:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
$1,105 I I know you don't have a stack
 
05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
of papers in front of you so I don't
 
05:21:40.030 --> 05:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
expect exact numbers so 11 $100 if you
 
05:21:41.990 --> 05:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
were to go to your ambulance run sheet
 
05:21:44.310 --> 05:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
your electronic run sheet check off one
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
of everything maybe two two liters of
 
05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
saline two vials of this two vials of
 
05:21:51.030 --> 05:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
that your gloves your compression bands
 
05:21:53.270 --> 05:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
for your automated compression device
 
05:21:54.510 --> 05:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
one of
 
05:21:57.750 --> 05:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
everything wouldn't that be more than
 
05:22:00.310 --> 05:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
$1,100 that is the bane of the existence
 
05:22:02.670 --> 05:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
of ambulance billing right there uh
 
05:22:04.948 --> 05:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
years and years ago we used to be able
 
05:22:08.150 --> 05:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
to build itemized billing based on what
 
05:22:11.030 --> 05:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
we used used we are now lumped into
 
05:22:15.430 --> 05:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
these you know als1 als2 BLS rates that
 
05:22:17.150 --> 05:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
if you provide this level of service
 
05:22:19.788 --> 05:22:19.798 align:start position:0%
it's x amount of dollars the problem
 
05:22:22.628 --> 05:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
with that is an als1 call could simply
 
05:22:24.548 --> 05:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
be you needed a cardiac Monitor and I
 
05:22:27.110 --> 05:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
started an IV on you and so here's you
 
05:22:30.548 --> 05:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
know $1,100 for this service but that
 
05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
same ALS billing rate um years ago when
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
it first came out am odone was around uh
 
05:22:39.070 --> 05:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
if I remember right $300 a milligram
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
so it was an expensive drug and we're
 
05:22:43.510 --> 05:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
getting the same 1,00 bucks for that you
 
05:22:44.948 --> 05:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
know administering that drug it's come
 
05:22:47.670 --> 05:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
down in price recently but I mean there
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
are meds out there that are ungodly
 
05:22:51.628 --> 05:22:51.638 align:start position:0%
expensive and we get the same
 
05:22:54.948 --> 05:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
reimbursement no matter what so yes
 
05:22:57.830 --> 05:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's a very valid point thank you
 
05:22:57.840 --> 05:22:58.990 align:start position:0%
that's a very valid point thank you
appreciate

05:22:58.990 --> 05:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
05:23:03.390 --> 05:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
that okay representative last question
 
05:23:06.110 --> 05:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
so uh well thanks for a question taking
 
05:23:09.190 --> 05:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
my question I I I just want to know that
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
in the current system where you have
 
05:23:10.400 --> 05:23:11.310 align:start position:0%
in the current system where you have
balance

05:23:11.310 --> 05:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
balance
 
05:23:14.910 --> 05:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
billing are you not getting paid most of
 
05:23:17.070 --> 05:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
the time or are you getting paid by the
 
05:23:21.390 --> 05:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
consumer at this moment it varies a lot
 
05:23:22.788 --> 05:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
depending on the person that you're
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with the insurance company that
 
05:23:27.990 --> 05:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with um the re my
 
05:23:29.470 --> 05:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
personal experience with getting
 
05:23:31.590 --> 05:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from balance billing
 
05:23:34.750 --> 05:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
patients was about 40% collection rate
 
05:23:37.390 --> 05:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh it varies from service to service and
 
05:23:40.310 --> 05:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
area to area some people that don't care
 
05:23:42.030 --> 05:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
about their credit rating at all they
 
05:23:43.548 --> 05:23:43.558 align:start position:0%
just throw the bill away and that's the
 
05:23:46.510 --> 05:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
end of it other people I I had one young
 
05:23:47.990 --> 05:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
gentleman that wrecked a snowmobile in
 
05:23:51.030 --> 05:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
2015 and sent me $5 a week for about 12
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
years to pay his bill off so there's so
 
05:23:55.430 --> 05:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
much variability there I can't give you
 
05:23:57.628 --> 05:23:57.638 align:start position:0%
a solid answer so just just to follow up
 
05:23:59.628 --> 05:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
so the current system of balance Bing is
 
05:24:01.470 --> 05:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
not solving your financial problem is it
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
correct no but if you take it away from
 
05:24:06.070 --> 05:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
us without fixing everything else it's
 
05:24:09.628 --> 05:24:09.638 align:start position:0%
going to worsen things
 
05:24:09.638 --> 05:24:10.430 align:start position:0%
going to worsen things
thank

05:24:10.430 --> 05:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:24:14.830 --> 05:24:14.840 align:start position:0%

05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:25.990 --> 05:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:27.830 --> 05:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh get through this final
 
05:30:27.840 --> 05:30:28.750 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh get through this final
bill

05:30:28.750 --> 05:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:30:32.230 --> 05:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
here uh House Bill
 
05:30:38.788 --> 05:30:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:42.390 --> 05:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
actually just take a seat over here I
 
05:30:43.830 --> 05:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
need someone to introduce the bill
 
05:30:46.390 --> 05:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
because I don't see representative
 
05:30:51.390 --> 05:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:55.350 --> 05:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
here all right I won't bother no problem
 
05:30:58.708 --> 05:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
uh you ready okay Chris you're the only
 
05:31:00.670 --> 05:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
one has a card in so tell us why you
 
05:31:02.868 --> 05:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
want this
 
05:31:06.110 --> 05:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
bill tell us what's better about this
 
05:31:09.948 --> 05:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
bill well in in um thank you for the
 
05:31:11.230 --> 05:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I won't repeat
 
05:31:13.868 --> 05:31:13.878 align:start position:0%
everything I said already uh this bill
 
05:31:18.390 --> 05:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
as I understand it um looks at paying or
 
05:31:20.470 --> 05:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
compelling the insurance carriers to pay
 
05:31:23.788 --> 05:31:23.798 align:start position:0%
at whatever rate the community sets so
 
05:31:26.868 --> 05:31:26.878 align:start position:0%
if you're in chrisville and all the
 
05:31:30.150 --> 05:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
Selectmen get together and say we think
 
05:31:32.750 --> 05:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
our cost is $1,000 for an ambulance ride
 
05:31:34.590 --> 05:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
that's what they set the rate at that's
 
05:31:37.590 --> 05:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
the amount that this bill would require
 
05:31:40.628 --> 05:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
the commercial insurance carriers to pay
 
05:31:45.070 --> 05:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
so short of a percentage of Medicare we
 
05:31:47.310 --> 05:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a a very good idea
 
05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
that being said there's a number of
 
05:31:51.270 --> 05:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
things in the bill that I don't think
 
05:31:53.910 --> 05:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
are clear and would have to be cleared
 
05:31:57.990 --> 05:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
up prior to the bill moving forward um
 
05:32:01.150 --> 05:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
and I will Echo what the insurance
 
05:32:03.708 --> 05:32:03.718 align:start position:0%
department came up with for their
 
05:32:06.310 --> 05:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
concerns with in the lot part or the
 
05:32:08.430 --> 05:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
analysis of the bill there's a lot of
 
05:32:11.708 --> 05:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
things that just are not spelled out so
 
05:32:13.510 --> 05:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
the concept of the bill is great but we
 
05:32:15.470 --> 05:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
can't support it as it's currently
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
written no this one you say you like
 
05:32:20.830 --> 05:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
this is 185 correct yeah we say we say
 
05:32:22.990 --> 05:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
we like it because the theory behind it
 
05:32:25.788 --> 05:32:25.798 align:start position:0%
is that it compels the insurers to pay
 
05:32:27.750 --> 05:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
at whatever rate the elected officials
 
05:32:29.708 --> 05:32:29.718 align:start position:0%
in the community the service I see Bill
 
05:32:32.270 --> 05:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
at all I think you got the wrong
 
05:32:34.430 --> 05:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
Bill Insurance should provide
 
05:32:36.590 --> 05:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates negotiate between
 
05:32:38.510 --> 05:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
the insurer and the the ambulance
 
05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
service provider yep in the absence of
 
05:32:42.948 --> 05:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
the agreed rate an insurer shall pay the
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
amount build by the ambulance service
 
05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:51.070 --> 05:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
service right oh this is oh this is any
 
05:32:53.590 --> 05:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
willing provider right so that that that
 
05:32:55.750 --> 05:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
that the insurance insurance company has
 
05:32:58.150 --> 05:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
to pay whatever you Bill them correct
 
05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah what's that got to do with the
 
05:33:01.510 --> 05:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
local people that that part about you
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
said had something to do with local but
 
05:33:06.190 --> 05:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
but because the way the process works is
 
05:33:08.470 --> 05:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
localities set those rates
 
05:33:10.628 --> 05:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
what what your community charges for an
 
05:33:12.548 --> 05:33:12.558 align:start position:0%
ambulance and what my community charges
 
05:33:14.190 --> 05:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
for an ambulance are not the same thing
 
05:33:17.390 --> 05:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
our costs are different right so this
 
05:33:18.750 --> 05:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
05:33:21.150 --> 05:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
require the insurers to pay whatever
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
that amount was whatever you determined
 
05:33:25.190 --> 05:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
it cost you this thing about the local
 
05:33:27.070 --> 05:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
people being involved but I I didn't
 
05:33:30.070 --> 05:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
understand sorry you you were not saying
 
05:33:32.788 --> 05:33:32.798 align:start position:0%
that the my selectman will set the rate
 
05:33:32.798 --> 05:33:34.230 align:start position:0%
that the my selectman will set the rate
well

05:33:34.230 --> 05:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:33:38.190 --> 05:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
that's is that it's the yeah
 
05:33:40.510 --> 05:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
so whatever you got built yes any
 
05:33:43.510 --> 05:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
willing provider correct that's all I
 
05:33:46.270 --> 05:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
you uh any questions from the committee
 
05:33:53.910 --> 05:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
members who okay we're done is there
 
05:33:55.470 --> 05:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
anybody else who would like to testify
 
05:33:59.670 --> 05:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:03.910 --> 05:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:08.548 --> 05:34:08.558 align:start position:0%
185 I think everybody's exhausted on
 
05:34:11.510 --> 05:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
the issue okay so uh for the committee
 
05:34:13.910 --> 05:34:13.920 align:start position:0%

Thursdays Thursdays obviously is
 
05:36:35.830 --> 05:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
problematic because we could have
 
05:36:39.230 --> 05:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
sessions so and and and I will be damned
 
05:36:41.830 --> 05:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
if I'm going to come in on Fridays no
 
05:36:45.990 --> 05:36:46.000 align:start position:0%

you know down
 
05:36:56.310 --> 05:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
