of the committee happy crossover week uh
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Grant bossy Deputy Chief of
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
Staff to the New Hampshire Senate and
 
00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce Senate Bill 355 on
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
behalf of Senator Dan Enis the Bill's
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor cyto megavirus or CMV is
 
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 align:start position:0%
known as the stealth virus you may have
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
never heard of it but it's actually
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
quite common in fact many of us may be
 
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
infected with CMV and never even know it
 
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
that's because for most healthy people
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
CMV has no symptoms most of them will
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
never develop symptoms if you've got a
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
compromised immune system though CMV can
 
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 align:start position:0%
be very serious in fact it's the most
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
common cause of hearing loss in children
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
it can also lead to blindness
 
00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities cerebal paly
 
00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
and epilepsy this leaves pregnant women
 
00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
and their babies most at risk one in
 
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
every 200 babies will be born with CMV
 
00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
the baby usually doesn't show any
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
obvious symptoms but they can develop
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
serious health problems months or even
 
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
years after birth knowing that a newborn
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
has CMV can make a world of difference
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
should they develop those problems they
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
can be given antiviral medications and
 
00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:42.759 align:start position:0%
more frequent hearing and vision tests
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
SB 355 as amended by the Senate would
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
direct the Department of Health and
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
Human Services to provide information on
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
the importance of early detection of CMV
 
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
to the newborn screening program under
 
00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.150 align:start position:0%
to the newborn screening program under
RSA

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
13210 warning parents to be wary of CMV
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
symptoms addition it would require DHHS
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
to update the HHS oversight committee on
 
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
targeted newborn screening for CMV we
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
know the RIS of cnv to our newest
 
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters knowing an infection is
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
present can give parents and their
 
00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
doctors the advanced warning they need
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
to provide timely and effective
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
treatment I would defer questions people
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
with more medical knowledge than I
 
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 align:start position:0%

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
355 and I'm happy to take
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lon um thank
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
Broadley for being here this morning uh
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
my question is how are infants screened
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
for CMV so my understanding is when um
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
newborns are screened for hearing
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
um they have a hearing screening um and
 
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
if that screening is positive for
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
hearing loss um then our uh member
 
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
Hospital our birthing hospitals would um
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
screen for CMV but I also think that
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
there are other experts who may have
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
some additional insight into what the
 
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
requirements are for screening of CMV
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
and how um we can try to track it
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
early I have a follow sure followup um
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and as a followup um would it
 
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
be possible to share what you actually
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
I'll go to the the hearing reports from
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate to see what your concern was
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
that it was removed so thank you thanks
 
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.910 align:start position:0%
that it was removed so thank you thanks
other

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you um is it possible that
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns were resolved by
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
changing this from requiring the
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
screening which is how I assume the bill
 
00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
came in yes um to um Pro providing more
 
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
information and and some protocols yeah
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
among other things I would say that that
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
was our um main concern uh you know the
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
advisory committee for these um
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
screening panels has been the
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
traditional mechanism for determining
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
what would be appropriate to include and
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
not include um and so we felt that um it
 
00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:47.959 align:start position:0%
was most appropriate for that mechanism
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee to be making
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
those determinations rather than the
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
legislature trying to come up with a um
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
specified process or requirement in
 
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.150 align:start position:0%
specified process or requirement in
statute

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%

other
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none oh representative

not thank you for taking my question um
 
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
is there an estimate of how many
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
children go DEA because they have this
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
know I don't have those numbers but
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
there may be some other experts
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere there exist those yes I'm
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
quite sure I'll bar them out thank you
 
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.189 align:start position:0%

355 relative to newborn screening for
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
cyto Migo virus or CMV I would like to
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
thank senator inis for bringing
 
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
attention and awareness of CMV through
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation the department is in
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
support of the bill as amended by the
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
Senate uh the Department's newborn
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
screening program is responsible for
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
assuring all infants born in New
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are screened for 37 heritable
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
disorders clinical congenital heart
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
defects in newborn hearing the goal of
 
00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:40.829 align:start position:0%
defects in newborn hearing the goal of
newborn

00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
newborn
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
screening is early identification for
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
timely treatment and
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
intervention as mentioned before CMV is
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
the most common infectious birth effect
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
in the United States um infants born
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
with CMV which is one in five will have
 
00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:55.759 align:start position:0%
long-term health problems such as
 
00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
hearing loss Developmental and motor
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
delay delay loss micro micral and
 
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
seizures um and CMV is transmitted to
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
the fetus during
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
pregnancy um C 355 would direct the
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
newborn screening program to increase
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
awareness of CMV for expecting parents
 
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
awareness of CMV for expecting parents
and

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
providers um it would provide technical
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
assistance to hospitals who
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
independently and voluntarily conduct
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
targeted screening for cnv using urine
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
or saliva there's four hospitals that
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
currently do this
 
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
um and lastly the department will be
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
required to report its efforts on
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
increasing awareness education and
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
targeted CMV screening as part of the
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
program's annual report and there is no
 
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact to the department I want
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
to say thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
provide testimony today and I'd be happy
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you if you know and feel
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
free to say you don't if you don't um do
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
you have any sight as to why the newborn
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
screening um the committee that that
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
looks at these have determined not to
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
include this with the other ones so this
 
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
test is best conducted from the year in
 
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
the saliva of the infant so the blood
 
00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
spot test is which I think you're
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
referring to it's not the best method
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
for testing for
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
sing so that 37 heritable disorders
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
that's using the blood so the would be
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
tested using urine and saliva for CMV so
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
so they're already may I follow sure
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
follow I'm I'm just remembering any
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
number of other bills that we've heard
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
in this committee where there is a
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
particular condition that somebody wants
 
00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839 align:start position:0%
to have added to the panel of tests that
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
are done and we have tried to refer
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
people to the newborn screening panel
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
and they've said well went there and
 
00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
they said no and I I'm trying to find
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
out what the status is with this within
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
the panel and and and
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
how if if screening is already done
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
under what hospices I get it am I right
 
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
in thinking it's entirely voluntary at
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
this time yes okay so hospitals
 
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
voluntarily do this so it is not so
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
there's a recommended uniform screening
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
panel okay it that's what I was talking
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
about yeah okay it has not been approved
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
by that yet okay so New Hampshire has
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
not even entertained this conversation
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
because we go based on what is
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
recommended recommended by this
 
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
recommended uniform screening panel at
 
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.350 align:start position:0%
recommended uniform screening panel at
the

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
time our representative chapero thank
 
00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman if you would indulge my
 
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
ignorance about the um new board
 
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
screening program what does the newborn
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
screening program actually do do they
 
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
actually do screenings or do they
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
provide information to other medical
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
providers who do screening so the
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
newborn screening program is comprised
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
of blood spot so they do test infants
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
for 37 heritable
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
disorders yep all infants sorry um uh
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
newborn hearing screening so we test
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
every babies's for hearing and then
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
critical congenital heart defects so we
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
test all babies for that and this is
 
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
done within the 48 72 hours after
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
birth where where does that get done at
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
the hospital okay so the DHHS through
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
this program does it
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
at at at the hospitals yep okay so the
 
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals conduct all the screenings and
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
then they report to us okay the result
 
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
okay that's Rel true thank you very much
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
y representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
and being able to provide information if
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
a child is found to have CMV how does
 
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
the treatment of that child change based
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosis I can't answer that entirely
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
but I can answer a part of that so there
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
is Treatment available for infants with
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
CMV it's going to be specific on the
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
child and the provider what they
 
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
recommend okay as a followup follow up
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
so as a followup um I it sounds like
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
there's antivirals um if it's possible
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
to find out the number of children
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
needed to treat with those antivirals to
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
prevent a problem we just want to make
 
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
sure that children aren't overtreated
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
for something that may not cause
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
problems so if it's possible to get a
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
follow up on that I'd appreciate it yes
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
and I will say that children who are
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic typically aren't treated so
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
there has to be present
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
symptoms follow sorry and one more
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
followup so if a child develops shows
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
symptoms of one of the of CMV there are
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
they already tested for CMV if they show
 
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
symptoms it depends on at the hospital
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
level if they choose to test them or not
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
so there are four hospitals that do test
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
for CMV B based on hearing uh failing
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
the hearing screening the second time um
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
for those who are in more critical
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
condition the nicku uh Special Care
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
nurseries can test for cnv on their
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
own I can one more follow follow sorry
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
no this it is complex and that's why I
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
didn't want to ask a really big
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
complicated question do you know if
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
that's already in the guidelines that
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
are required for required for the
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
hospitals to follow for the joint
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
accreditation and everything else to be
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
licensed as a hospital so that if a
 
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
child shows those symptoms they need to
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
be screened for SE that would cause that
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know that answer I'll follow up
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
on that thank you other
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
questions saying none okay thank you
 
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.149 align:start position:0%
questions saying none okay thank you
thank

00:19:45.149 --> 00:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Elizabeth
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
triny hi good morning chairman and
 
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
McDonald uh members of the committee my
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
name is Elizabeth Sergeant I'm here from
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
shampan Capital group um a government
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
relations firm here in conquered and I'm
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
here to testify in support of the bill
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Academy of
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
ideology uh Carolyn jury is the
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
president she couldn't appear before you
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
but she has submitted written testimony
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
that is coming around um I'll just I
 
00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039 align:start position:0%
won't read her testimony but uh we'll
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
just highlight um a couple of points CMV
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
is a common virus that often causes no
 
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
or few mild symptoms in adults and is
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
generally not well known um according to
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
CDC surveys only one in 10 women of
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
childbearing age have ever even heard of
 
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
it however if a woman contracts the
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
virus during her pregnancy it can have
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
lifelong serious problems for her child
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
most children known to have CMV at Birth
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
do not show any symptoms four out of
 
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
five show none and then so I'll um and
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
then she talks about infants who do show
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
symptomss are at a higher risk for
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
developing intellectual disability
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
language delays poor physical
 
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
coordination weakness hearing loss in
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
either one or both ears or seizures and
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
then she goes on to say the benefits of
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
very early ID
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
identification um can go a long way to
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
help the child's development progress in
 
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
the areas of need um and in closing so
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
she asked that the bill ought to pass I
 
00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:28.039 align:start position:0%
will say representative Lon an answer to
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
your question and I looked through my
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
folder she adjusted her testimony last
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
night based on the bill as amended in
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
her original testimony which we'll send
 
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
to the committee and also she could be
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
available to answer any questions we
 
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
were thinking based on how it got
 
00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
amended that um she didn't uh need to
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
come in person but she did
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
say um congenital CMV cause sensory
 
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
nuring hearing losses also unpredictable
 
00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
in its course is a progressive loss that
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
worson over over time this can happen
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
very quickly mild to profound profound
 
00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
HL in 2 years not be present at birth
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
but show a delayed onset which can occur
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
anytime generally within the first seven
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
years Andor the loss can continue to
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
worsen slowly through the Adolescent
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
years in order to confirm the virus's
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
presence the screening must be within
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
the first two to three weeks of birth by
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
collecting a urine sample like you heard
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
once identified Physicians can treat the
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
virus to to potentially reduce the
 
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
severity of any residual conditions
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
again underscoring the need for early
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
identification and monitoring so I will
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
submit she's got some more details that
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
might answer your question better we'll
 
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
submit this original testimony as well
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
and I may not be able to answer
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions but I can get them to Caroline
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Lon um thank
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you so much
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
for proactively answering that um if you
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
could have her get back to us with
 
00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:57.799 align:start position:0%
information about I see that she says
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
that these would be reasonable First
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
Steps in the process I'd like to know
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
what the rest of the steps are in the
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
process and I'd like to understand um
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
what the treatment would be for a child
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
who is diagnosed with this because um
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
and what the consequences are from that
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
process yeah that sounds great and she's
 
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
listening in so we'll have her formulate
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
a written answer to the committee
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
fantastic thank you thank you
 
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.710 align:start position:0%
fantastic thank you thank you
representative

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
not also I'm curious to see how many
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
children have been affected okay great
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll numbers to go along with okay
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
Weber one further statistic that I'd
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
like to see based on the other two
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
inquiries is the number of children
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
infected and then the number of children
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
symptomatic okay great because it sounds
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
to me like there's a huge difference in
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
that me too that way we'll have the
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
whole Spectrum going around thank
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
you um thank you and um within that
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
similar to the number who are
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
symptomatic if she knows the number
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
needed to treat to prevent the hearing
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
loss that would be
 
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
helpful it thank you other
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
much I have my homework thank you no one
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
else has signed up to testify does
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to testify in this
 
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
fill representative of mapo can you tell
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
us on the blue sheet how many signed up
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
in favor and
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
opposed it's sorry to do that to you but

Senate also meeting right now for the
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
record my name is Becky Whitley and I'm
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
honored to serve New Hampshire Senate
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
District 15 which includes the wonderful
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
communities of conquered Bo Penacook and
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
hopkington this morning I have SB 349
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
for your
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
consideration just as a little bit of
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
background the contents of this bill
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
were actually included in the New
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire mom nibus last year um this is
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
a bill uh it was s SP 175 last year the
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
Senate passed that bill unanimously as
 
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
is our practice then we tabled it for
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
inclusion into the budget into hp1 uh
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
and hb2 however it got lost this portion
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
got lost in the shuffle and it did not
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
make it in into hb2 inadvertently so
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
very simply this bill simply adds a duty
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
to the existing wellness and primary
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
prevention Council that has been created
 
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
by this legislature and what it does is
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
asks them to study how New Hampshire can
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
reduce barriers improve access and
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
create a system of voluntary access to
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
uh home visiting so this committee may
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
know from years past the legislature has
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
discussed the benefits of Home visiting
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's something that we've expanded
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
access to in the medic program I will
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
let the folks behind me talk about this
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
service and how important it is to new
 
00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
families um but just briefly we know
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
that uh the service has really proven to
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh improve lives and improve health
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
outcomes it's also been shown to pay for
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
itself financially over time and reduced
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
health education and criminal justice
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
costs uh as this committee may know well
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
currently only those eligible for New
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid have reliable access
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
to home visiting I will say I had my
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
baby 10 plus years ago at uh conquered
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
hospital and I did have access to home
 
00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
visiting and it was a game Cher I I feel
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
lucky that I have a lot of resources
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
available to me a very supportive family
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
I was healthy my baby was healthy yet
 
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
home visiting was uh an incredible
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
resource that I um had about a week
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
after I gave birth my son um had a
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
tongue tie he was having trouble nursing
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
of course that's terrifying for new moms
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
if you can all go back to that feeling
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
the mom's in the room home visitor the
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
home visitor came uh she took care of my
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
son she took care of me um and I will
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
never forget that visit um in my pajamas
 
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
about a week after giving birth at home
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
so um this bill would allow the existing
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
wellness and PR and primary prevention
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
Council uh Who members are here can tell
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
you their work but it's an existing
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
Council that does a lot of great work um
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
and it will allow them to sort of study
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
what are the barriers right now to more
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
moms accessing this service how do we
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
improve access and how do we create a
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
system so that more more parents of of
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
newborns uh can get this critical
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
service I respectfully ask the committee
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
to support SB 349 I'm happy to take any
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
questions but there are folks from the
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
wellness and primary prevention Council
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
who can speak to their work and also uh
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
speak to home visiting in more detail
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative Leon
 
00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:47.559 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
senator wetley for being here with us um
 
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
I also had that same crisis too my
 
00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:54.519 align:start position:0%
crisis was at 11 o'clock at night and
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
the monthly lche meeting was in town the
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
next day so that was thank I appreciate
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
all of this um my question is more to
 
00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
you because you deal with more the
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
limited resources and the choices we
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
have to make in the legislature than um
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
than this Council needs to with our
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
shortage of uh medical and Healthcare
 
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
Providers how does this filter into the
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
fact that we're just trying to make sure
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
that we have the providers available at
 
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519 align:start position:0%
our at our facilities in order to see
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
patients see families see babies which
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
is done in a much more time efficient
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
way when the families are coming to them
 
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
and how do we look at those resources
 
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
when we're expecting them to travel from
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
home to home and um deal with that in in
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
our in our current issue of Workforce
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question it's a
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
real problem our perinatal Workforce is
 
00:29:43.509 --> 00:29:43.519 align:start position:0%
strapped part of the New Hampshire
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
Omnibus was to take a holistic look at
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
the perinatal Workforce but it's a real
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
problem and so I think those issues that
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
I that you have identified Workforce
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
barriers Insurance barriers other
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
barriers that's exactly what this bill
 
00:29:58.269 --> 00:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
is intended to address and have this the
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
group that really knows best to study it
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
I know that you all are on many study
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
committees as am I um we really felt
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
like um at this point uh we need the
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
experts who are working in the field to
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
sort of study through and look through
 
00:30:13.509 --> 00:30:13.519 align:start position:0%
and identify these barriers and then
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
come back to the legislature to provide
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
some recommendations that's what this
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
Council already does they're already
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
designated to look at those prevention
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
strategies and come back to the
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
legislature um and so they were a good
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh it was actually at the suggestion of
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
the Senate President to have them
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
continue to do that work thank
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%

coordination and service to the state of
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for over 25 years Not Me
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
Myself And um the goal really is to
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
support a system of primary prevention
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and as part of the
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
outline duties the wellness and primary
 
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:06.440 align:start position:0%
prevention council is charged to look at
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
how we can improve the system make
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations around funding and look
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
at barriers and
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies I want to um underscore
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
that what is outlined in Senate Bill 349
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
we have done before actually in 2017 the
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
W PPC was led by Senator um I mean
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
representative John fathergill who
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
proposed um with former represent
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative skip Baran a bill that
 
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
would charge the wppc to look at how we
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
could strengthen Family Resource Centers
 
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
so over the course of the year a number
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
of years recommendations were made to
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
this legislature and now we have a
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
facilitating organization and last year
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
in a bipartisan effort this legislature
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
um uh appropriated historic funding to
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
the system because it's been efficient
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
so I think when we look at primary
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
prevention Family Resource Centers are
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
important but also for maternal Health
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
how are we helping our new moms and
 
00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
babies and home visiting is a really key
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
aspect to that and I'm representative
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
lay on your question about how does this
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
um impact efficiencies or helping you
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
know with regard to hospitals we know we
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
have a um uh lack of access to maternal
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
Healthcare in rural areas so
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
understanding how home visiting can help
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
or reduce barriers is really important
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
for our state so I'll just emphasize
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
that the wppc has been here for a long
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
time um we are a well organized and
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
equipped body to take this question
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
study it and provide back to the
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
legislature a number of recommendations
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
so we hope that you will consider this
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
bill and urge you ought to pass and I'm
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
voluntary home visiting is meant to
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
convey that it's up to the parents
 
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:07.639 align:start position:0%

experience and having a a little one
 
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
myself I can tell you that those very
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
first moments with your new baby are
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
some of the most exciting they're full
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
of a lot of first that first breath that
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
first smile eventually that first step
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
but at the same time they're truly some
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
of the most terrifying even when you
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
read all the books of what to expect
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
supporting new moms and birthing people
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%

parent child relationships as you've
 
00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
heard my colleague say home visiting is
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
an effective tool that ensures that
 
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
families with young children have access
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
to the support that they need to build a
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
strong foundation in life for well-being
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
and success trained professionals work
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
with the family to grow parenting skills
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
create social support systems and
 
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
connect them to other resources these
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
personalized supports meet families
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
literally where they're at by meeting
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
them in the home which helps reduce
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
barriers to participation such as
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
transportation and child care which we
 
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
know in a state like ours can be very
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
challenging um this comprehensive
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
approach helps create healthier moms and
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
babies stronger parent child bonds lower
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
rates of child abuse and neglect more
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
positive parenting practices earlier
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
development of language and literacy
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
skills and improved School Readiness
 
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
safer homes and increased rates of
 
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.230 align:start position:0%
safer homes and increased rates of
Parental

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
Parental
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
employment as Senator Whitley mentioned
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
um there are studies that have shown
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
that home visiting it can yield
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
significant return on adment um anywhere
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
between a80 to $5.70 for every dollar
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
spent by intervening early and
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
preventing costly problems down the road
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
um home visiting is a fin financially
 
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
and fiscally smart decision we do use
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid dollars to fund some folks
 
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
access as representative king um
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
questioned earlier um to home visiting
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
through the Medicaid Program in 2021 my
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
data might be a little old here but we
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
estimate that we served about 6.5%
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
children under three with um eligible
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
incomes So Below 150% of the federal
 
00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:04.119 align:start position:0%
poverty level who would have been
 
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
eligible and that figure Falls below the
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
national average of about 8% of eligible
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
children in the Medicaid Program having
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
access to home visiting um overall
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
though in the state only 1% of zero to
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
two year olds in New Hampshire um
 
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
receive a home visit from a home visitor
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
I've included in my testimony a story
 
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
from a member from sutt New Hampshire
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
which emphasizes um how valuable home
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
visiting was for her and her medically
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
complicated um preey who came home when
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
her husband was away at work um she
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
details how without this she may not
 
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
have survived so iure I hope that you'll
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and um just let you
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
know that Mom's Rising is proud to
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
support senel 349 as a piece of the
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
Omnibus that we passed last year and
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
some great work that we did on maternal
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
Health um we should be doing everything
 
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
everything we can to make sure that moms
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
and babies have a healthy start in life
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
and so we ask for your support for
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 349 and I'm happy to take
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for coming here
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
um when you were referencing the meeting
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
this morning um I'm I'm curious how
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
these home visits intersect with child
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
abuse definitely so part of Home
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
visiting is par positive parenting skill
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
building um so getting to families in
 
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
some of those very vulnerable first
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
moments as parents um
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
is really critically important for
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
teaching parents what to expect um how
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
to deal with a baby who won't stop
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
crying in the middle of the night who's
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
maybe KY um this is what primary
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
prevention at its finest it starts at
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
the very beginning uh right as babies
 
00:41:42.599 --> 00:41:43.510 align:start position:0%
the very beginning uh right as babies
are

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
born representative
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
paza thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question I wonder if parents
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
are aware that home visit may end up in
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
remote removal of the baby if there some
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
signs of neglect as you mentioned I'm
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
not sure I don't have the data around
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
that uh to support that claim but I can
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
follow up with
 
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
Shapero Mr chairman can I ask who else
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
has signed up I'm not sure who my
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
question is would be most appropriate no
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
one else has signed up to Tes can I take
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
have a question then sure go
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you for taking this question
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure sure you're the right
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
person to answer it but
 
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
um when I look under RSA 126 M3 it says
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
the intent of this act is to encourage
 
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
facilitate and promote primary
 
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
prevention and early intervention
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
efforts and it goes on a little bit so
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
my question really
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
is isn't the intent of this um wellness
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
and primary C Care Council already to do
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're suggesting that it
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
does um so so the question therefore
 
00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.349 align:start position:0%
does um so so the question therefore
would

00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
be what will change because of this
 
00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.030 align:start position:0%
be what will change because of this
specific

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
legislation chairman McDonald if I can
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
divert to my colleague from the W sure I
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
you thanks for the question um how it is
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
different is primary prevention is a
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
very large world of um different
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
interventions we can do the direction
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
and instruction of what the wellness and
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
primary prevention Council should study
 
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
and issue a to as a report to the
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
legislature is really a clear directive
 
00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:35.559 align:start position:0%
that we could do on our own but we're a
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
voluntary body and so this request comes
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
from the Omnibus last year discussions
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
with um you know senators and
 
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
representatives about what they the body
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
should be doing so supposedly we could
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
do it on our own but we look for
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
direction really from the legislature
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
and half for the past 25 years so thank
 
00:43:59.549 --> 00:43:59.559 align:start position:0%

representative

00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
Palazo uh uh are you aware of many cases
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
when Childs were removed from families
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
as a as a followup for home visit
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
because we heard about child abuse and
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
about neglect and that uh home visit is
 
00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
one of the ways how it could be
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
discovered uh thank you for the question
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh just as stated a number of the
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
activities that a home visitor will um
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
work with the family on is really to try
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
to mitigate try to avoid any abuse or
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
neglect um act activities so working
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
towards things like early screening um
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
helping to connect that family reducing
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
barriers to accessing things like Mental
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
Health or substance use treatments um if
 
00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
there's a barrier around Transportation
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
trying to really help to mitigate that
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire but not just New

little bit about before and I'm looking
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
forward to hearing about it again but I
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
hope nobody's going to ask me questions
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
thank you he thank you representative
 
00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
Weber okay uh signed up to speak on this

uh John Williams and Rob Barry from the
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
at least I don't I don't see Mr Barry
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
but I do see attorney Williams so
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
welcome back chairman McDonald and
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
members of the Health Human Service
 
00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs committee uh for the
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
record I am John Williams the
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
legislative director for Health Human
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
Services and I have to say there was
 
00:49:09.069 --> 00:49:09.079 align:start position:0%
some magical scheduling happening here
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
today because the exact subject matter
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
is now currently being heard in the
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
Senate Health and Human Service
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
committee on hp56 which your committee
 
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
entertained earlier uh prior to U
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
getting close CL crossover so that's
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
where attorney Rob Barry is right now uh
 
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
I am here uh to uh let you the committee
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
know that the department is supportive
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the concept I'm being very careful
 
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
with the word supportive of the concept
 
00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:35.079 align:start position:0%
of what's trying to be achieved here um
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
the provider Community for uh
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
Transportation around ambulances is
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
critically important and they've
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
identified a gap where they're not being
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
paid as you know from the prior bill
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
under certain circumstances so what um
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
this bill before you attempts to do is
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
to make whole to the extent possible for
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
those particular Services uh one item
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
that I bring to your attention that is
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
glaringly missing from the bill is the
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
requisite uh state federal match that
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
would be required for us to actually pay
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
for these additional cost uh to the
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
state so my request to this committee
 
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
even though you're a policy committee
 
00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
you can't do the policy unless you have
 
00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
the resources of doing it that we would
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
be required to getting an appropriation
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
of $1 million uh for a total fund
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation including Federal match
 
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
50/50 match uh for a grand total of $2
 
00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.430 align:start position:0%
50/50 match uh for a grand total of $2
million

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
total funds so that concludes my
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
testimony I am not an expert in this
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
area because he is downstairs testifying
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
on the other bill but I can certainly
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
take back questions from the committee
 
00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative representative
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
Weber and then representative
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
Leon thank you so much for being here
 
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
and um I guess my
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
concern if you were part of the
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
discussions on this if you could help me
 
00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.390 align:start position:0%
discussions on this if you could help me
work

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
through uh the language on lines 8 and N
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
which says providers shall be eligible
 
00:51:03.309 --> 00:51:03.319 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid reimbursement under this
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph only when all the following
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
requirements are met and as I read those
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
requirements some of them appear to me
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
to be somewhat contradictory in the fact
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
that one of them actually includes
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
people who are dead so um I'm I'm
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have any comments on
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
how to resolve A B C D and E and F uh
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
some of which are are clear and fairly
 
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
distinct but
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
um the concerns I have are sort of
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
um you have to both agree you have to
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
have the competency all of that makes
 
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:48.870 align:start position:0%
perfect sense but
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:52.069 align:start position:0%
perfect sense but
[Music]

00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
um I I just wonder if there are times
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
when some of these are going to get in
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
the way of others of
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
them and wondering why including when
 
00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
resuscitation efforts are
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
terminated um you have to agree that
 
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
there's not a need I mean you have to
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
both agree that there's not a
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
need uh but but it also seems to talk
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
about when you actively
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
refuse there might be a need and you
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
refused and you had already been treated
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
and that would be disqualifying and so
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
but I see Senator Apprentice so maybe
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
I'll hold that for her and take you off
 
00:52:30.079 --> 00:52:32.870 align:start position:0%
I'll hold that for her and take you off
the

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
hook uh hi I'm coming and lay this is
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
robberry General Council division
 
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
medicate I was just testifying h568
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
which is of course is the companion bill
 
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh and we certainly would seed our time
 
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
to Senator appris and again we support
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
strongly the concept of legislation just
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
looking for the necessary State uh
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
General funds to match so we can make
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
this happen thank
 
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Leon did you have a
 
00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
question for the department or um
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
Department thank you one of the areas
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
that was noted as lacking in this one is
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
when somebody comes for a fall and lift
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
assist somebody that is only able to
 
00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
stay in their home because um local
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
emergency services are able to lift them
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
when necessary would it be possible to
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
find out if that would be permitted
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
under the state and federal match and
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
what the appropriation would be
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
necessary should that be the case yes
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
that is part of the contingency of
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
language here in the bill but we can
 
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely find out whether that would
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the
 
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.549 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the
representative

00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
TZ uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a little I don't remember the
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
details since we have had these
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
conversations previously my
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
understanding was that the uh ambulance
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
services are concerned about not getting
 
00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
paid unless there's transport but
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot a lot of potential other
 
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
things including what representa wber
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out a specific stream of
 
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
potential events what about they just um
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
show up and do something that's not all
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
these things and then and then
 
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
additionally I don't remember where we
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
ended up with what do other payers do
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
like is this going to put us in
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
alignment with what all the other
 
00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
insurers do or does how does this differ
 
00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
like I'm not completely up to speed on
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
what other insurers are doing I'm more
 
00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
in the Medicaid space um but I think
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
Senator Apprentice can probably better
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
answer that question about the the
 
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
drafting of the bill I will say the
 
00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:33.589 align:start position:0%
drafting of the bill I will say the
department

00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
did like the way s SP 49 was drafted and
 
00:54:40.349 --> 00:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
as it came out of the Senate as amended
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh apart from the appropriation
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
language other questions for the
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.319 --> 00:55:04.710 align:start position:0%
 
gentlemen

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
and welcome Senator Apprentice please
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
please no by all means please come
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%

00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
HHS uh I U yes I had another bill to
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
introduce and we had a lengthy
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
discussion but I'm glad to be here so
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce Senate Bill
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
409 which I know you have heard a house
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
version of so let me uhu let me tell you
 
00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
a little bit about this but for the
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
record my name is Suzanne prentis I'm
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
the state senator from District 5 that
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
rep representing 15 communities a large
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
part of Grafton part a large part of
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
Sullivan including representative
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
Palmer's Hometown and one community of
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
marac County the lovely uh town of the
 
00:55:58.990 --> 00:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
new London so this bill I think as
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
you're aware would direct um would
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
direct the state of New Hampshire to
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
amend the Medicaid plan with the
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
approval of CMS so that patient or
 
00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:11.270 align:start position:0%
approval of CMS so that patient or
emergency

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
responses When Calls for help come in
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
and there is a decision to not to
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
transport because the patient doesn't
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
want to be transported and there may
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
have been some care provided the patient
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to be transported and there
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
has been no care provided the patient
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
has been actively resuscitated and
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they um they were they've
 
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
been try actually they've tried to
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
actively resuscitate them but they were
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
unable to and so they've had to
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
terminate resuscitation on the scene
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
what we have found um in not just in New
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but throughout the country is
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
that with the exception of a few of the
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
private payers private insurance
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
carriers there hasn't been
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for treat and non-
 
00:56:58.990 --> 00:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
transport so you may have heard of the
 
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
et3 project which was a federal
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
initiative under CMS was a pilot program
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
to evaluate this that got terminate
 
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
because it's there's a real need and
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you about the numbers in New
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but because this was ongoing
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic U and there were
 
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
multiple factors they decided to stop
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
the pilot program and so there's no real
 
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
data or no real action from Medicare so
 
00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
we have to turn to the States and then
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
the private payers some of which are
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
already doing this and say what is it
 
00:57:32.029 --> 00:57:32.039 align:start position:0%
that we can do to assist these
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
communities who are making these
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
responses who have people on call up 247
 
00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:39.720 align:start position:0%
to do this work and then there is you
 
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
know no reimbursement for them U so this
 
00:57:45.069 --> 00:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
is the the idea was to try to bring this
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
onto the state level deal with our own
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
State Medicaid plan see if we could get
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
that Amendment and even though it's not
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
a lot it's something versus the the
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
inability to collect anything right now
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
so here's what I do know after being in
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
this business for a lot longer than I um
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
for emergency medical services and I
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
ever thought that I um you know I when I
 
00:58:09.029 --> 00:58:09.039 align:start position:0%
first started this I never thought 35
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
plus years I'd still be you know a
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
paramedic and you know working but here
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
we are so the demand for prehospital
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
medical care has grown and the
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
capabilities of those that are providing
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
care in your communities that has grown
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
as well um to meet the demand um and the
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
number of ambulances and Personnel that
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
are readily available we know that
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals are low on available beds and
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
are experiencing much of the same
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage that the Emergency
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
Medical Services field is so our system
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
has been increasingly responding to the
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
needs of granite Staters that are not
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
life-threaten threatening um not
 
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate for transport they don't
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
want the transport to a hospital or
 
00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:55.720 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they were unable um to be
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
Rec itated these calls again they
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
require Personnel equipment Fuel and in
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
some cases they also require using
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
medical supplies that are on those
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles or come with those providers to
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
the scene presently again we can't build
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
Medicare U there are we can't build
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid unless we you know pass this
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislation uh we do know that Anthem
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
does have a code and does allow for a
 
00:59:25.039 --> 00:59:27.109 align:start position:0%
does have a code and does allow for a
non-transport

00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
non-transport
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
a to bill for non-transport but through
 
00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
this process we found that a lot of
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Service units didn't
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
even know that they could use that so
 
00:59:37.029 --> 00:59:37.039 align:start position:0%
the system is it's GNA have to gear
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
itself up to change the way that it does
 
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
business not just if we pass this law
 
00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
but now they're already talking about if
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
our you know if a patient has Anthem we
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
could actually bill for this and Anthem
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
kind of set the model in terms of the U
 
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
the hicp pick code that they used for us
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
to adopt into this discussion so under
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
medic I've already brought up that we
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
have the hipi code so let's talk about
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
um the situations that this could be
 
01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
used in and what I did is I looked at
 
01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire patient care protocols
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
so this is what our emergency medical
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
responders are working with and try to
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
align this as closely as I could with
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
the protocol so the call has to be
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
originated through you know a 911 system
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
or go into sometimes they go into a
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
local emergency dispatch but it comes in
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
as an emergency call um the patient
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
consents to evaluation and treatment but
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
after that evaluation they choose that
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
they do not want to go thank you very
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
much they do not want to go to the
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
hospital um the licensed paramedic or
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
emergency medical technician and
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
patients agree that there is not a need
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
for transportation by an ambulance this
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
shall include again when resuscitation
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
efforts are terminated the patient does
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
not request an actively refuses
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
transport to an emergency department for
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation the patient is stable for
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
referral to a patient's position or
 
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
other community resource or again
 
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately has passed away the
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
patient has the ability including the
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
mental capacity and transportation
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
resources to obtain assistance for
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
medically indicated followup I spent a
 
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
number of years working in emergency
 
01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
departments including up in the Plymouth
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
area and here in Cong ConEd and there
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
would be times when patients would
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
arrive by private vehicle after
 
01:01:32.829 --> 01:01:32.839 align:start position:0%
evaluation by an ambulance who has
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
responded and put those resources in but
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
they didn't need an ambulance so they
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
chose not to go but were able to consent
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
we capable and had a safe ride and came
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
to the emergency department in these
 
01:01:49.029 --> 01:01:49.039 align:start position:0%
instances it's reasonable to assume that
 
01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
a hospital bed may still be open for
 
01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
another patient that needs it it's also
 
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
safe to assume that the cost of the
 
01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
system including Medicade is less than
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
if charges for transportation for that
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
ambulance call were assessed as well as
 
01:02:04.589 --> 01:02:04.599 align:start position:0%
to occupy that emergency department bed
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
an assessment from whatever level care
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
provider midlevel provider or a
 
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
physician and any test that they decide
 
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
that they are going to do that is going
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
to be more expensive than focusing on
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
these situations where the prehospital
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
community has been trained to do this
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
work and has a protocol to do this work
 
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
and I will add on here that whenever in
 
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
doubt there's we use something called
 
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
online medical control if you've ever
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
worked at an ambulance or in an
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
emergency department in these situations
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
many times the ambulance service will
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
call in and say this patient really
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to go here's my assessment
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable sending them by private
 
01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle are you good with that and the
 
01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
physician confers or the nurse
 
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
practitioner or the physic physician's
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
assistant with the ambul and makes a
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
decision about where this where the best
 
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
the best possible disposition is for
 
01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.470 align:start position:0%
the best possible disposition is for
this

01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
patient uh providing for reimbursement
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
through Medicaid will bring some needed
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
relief to EMS to municipalities but most
 
01:03:06.269 --> 01:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
importantly will keep patients who don't
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
need to be in a hospital out of the
 
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:10.839 align:start position:0%
hospital I am aware that Minnesota
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
Georgia sou Carolina and Arizona have
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated Medicaid dollars specifically
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
to this this type of initiative
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
according to the Department of safey
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
trauma and Emergency Medical Services
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
information system in 2022
 
01:03:30.029 --> 01:03:30.039 align:start position:0%
total Statewide there were
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
216,000 106 calls for help when a
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
stadiums provider responded 59,000 of
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
those only 59,000 out of that were non-
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
transports where an assessment and some
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
kind of care took place and a
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
determination was made not to transport
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
that Pati again aligned with their
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
protocols so I'm I I understand that you
 
01:03:59.710 --> 01:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
have heard a similar bill um and I'm
 
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
certainly pleased to or would be honored
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
to partner with the the sponsors of that
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
bill to try to shape this policy and get
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
it across the finish line so that we
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
can provide some reimbursement if CMS
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
agrees to this to these communities and
 
01:04:18.269 --> 01:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
these ambulance services for their
 
01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
Staffing for their equipment for their
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
work as well as keep Pat honor the
 
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
wishes of patients and keep them where
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
they need to be and the last thing I'm
 
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
going to say is that the way the system
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
is set up now it's highly connected to
 
01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
transport so to get paid you have to
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
transport somebody but that doesn't mean
 
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
if they don't want to go you can't take
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
them that's that's kidnapping unless
 
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
they're you know unable to make a
 
01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
decision for themselves I want to make
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
that clear but this is where the rub
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
comes in there's a better way to do this
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm suggesting a better way to do
 
01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
this um and so I'm hoping for your help
 
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
that you might have
 
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you for
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
coming and thank you for taking my
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
question uh which I was in the middle of
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
asking the wrong person arrive so
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
um my question is a drafting question I
 
01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
mean I I understand all those
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
considerations that you have here but
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
the statute as it is currently before me
 
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
says on lines 8 and nine providers shall
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
be eligible for Medicaid reimbursement
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
under this paragraph only when all of
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
the following requirements are met and
 
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
they can't all be met in most conditions
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
particularly as I was in the course of
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
saying if somebody has not been able to
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
be resuscitated all of those other
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
things aren't going to happen uh so I
 
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
wonder if you would be concerned if we
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
draft that so that either either it can
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
be one of the following or perhaps take
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
a look I mean obviously anytime it
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
happens there there has to be proper
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
consent and and those kinds of things so
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
some of it I'm perfectly comfortable
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
having be mandatory but maybe it's it's
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
one from column A and one one or more
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
from column B um so if if that's okay
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's a conversation we could
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
go on having representative Weber thank
 
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
you for the question and it it should
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
it's a great catch you know you look at
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
things time and time again and then it
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
pops out at you so it should be you know
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
one or more there's a way that we can
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
work on the wording of this because some
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
of these stand alone and some of these
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
are in combination so I think that
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's a really important piece thank
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
you um I'd be happy to work with you on
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative Canon and
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
McKay I I sort of wanted to reinforce
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
reinforce representative Weber's concern
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
um having been uh in in a facility where
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
someone had overdosed in a in a restroom
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
and they had uh a friend that that
 
01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
administered CPR but the fire department
 
01:07:05.069 --> 01:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
and EMTs did show up to to assist and
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
the patient did respond to the CPR and
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
was was active the they were asked if
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be transported the answer
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
was no however this the question I had
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
because it it wouldn't fulfill the
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
number the letter F thing is that the
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
the individual was homeless and walked
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
away with their friend and as far as we
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
knew they had no method of
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
transportation uh so that that
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
particular item would not be fulfilled
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
um because they had no idea what would
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
happen to that individual when that
 
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
individual left the
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
premises go well thank you
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
representative Canon for raising this
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things I will share with you
 
01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.789 align:start position:0%
one of the things I will share with you
is

01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh oftentimes here here's the good news
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
is that we have um we have placed aeds
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
and we have placed Naran and we have
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
placed tourniquets in so many different
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
places that were actively able to engage
 
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
the public long before and the ambulance
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
service even gets there U most of those
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
cases with the exception I would say of
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
the Naran resuscitation U because I if
 
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
you're Prof profusely bleeding and need
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
a tourniquet or have suffered a sudden
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
cardiac rest for any other reason
 
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
medically indicated fall up is going to
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
require Transportation but there are
 
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
times um and it's not just with naram
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
but there are times when somebody um I
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
would say a DI even a diabetic is a
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
perfect example where you're able to
 
01:08:38.349 --> 01:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
actually raise their blood sugar they
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
are completely competent they don't want
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
to go we can give them just like when
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
they would leave an Emergency Department
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
EMS can give them discharge
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
instructions but whether they do it or
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
not we can't make them we want them to
 
01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
and we have to continue I think by doing
 
01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
something like this I think it's a a lot
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
less threatening that they don't want to
 
01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
go to the hospital we might be able to
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
ease them in to another place so I
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you're bringing forward
 
01:09:05.789 --> 01:09:05.799 align:start position:0%
that needs to be tinkered but understand
 
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
that we just like when someone would
 
01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
leave an emergency department they get a
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
list of here are the things to do for
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
medically necessary followup including
 
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
senior primary care provider did people
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
always do that unfortunately no but we
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
try our best but I just wanted to raise
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
it the way the way it's currently
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
written that that individual in that
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
case doesn't necessarily have
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation after they walk out of
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
the building they they also um received
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
Nar can from a local person in the
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
office thank you for raising that
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative representative McKay and
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank thank you Mr
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
chairman I've recently had some
 
01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
experience with ambulance use
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh I I have absolutely no
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
memory of of people coming to get me or
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
where I went or and and uh all of this
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
refers to the patient consents over and
 
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
over again uh that and uh the the others
 
01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.550 align:start position:0%
over again uh that and uh the the others
like

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
myself were not able to make any
 
01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:23.560 align:start position:0%
consent uh at all um in fact uh I don't
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
remember the three days of was in the
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
hospital or what
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
happened and I didn't know at all why
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
they got an ambulance from someplace
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
over in Kean to take me from the
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
hospital to the nursing home which is
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
also in conquer so that all of these
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
references to the patient does this this
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
this and this I think many other people
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
have the same experience that I had that
 
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
that there was no ability on my part to
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
make any
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
decisions on my part and nobody in the
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
house to make any other decisions so
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
that it it seems that this is making
 
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
requirements that in some situations are
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
impossible so thank you representative
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
McKay and it's good to see you here and
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
well sorry that you had that experience
 
01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.750 align:start position:0%
well sorry that you had that experience
thank

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
you what what I would like to share with
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
you is that if you can't consent you
 
01:11:27.679 --> 01:11:28.709 align:start position:0%
you is that if you can't consent you
can't

01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
say I you know I want um I don't if you
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
can't consent you either agree to the
 
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
treatment uh you know you agree or or
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
don't agree if you if you can't consent
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
then this doesn't apply to you because
 
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
you are so sick that you need other
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
protocols and other levels of care need
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
to be brought into your situation so
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
this is crafted very specifically for
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
people who don't who don't meet that
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
higher level of
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
illness or Acuity like they're super
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
sick that they need to go to to a
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
hospital this is for the folks that are
 
01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:05.510 align:start position:0%
hospital this is for the folks that are
um

01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
alert appropriately able to you know
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
answer questions about their
 
01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
surroundings their conditions and can
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
say yes I want to go or no I don't want
 
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
to go follow follow is is there some
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
place that deals with people like me uh
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
that I I don't see that in this statute
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
that this seems to be for coherent
 
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
people at the moment and I don't see
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
anything that refers
 
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
to what happens when I wake up to say I
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
didn't want to go to that blank blankety
 
01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.030 align:start position:0%
didn't want to go to that blank blankety
blank

01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
blank
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
so RSA 153a which governs Emergency
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
Medical Services enables the Department
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
of Safety in collaboration not even
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
collaboration they are required to have
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
a group of Physicians and mid-level
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
providers that actually write the care
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
protocols for all types of patients so
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
there is a a whole different document um
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
and set of training that would go with
 
01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
those situations and that is again under
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 153a I don't remember the exact
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
citation anymore I used to but sfc 5900
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
was where you would find the reference
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
to the prot a very brief followup uh I
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
think I needed to vent a bit and it's
 
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
okay and I think representative Weber
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
explained that transport is handled in
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
other parts of legislation so thank you
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
very much anytime and again good to see
 
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
you here representative Shapero and then
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr chair
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
um I think prior to your coming in first
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
of all thank you for bringing this bill
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
I know it's really important to you know
 
01:14:02.189 --> 01:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
new Ambulance Service in in keen and um
 
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
I know it's important
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
for services all around the state which
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
are in Jeopardy and besides it just
 
01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
seems illogical that it would work this
 
01:14:11.719 --> 01:14:13.550 align:start position:0%
seems illogical that it would work this
way

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
um so my question revolves around a
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
conversation that happened I think just
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
prior to you coming in the door which
 
01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.750 align:start position:0%
prior to you coming in the door which
was

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
um people from DHHS saying um one thing
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's missing in this bill is an
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation for $1 million to pay the
 
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
state um match for the additional
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that would be
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
necessary then in your testimony um you
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
talked about potential cost savings for
 
01:14:46.239 --> 01:14:48.070 align:start position:0%
talked about potential cost savings for
example

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
um you know somebody isn't transported
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
which means maybe they don't get further
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
tests that would be covered by Medicaid
 
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
um at the emergency room or perhaps they
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
don't get actually get admitted to the
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
hospital and um that Medicade
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for a stay at the hospital
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
is not necessary so you were referring
 
01:15:09.149 --> 01:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
to cost
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
savings so my question is and this might
 
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
be really impossible to answer any idea
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
about what those cost savings are and
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
what are those cost savings mean in
 
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
terms of really having the need for an
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
additional $1 million appropriation
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you and good to see you again
 
01:15:31.149 --> 01:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
this morning so I was able to get uh
 
01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
receive from Henry Litman I'm looking
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
because we had a little bit of a shuffle
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
here through my well organized pile of
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
papers I was not able to get the
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
hospital costs but I was able to get the
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
ambulance cost if we just started to
 
01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
talk about what it was to
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
transport by ambulance so hang on just a
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
second um I guess it was not I guess I
 
01:15:56.669 --> 01:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
understand from director Litman that the
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
way that they would have to do the
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
breakdown um to get this by beds is
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
different like by regions and hos
 
01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals it was it was simpler for him
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
to just focus in for me on the ambulance
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
side of this so let's say that um we
 
01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
have an als1 an advanced life support so
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
they require say intravenous therapy or
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
cardiac monitoring that's going to be
 
01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.149 align:start position:0%
cardiac monitoring that's going to be
$527

01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
$527
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
58 for that just that transport and that
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the ground mileage which
 
01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.990 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the ground mileage which
is

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
8.71 um and there might be other
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
supplies um so there's to consider that
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
and we don't have to apply to the entire
 
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
59,000 because not all of those are
 
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
Reach This level but start to think
 
01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
about you know that's just for the
 
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
prehospital side the hospital side and I
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
say this in fairness and with respect is
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to be more costly so if I had an
 
01:16:57.629 --> 01:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
exact I could do the tradeoff I was able
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
to at least look at the prehospital
 
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
numbers and have some comfort on what we
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
would be saving the system by keeping
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
these folks home and in terms of the
 
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation I mean this has been
 
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
through Senate Finance but I will Circle
 
01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
back to my colleagues to make sure that
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
it is um that we've tightened that
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
up follow up thank you um so I I realize
 
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
it's very complicated to get a like a
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
total amount um or an estimated total
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
amount even um and and maybe the um
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
folks from DHHS would be better able to
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
answer this but is it your opinion that
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
whatever savings we do end up
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
estimating might um mean a reduction in
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
that new appropriation or is it kind of
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
different areas
 
01:17:48.629 --> 01:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
different different
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
um you know different monies and so we'd
 
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
still need a full appropriation so we
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
can go back to director Litman and talk
 
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
to him represent it's my position that
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
what we would be investing in the non-
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
transports doesn't even cover what it
 
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
costs these communities to even just
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
staff and do the work as they're doing
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
so what we can the what the little that
 
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
would be broken up to give out would
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
still be less in total say of that
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars then what it's going to
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
cost if we transported all of those
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
people to the hospital that's okay and
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know if we want to so that that's my
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
position thank you you're welcome
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator for
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
bringing this and all of your experience
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
in this area when you were listing out
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
the the things that need to be covered
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
it seemed like there were different
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
specific categories and following what
 
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
representative Weber said it sort of
 
01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be teased out into these
 
01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
different category areas um because this
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
is so important um it doesn't make sense
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
to have the delay to put any of these
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
criteria into administrative roles but
 
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
because it's so important I think it
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
makes sense to get these different areas
 
01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
done my question would be if you would
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
be interested in us working maybe
 
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
through work sessions or something else
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
just really to roll up our sleeves talk
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
about these different items and figure
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
out how we can break it out into
 
01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
something that would meet these needs
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
that you've identified and specifically
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
outline those requirements so that we
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
can understand these areas of most
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
pressing need and make sure that we're
 
01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
addressing them in clear language so
 
01:19:25.629 --> 01:19:25.639 align:start position:0%
that it's not denied
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon for your
 
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
question I I would be I'm very open to
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
that um and I think that in having these
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
work sessions what we would want to do
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
is bring in somebody from the Department
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
of Safety that's the licensing agency
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
that coordinates with the development of
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
the patient care protocols and bring a
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
member of the medical control board in
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
and maybe one or two providers to work
 
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:55.719 align:start position:0%
with say whoever you assigned to this
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
including myself to to get the questions
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
answered that you need to see if there
 
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be additional language or we're
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
good to go where we are and as a
 
01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
followup followup and then as a
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up since this is an early Bill
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
we'd have to make sure that we hit the
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
gas and do this pretty quickly is that
 
01:20:11.629 --> 01:20:11.639 align:start position:0%
something you'd be able to maybe we we
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
can check calendars afterwards and see
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
if there's something we can get get on
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
so that we can we can address the
 
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised around the
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
other Bill and maybe find a solution for
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
both bodies to adopt sure absolutely
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions represent
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
TZ and then representative colazo thank
 
01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:29.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
um so between uh the other version or
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
the you know the house version of this
 
01:20:42.189 --> 01:20:42.199 align:start position:0%
issue and uh your really informative um
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
background that you've provided uh it's
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
clear there's a comprehensive list of
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
charges that are incurred and we also
 
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
have learned um that there's a lot of
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
concern about the ambulance company
 
01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
staying float um and that they're
 
01:20:59.629 --> 01:20:59.639 align:start position:0%
providing essential care in hospital
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
deserts and so uh you're you're really
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
good informative um uh what you
 
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
presented to us was really helpful to to
 
01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
understand especially some of the data
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
that I don't think we'd heard previously
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
um the part for me that I would like to
 
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
understand better is the bigger picture
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
of what happens um because we had so
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
much interest every time we've uh
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
touched this bill uh from the uh
 
01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.229 align:start position:0%
touched this bill uh from the uh
stakeholders

01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
H what happens with um I I keep hearing
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
that patients get bills for ambulance um
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
from ambulance companies and so I don't
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
understand how that fits in with this I
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
know we're crafting a specific solution
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
just for Medicaid but it's helpful to
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
understand the bigger picture and I'm
 
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have that
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
information so like when do patients get
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill is it for the all these other costs
 
01:21:50.669 --> 01:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
that they can't build Medicaid for or
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
how just just wondering if if we know
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
how that all fits together thank you
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
very much the question it's just my
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
daughter and I need to say sorry I'll
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
call you later um she's 27 and she so
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
I'm thankful that she still calls me all
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
the time um so this is a good thing now
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
your question so thank you very much for
 
01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.229 align:start position:0%
your question so thank you very much for
the

01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
question with the exception right now of
 
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
that we've been able to identify Anthem
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
none of these I go to your I you know I
 
01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
receive a call for
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
help I respond as part of an ambulance
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
crew I assess you I provide maybe you
 
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
know again it's a diabetic emergency and
 
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
I provide care specific care for you uh
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
which I've done this many times
 
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
including making them their own peanut
 
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
butter sandwich from their kitchen once
 
01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
they are like ready and you know to go
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
and they don't want to go um and maybe
 
01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
I'll talk to a doctor or maybe I won't
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
at that point we're done there's no
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
mechanism for billing but we have we've
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
you know we've answered the call we've
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
provided the care we've end of the
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
supplies which we want to do that's not
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
the point what we're trying to find is a
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
way to bring some sustainability into
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
these systems in these deserts that are
 
01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:05.639 align:start position:0%
really struggling so with the exception
 
01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
of Anthem right now I don't have another
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
place to point to um and so we have to
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
you know there is certainly Sigma and
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
Harvard Pilgrim Pilgrim that we can talk
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
to that of private payers but Medicaid
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide any reimbursement for
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
this um and Medicare doesn't and so
 
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
these patients you know they're not
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
going to get a bill because there's you
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
know they're they're not getting bills
 
01:23:30.669 --> 01:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
at least the ones that I know about and
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
there's no reimbursement for it except
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
that limited that one limited piece that
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
I've been able to carve out at this time
 
01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
or or learn more
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
about representative Paz off and then
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative we can I can I just say
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
one more thing sure just to make sure I
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
tie this together thanks chair but if
 
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
they get transported and again shouldn't
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
be transporting people who don't want to
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
go or don't need to go okay then it's
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
then there is reimbursement that is
 
01:23:59.550 --> 01:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
aligned in all of these situations it's
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
that other place so I think I left that
 
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
out and I wanted to make sure thank you
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
representative Palazo thank you and
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
different situation and uh fortunately
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
for me I don't have experience uh of
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
people dying in near me so I don't know
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
what happens but if a person passes away
 
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
is there still an opportunity for a
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
transportation do ambulances sometimes
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
transport corpses or is a total
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
Financial loss if a person pass
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
us thank you for the question so once um
 
01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
they are deceased um I also had the
 
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
experience of being an associate Deputy
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
medical examiner so once they are
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
deceased um the really the funeral home
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
and once first of all the medical
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
examiner for covering for the county is
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
called to discuss the situation and to
 
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
decide whether they are um rule in for
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
an exam which includes a site visit
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're rule in for an exam and meaning
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
you would go do this and potentially to
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
go to an autopsy and you would have a
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
state pathologist on the phone to help
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
you make that decision in all of that
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
whatever gets decided whether they are
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
going or they are staying home and then
 
01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
going to the funeral home that's when
 
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
The Possession takes place there
 
01:25:15.119 --> 01:25:16.950 align:start position:0%
The Possession takes place there
ambulances

01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
ambulances
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
don't they don't
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
transport um the they don't transport
 
01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.950 align:start position:0%
transport um the they don't transport
the

01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
deceased but I I have there have been
 
01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
situations where due to location due to
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
weather due to difficulty the right
 
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
thing to do for the family and everybody
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
was to put them in the back of the
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
ambulance and to get them someplace else
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
but at that point when they are
 
01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
considered their deceased by protocol
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
first it's to the medical County Medical
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
Examiner that's covering and then it's
 
01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
the funeral
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
home okay representative
 
01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:53.719 align:start position:0%
Weber so I'm interested in pursuing I
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
think repres representative tz's
 
01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
question about costs and it's my
 
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.149 align:start position:0%
question about costs and it's my
understanding

01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
that in currently the only people who
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
are allowing some cost recovery is the
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
Anthem program that you were talking
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
about but when those costs are not
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursed am I correct in thinking that
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
the options are number one you send a
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
bill to the patient who can't pay it
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
because they're already on Medicaid or
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
uh or either the service in the case of
 
01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
a private service or the taxpayers in
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
the case of a municipal or County
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
service are the people who are absorbing
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
those costs right
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
now thank you for the question
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I am unaware of any
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
services that are billing if they okay
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
go and they take care of somebody and
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
they don't transport them or they don't
 
01:26:58.990 --> 01:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
for either they take care of them or
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
some situations it's just an assessment
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
like checking them up some it is that
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
and there is care um I'm unaware that
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
that happens but what I do know is that
 
01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
because there is no reimbursement um and
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
again we know about this limit you know
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
we now are aware of Anthem um where
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
there's no reimbursement that means that
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
the cost shifting is clearly um to the
 
01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and you know they want to have
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
these well-trained
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
professionals ready to go 247 but if you
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
know there's we could continue keeping
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
them well trained ready to go 247 by
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
providing some relief and so where other
 
01:27:38.109 --> 01:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
states have turned to their State
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid plan it made sense for us to
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
try to do this and follow up and when we
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
say it falls on the taxpayer we are
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
talking about the local property tax is
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
that correct in the city of Lebanon
 
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
where I live if the ambulance does not
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know they go and they do any take
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
care of any of those circumstances that
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
I talked about and they return back to
 
01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
quarters you know that is part of what
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
we're paying for and if those so as a
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
final followup I promise I'll stop after
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
this one so if we were to adopt this we
 
01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
would at least get ourselves to a place
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
where uh half of the cost would be paid
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
by general fund
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and half of it will be the the
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
dollars that we're already sending to
 
01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
Washington DC and not getting all of
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
them back so we could get some more of
 
01:28:30.669 --> 01:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
them back to pay for a service we're
 
01:28:30.679 --> 01:28:32.149 align:start position:0%
them back to pay for a service we're
rendering

01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
rendering
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
here yes thank you other questions
 
01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.390 align:start position:0%
here yes thank you other questions
representative

01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
Palmer Dr hmer so my my concern and my
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
hope is that this would help the problem
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
that I see now which is quite frequently
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
we call for an ambulance transport say
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
from my hospital to Dartmouth and
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
there's there's a gap and it we
 
01:29:01.390 --> 01:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can take 24 hours before we
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
can get transport obviously it depends
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
on the the patient what I'm hoping is
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
that if we get a little bit more money
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
and it's going to make it a little bit
 
01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%
more possible for
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
um to expand Services um so that's
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's my real concern because it's been
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
scary at times um and that's um and I
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
guess so that's one sort of question
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
about how you think how you think this
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
might help the other one is
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
um with the Medicare um should we be um
 
01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
lobbying more on getting CMS to get
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
involved again and I'm going to
 
01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
Washington in a month to do that with
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
that um is there any effort locally in
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
that direction that I should be aware of
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
before I go to Washington so thank you
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer so I'll work I'll
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
answer your question back back of work
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
in reverse order okay so I since et3 was
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
cancelled I have spoken with u Senator
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
Shaheen's office I have spoken with
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
Senator hasson's office and
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative kusters there was at
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
least one initiative to do a
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
demonstration program with some direct
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
funding that would have gone into West
 
01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
Virginia you know West Virginia came
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
forward when et3 failed and said can we
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
try this pilot can we get some you know
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
Congressional direct dollars to do this
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
and that actually you know they
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
petitioned CMS was turned back um so I
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to continue this
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
conversation on Capitol Hill about the
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
situation with Emergency Medical
 
01:30:38.189 --> 01:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
Services as a system of care that we
 
01:30:40.109 --> 01:30:40.119 align:start position:0%
need to strengthen and this is one
 
01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
really important part of it the second
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
piece has to do with uh what you're
 
01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:47.119 align:start position:0%
seeing in emergency departments so some
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
of that is attributed to the fact that a
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
bed is occupied at where you want them
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
to go by the fact that they were trans
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
Ed because you know they were like okay
 
01:30:59.310 --> 01:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
you know they decided to go but they
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
didn't really need to be there they
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
could have had this consultation they
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
could talk to medical control and
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
decided you know what I'm going to stay
 
01:31:07.149 --> 01:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
home or I'm going to go to my primary
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
care provider or I'm going to go to
 
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
urgent care there's all of these avenues
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
that are now available to them but if
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
they get if they are transported to a
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
hospital that's a bed that is now not no
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
longer free for your patient from you
 
01:31:21.149 --> 01:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
know say that you know Windsor County
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont to make the trip up to um you
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
know dartman health or wherever that
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
might be you know from the financial
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
side on the ambulance services piece it
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
anything that we can bring in this is
 
01:31:35.629 --> 01:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
anything that we can continue to bring
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
in that makes their systems more
 
01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
sustainable will improve the
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
availability of the workforce when I
 
01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:43.400 align:start position:0%
first started doing this work and
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
actually it wasn't even when I first
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
started I worked in Northern New
 
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at ambulance services as a
 
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
paramedic I was paid $9 an hour okay now
 
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
that has gone up it's like maybe 20 $21
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
now it's still like there is um we don't
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
all do it for the money we love the work
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
but when you're deciding how to feed
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
your family and the career you need to
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
make of it and we're seeing these
 
01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
shortages in healthare people are making
 
01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
choices and so we're losing those folks
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
so I I hope that brought you where it is
 
01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
but take it to Capitol Hill thank
 
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:16.600 align:start position:0%

or good morning chairman thank you for
 
01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
letting me speak on this matter I my

name is Mike setar I'm the fire chief of
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%

01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
EMS service for Tilton and Northfield
 
01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
and and mutual Aid Partners in the belac
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
and M County areas um I'm but I'm here
 
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
today representing the New Hampshire
 
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
Association of bioch Chiefs and
 
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
supported this legislation and it it it
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
seems fairly simple uh for people who
 
01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:15.510 align:start position:0%
seems fairly simple uh for people who
are

01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um unfortunately they're in
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
that situation where they are onm
 
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and a lot of times the only way
 
01:33:25.229 --> 01:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
they get medic Services by calling for
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
the ambulance because a lot of them
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
don't even have means to get
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
transportation to a hospital or another
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
provider even if they were able to do
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
that so they call for us for the
 
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
ambulance and mo a lot of times we can
 
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
treat them right on the spot for for
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
whatever malady they have without
 
01:33:45.109 --> 01:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
transporting them to the hospital but if
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
we don't transport them to the hospital
 
01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
we don't get any reimbursement for
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid foot service so then we have to
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
so we do have to bring them to the
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
hospital if we want to get um paid for
 
01:33:58.350 --> 01:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
it but many times it doesn't make any
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
sense for us to bring him to the
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
hospital so end up we end up just
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
treating them and the cost of that
 
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
treatment and for our availability is on
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
the local taxpayer we're just trying to
 
01:34:12.669 --> 01:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
um offset some of our costs so the local
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayer is not absorbing the full cost
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
and as you all know we we do all pay off
 
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
federal taxes and it would be good to
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
have some of those tax dollars come back
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
and help support the local munit full
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%

questions not seeing any okay thankk you
very

01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
much also signed up to speak is Chris
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
dewi from the New Hampshire Ambulance
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
sir thank you my name is Chris dewas
 
01:35:06.990 --> 01:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
from holls New Hampshire I a uh
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
celebrating my 40th year as a paramedic
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh this year and I represent the New
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Ambulance Association I won't
 
01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
rehash everything that's already been
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
said but the Ambulance Association
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
supports this bill um to your point
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer about the
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
availability of services uh and how this
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
impacts that this is one piece of a
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
giant puzzle like a thousand piecer that
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
would take you forever to put together
 
01:35:32.669 --> 01:35:32.679 align:start position:0%
um that will hopefully fill a gap for
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that will allow us as an
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
industry to provide more services to
 
01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
people in a more timely fashion um the
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunate side of that is we seem to
 
01:35:45.390 --> 01:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
be opposed by the insurance industry at
 
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
virtually every step of the way which
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
makes it even more difficult as we as an
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
industry are very small fish in a big
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
pond um so I I would ask this committee
 
01:35:58.830 --> 01:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
to support this bill I would also be
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
more than happy to sit on any U work
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
group to look at ways that we can make
 
01:36:05.229 --> 01:36:05.239 align:start position:0%
this bill better and Define it more
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
clearly that would still get it past the
 
01:36:09.950 --> 01:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
Finish Line um and I'm happy to answer
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
any questions questions representative
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking this question
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious um given that this
 
01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.189 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious um given that this
situation

01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
I assume has been the the situation
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
um and there's so much interest in
 
01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
making a change right now I'm just
 
01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
interested in what what about the
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
current situation what about what in in
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the timing of the present
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
moment is this why is this coming to the
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
four right
 
01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:55.159 align:start position:0%
now I think there's a variety of reasons
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
we like every other healthc care
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
provider in the industry have had a very
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult time with Recruitment and
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
Retention after covid um you see it
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
across Healthcare you see it across
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
Public Safety um we've certainly had a
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
very hard time with inflation um the
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
cost to uh ret re to train people
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
initially and then retain them with a
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
living wage is astronomically higher
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
than it was um and then the workforce
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
challenge of today's Generation Um you
 
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
know I have three young children in
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
their early 20s who uh don't want to
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
work overtime they want to leave at five
 
01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
o'clock and in this industry that's not
 
01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
possible um and in our industry in
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
particular I think as Senator Apprentice
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned um we have been underfunded
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
and underpaid and under um not able to
 
01:37:45.950 --> 01:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
reimburse or pay people at a wage that
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
they deserve for the services that they
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
provide so I hate to use the analogy of
 
01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
a perfect storm but a lot of things have
 
01:37:54.109 --> 01:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
come together we've seen ambulance
 
01:37:55.589 --> 01:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
services go out of business in New
 
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in a number of different
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
places and that puts pressure on the
 
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
entire system um we are a cog in a wheel
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
and if that Cog is missing the wheel
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
will not continue to turn in a in a
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
rapid fashion thank you very much
 
01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.109 align:start position:0%
rapid fashion thank you very much
representative

01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
Weber I was going to ask just as a
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
followup to that question hasn't there
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
also been an evolution over time where
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
um ambulance services used to be just
 
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
transport that's what they did and they
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
tried to keep people alive till they got
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
somebody else sure um and I'm aware that
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
in my town sometimes we transport and
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
meet another ambulance where there are
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
more highly trained people who take
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
people further on But as time has gone
 
01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
on the people who arrive at your home
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
are more highly trained and more
 
01:38:45.149 --> 01:38:45.159 align:start position:0%
qualified to provide initial assessment
 
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
and treatment which simply didn't happen
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how long ago it was
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
that it didn't happen but that's a real
 
01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
evolution isn't it it is um you know
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
paramedics nowadays are practicing
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
medicine in people's homes and on the
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
scene and providing care that is akin to
 
01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
what you would receive in the emergency
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
room um you know I I mentioned I've been
 
01:39:08.589 --> 01:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
a paramedic for 30 or 40 years I should
 
01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
say I was paramedic number 37 in this
 
01:39:13.870 --> 01:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
state so uh you know and we weren't
 
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
doing a heck of a lot back then other
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
than uh compared to what we do now with
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of medications that are that
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
people are able to give and the amount
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
of diagnosis and advanced life support
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
treat that are out there so I think Co
 
01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
brought out a lot of things that people
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
were unaware of that paramedics and EMTs
 
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
can do and how valuable they are to the
 
01:39:36.109 --> 01:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
Health Care system as a an overall piece
 
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
puzzle other questions representative
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
Palmer just going back to your comment
 
01:39:47.550 --> 01:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
on opposition from insurance companies
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
so um I guess I'm trying to figure out
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
how much um I would think a lot of the
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
the non-transport patients or the
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
transport patients are are that tends to
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
skew towards the
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
Medicare bit um but I'm just trying to
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
get a if you have any sense of sort of
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
numbers of of transports or nonr any of
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
the idea of what the breakdown is
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
between private insurance and Medicare
 
01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:17.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid well you're correct Medicare
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid make up the line share of
 
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
most of the providers uh payer mix if
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
you will it's a about my understanding
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
is and depending upon where you are in
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
the state if you're in coldbrook it's
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
going to be different than if you're in
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth or or Keane um but the
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
commercial side of the insurance is
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 15 to 25% depending on
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
where you are and then you know there's
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
a difference in that commercial side of
 
01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:42.679 align:start position:0%
orisa versus non-erisa you know
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
self-funded plans versus other
 
01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank you thank
 
01:40:52.239 --> 01:40:54.870 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank you thank
you

01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
I have no one else signed up to testify
 
01:40:58.750 --> 01:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill does anyone else wish to
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
testify Senate Bill
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
409 if not um representative Shapiro
 
01:41:12.589 --> 01:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
indicates okay and on line six signed in
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
in support and no one signed in in
 
01:41:21.149 --> 01:41:21.159 align:start position:0%
opposition so with that I'm going to
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on Senate Bill
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
41 9 and open the public hearing on
 
01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 403 FN and Senator rosenal
 
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
her did she got me oh there she is okay
 
01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:43.000 align:start position:0%

thrilled actually to bring you Senate
 
01:42:19.159 --> 01:42:20.270 align:start position:0%
thrilled actually to bring you Senate
Bill

01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
403 this is a bill about build building
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
up the Future Health Care Workforce not
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
just retaining the workforce we have
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
which I think we all know is not really
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
adequate to meet the demands of our
 
01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.669 align:start position:0%
adequate to meet the demands of our
aging

01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
aging
 
01:42:45.149 --> 01:42:45.159 align:start position:0%
population and the lack of an adequate
 
01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce has not only led to increased
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
costs in the system that providers have
 
01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:53.719 align:start position:0%
had to pay
 
01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
enormous temporary staffing costs but
 
01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
there also indications that quality is
 
01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:05.480 align:start position:0%
at risk for example the Kaiser
 
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
Foundation reports that the number of
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
hours of Care nursing home residents
 
01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
received declined by
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
9% between 2015 and
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
2023 with nursing hours down a
 
01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:25.870 align:start position:0%
2023 with nursing hours down a
staggering

01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
staggering
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
21% so in addition to keeping the
 
01:43:32.669 --> 01:43:32.679 align:start position:0%
workforce we have we have to take action
 
01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure professionals can work at
 
01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
the top of their scope and also we need
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
to interest students in health
 
01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
careers this bill was um heavily amended
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
by the Senate and I don't know if you
 
01:43:52.719 --> 01:43:53.669 align:start position:0%
by the Senate and I don't know if you
have

01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
the original fiscal note but if you do
 
01:43:59.790 --> 01:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
please tear it
 
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
off um the one that said 32.1 million
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
yes tear that off okay and just deposit
 
01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
it in a recycling bin
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
um what the bill basically does two
 
01:44:17.229 --> 01:44:17.239 align:start position:0%
things now one it extends these repeal
 
01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
date on the commission on the primary
 
01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:20.589 align:start position:0%
date on the commission on the primary
care

01:44:20.589 --> 01:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
Workforce um and
 
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
secondly it creates a process for
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
oplc to certify community health
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
workers community health workers and I
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
think there are some here today are not
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
clinical staff but there are people who
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
have the experience the culture and the
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
language of the community in which they
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
work they're
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
facilitators and they importance to the
 
01:44:58.470 --> 01:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
broader Workforce is that they free up
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
the time of clinical licensed clinical
 
01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
staff so those professionals can work at
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
the top of their
 
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.030 align:start position:0%
the top of their
Scopes

01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
Scopes
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
certification of community health
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
workers will allow them to be reimbursed
 
01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
by private insurance but also by
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid the Department of Health and
 
01:45:26.669 --> 01:45:26.679 align:start position:0%
Human Services believes they have enough
 
01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds that they can use for the
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the short term really
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
for the next fiscal year ongoing funding
 
01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:41.560 align:start position:0%

01:57:58.149 --> 01:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
nursing assistant for two full years so
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
this uh Amendment to the nurse Practice
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
Act would cut in half the two-year
 
01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that's currently in
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
administrative rules obviously as you
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
know as legislators uh law Will trump
 
01:58:12.430 --> 01:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
those rules so this really is a
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
obviously you remember the the kma bill
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
that you uh were very kind enough to
 
01:58:20.109 --> 01:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
have that special public hearing and we
 
01:58:21.229 --> 01:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
were able to work with all the
 
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so I see see this as as
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
really a companion piece to that you
 
01:58:27.149 --> 01:58:27.159 align:start position:0%
heard that there's Sarah NATO who spoke
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
to this committee many times uh you know
 
01:58:32.430 --> 01:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
her facility doesn't have lnas so that's
 
01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
why we have the kma as a as an option
 
01:58:36.069 --> 01:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
for particularly some of those smaller
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
assisted living homes for facilities and
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
it could be a home health it could be a
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
nursing home it could be a larger
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility that employ
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
lnas under this they would be able to
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
send lnas that are in their employe to
 
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
the m&amp;a class
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
once they've been in LNA for one full
 
01:58:57.229 --> 01:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
year so this doesn't cost any money to
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
do this it's just uh removing an
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
administrative barrier I I certainly
 
01:59:03.550 --> 01:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to speak for the oplc but
 
01:59:05.470 --> 01:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
I did check with Lindsay Courtney who's
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
the executive director and she did tell
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
me that she was supportive of this
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
change and uh they don't have any
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
concerns from the the licensing uh state
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
agency that would that would implement
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
this so it would go eff would go
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
effective upon passage and as I said
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
it's a I think it's a common sense um
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
Workforce barrier that we're going to
 
01:59:26.669 --> 01:59:26.679 align:start position:0%
reduce and again it doesn't cost any any
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
dollars and the regulatory body uh is in
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
favor of it so I I hope that you will
 
01:59:33.310 --> 01:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
retain it in the bill as the Senate has
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
done so thank you very much thank you
 
01:59:38.229 --> 01:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
n a do thank you for allowing me to ask
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
a question thank you for taking my
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
question um would an medical nursing
 
01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
assistant earn a little bit more than
 
01:59:50.350 --> 01:59:50.360 align:start position:0%
just a
 
01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
regular and here you repr representative
 
01:59:58.030 --> 01:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
oh um would um it's Mna m&amp; would they
 
02:00:00.510 --> 02:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
earn a little bit more money per hour
 
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
than I mean LNA they would they would
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
have a higher level of training they
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be more valuable to the agency I I
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
can get you some numbers in terms of um
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
I I think that I have figures that show
 
02:00:14.589 --> 02:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
the average wage of the of an LNA and M
 
02:00:16.109 --> 02:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
that would be interesting and the m&amp;a is
 
02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:17.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit higher so but certainly
 
02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679 align:start position:0%
incentivizing for lnas to have another
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
step to move up quickly and help with
 
02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
our Healthcare needs thank you yes they
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be more versatile in the facility
 
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to obviously discharge
 
02:00:33.069 --> 02:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
more duties and also relieve the nurses
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
so they can focus on on larger Health
 
02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
Care issues so it it's a it's continu
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
minim of care U so again I think all the
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are in favor of this we we
 
02:00:45.149 --> 02:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
heard no opposition and it's a really a
 
02:00:47.470 --> 02:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
modest step and a companion to the piece
 
02:00:50.189 --> 02:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
of legislation that you already already
 
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.790 --> 02:00:59.800 align:start position:0%

exor
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
you've asked two minutes sir yeah thank
 
02:01:28.109 --> 02:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
you I'll be brief uh Paul friedricks I'm
 
02:01:31.069 --> 02:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
a retired family physician from exiter
 
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
spent 35 years uh working in a nonprofit
 
02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
Community Health Center in arachim
 
02:01:39.390 --> 02:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
County I want to make two points first
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
is in the course of my career it's it
 
02:01:44.669 --> 02:01:44.679 align:start position:0%
became more and more obvious to myself
 
02:01:46.589 --> 02:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
and the medical profession that the
 
02:01:49.629 --> 02:01:49.639 align:start position:0%
social determinants of Health are
 
02:01:53.350 --> 02:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
critical to uh uh our health in the
 
02:01:55.229 --> 02:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
community and to Health Care
 
02:01:55.239 --> 02:01:56.790 align:start position:0%
community and to Health Care
expenditures

02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
um what you need food you need housing
 
02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
you look need to look for insurance
 
02:02:03.790 --> 02:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation coordinating of your
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
services the second point I make is that
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
in my 35- year career I I had the
 
02:02:10.270 --> 02:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
benefit of working with community health
 
02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
centers community health workers excuse
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
me uh so I'm very much in favor of the
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
process for them to be certified and
 
02:02:20.669 --> 02:02:20.679 align:start position:0%
then to progress to enhance their
 
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
professional uh ability to work in the
 
02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
system and seek reimbursement from
 
02:02:30.270 --> 02:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
insurers um family doctors have a lot to
 
02:02:32.189 --> 02:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
do per care physicians have a lot to do
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
we need help uh and community health
 
02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
workers can step up and provide th that
 
02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
help address the social determinance of
 
02:02:41.709 --> 02:02:41.719 align:start position:0%
Health that is critical to our patients
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
and make a big difference and in the
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
long run save a lot of money by helping
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
us keep people out of emergency rooms
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
out of in their own homes out of the
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
hospital out of nursing facilities so
 
02:02:54.589 --> 02:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
it's a slam dunk as far as I'm concerned
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to me any
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
question are you taking any questions
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
sir I don't if we have any a
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative pmer thank you Mr chair
 
02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
02:03:06.589 --> 02:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
um I was also in Primary Care before I
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
became a hospitalist and I wonder if you
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
had the same experience with community
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
health workers which I found a godsend
 
02:03:15.069 --> 02:03:15.079 align:start position:0%
when we had them but we kept having we
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
get a grant and we'd have them and then
 
02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
we'd lose the Grant and they would go
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
away yeah and so I mean
 
02:03:25.069 --> 02:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
well that that's why this certification
 
02:03:26.910 --> 02:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
process is here to make them more
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
sustainable and it sounds like we have
 
02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
people like the women who spoke earlier
 
02:03:32.910 --> 02:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
who are happy to do their careers and
 
02:03:34.589 --> 02:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
very interested in doing that highly
 
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
motivated uh individuals serving in
 
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
these positions I had the benefit of
 
02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
serving in a federally qualified
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
Community Health Center so we had more
 
02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.030 align:start position:0%
Community Health Center so we had more
consistent

02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
02:03:47.470 --> 02:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
funding but yeah represented palazov
 
02:03:49.069 --> 02:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question I wonder what will
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
happen to a community health worker if
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
they fail to pass
 
02:03:59.549 --> 02:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
certification uh I have full confidence
 
02:04:02.189 --> 02:04:02.199 align:start position:0%
that the individuals that I worked with
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
community health workers would have no
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
trouble they've committed time years in
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
their lives often uh and are highly
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
motivated uh I don't see it as being an
 
02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
extremely um you know high-end test that
 
02:04:20.830 --> 02:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
they'd have to take it would be showing
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
that they have skills they have
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
amplitude uh and uh interest so I I'm
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
not too concerned about that okay other
 
02:04:37.229 --> 02:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%

social determinants of Health are key to
 
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
our health 80% of our well-being is a
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
result of where we live work and play
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
while only 20% is dependent on the
 
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
health care that we actually
 
02:06:06.430 --> 02:06:06.440 align:start position:0%

primarily by
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
grants and chw certification will assure
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
that we can find ways to reimburse them
 
02:06:15.629 --> 02:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
for their services and sustain this
 
02:06:18.750 --> 02:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
crucial member of the workforce we
 
02:06:20.830 --> 02:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
recently conducted a survey of community
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
health workers using using nationally
 
02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
recognized indicators called the chw
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
common indicators project highlights of
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
this report show that 58% of community
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
health workers in New Hampshire work in
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
community based organizations Family
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers schools insurance
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
providers and local Health departments
 
02:06:43.709 --> 02:06:43.719 align:start position:0%
42% work in clinical settings such as
 
02:06:45.629 --> 02:06:45.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals and federally qualified health
 
02:06:49.069 --> 02:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
centers chws are most likely to provide
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
care coordination and system navigation
 
02:06:54.270 --> 02:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
r gos as well as advocating on behalf of
 
02:06:57.790 --> 02:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
individuals and communities 78% of the
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
chws report working with people
 
02:07:02.669 --> 02:07:02.679 align:start position:0%
experiencing homelessness substance use
 
02:07:05.310 --> 02:07:05.320 align:start position:0%
disorders or people with disabilities
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
and some work with all three groups so
 
02:07:10.229 --> 02:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
we have been asking over the past year
 
02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
to have chws share their stories so you
 
02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
could really learn about what they do in
 
02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:15.589 align:start position:0%
could really learn about what they do in
the

02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:18.910 --> 02:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
community one chw shared a story with me
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
about helping a person who is living in
 
02:07:22.030 --> 02:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
a van
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
the person helped the person get glasses
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
which allowed him to get a job he was
 
02:07:31.709 --> 02:07:31.719 align:start position:0%
then able to get an apartment on his own
 
02:07:33.629 --> 02:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
so helping to build an individual's
 
02:07:36.189 --> 02:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
capacity to care for themselves is a
 
02:07:39.709 --> 02:07:39.719 align:start position:0%
fundamental part of the chw role other
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
themes that emerg from the stories
 
02:07:43.109 --> 02:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
include helping people manage their
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
chronic illness connecting people to
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
needed resources and providing linkages
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
to organizations that can meet their
 
02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
health and Behavioral Health needs
 
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
support of this bill will help New
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire care for the people living
 
02:08:00.669 --> 02:08:00.679 align:start position:0%
here thank you thank you perfect timing
 
02:08:02.430 --> 02:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Shapiro and
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
then representative Canon thank you Mr

chairman and um thank you for taking the
 
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
question there been a good deal of
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
discussion about among other things
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
about reimbursement for these Services
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
once someone is certified and I see at
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
the very end of the bill talks about
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid applying for a uh a Medicaid
 
02:08:23.109 --> 02:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
State Plan Amendment a Medicaid State
 
02:08:25.870 --> 02:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
Plan Amendment thank you um and so my
 
02:08:28.589 --> 02:08:28.599 align:start position:0%
question really is have those been
 
02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:30.679 align:start position:0%
requested in other states and approved
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
in other states yes absolutely and it's
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
part of the New Hampshire chw Coalition
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
we have a certification committee which
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
is working on drafting rules that we can
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
work with oplc to do um and thinking
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
about other ways of you know looking
 
02:08:47.709 --> 02:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
part of our research was looking at what
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
other states have done um including um
 
02:08:51.950 --> 02:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
you know exploring
 
02:08:55.109 --> 02:08:55.119 align:start position:0%
The Physician fee schedule for Medicare
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
the state plan Amendment and working
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
with other um insurance companies to see
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
if we can get help to cover the
 
02:09:04.709 --> 02:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
cost so do you have an idea of how many
 
02:09:07.549 --> 02:09:07.559 align:start position:0%
other states have have
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
um received approval for reimburse

high blood pressure high cholesterol and
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
obesity working with her was wonderful
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%

in a mobile healthc care setting
 
02:10:42.669 --> 02:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
bringing the care to the community and
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
spaces where it was needed along with
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
providing Medical Care to our patients
 
02:10:48.189 --> 02:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
through our providers were able to
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
assist in accessing resources and ways
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
to have their needs
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
met I also got to spend time working in
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
Reverse Primary Healthcare integration
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
programs Primary Care within the
 
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
community health care center here I was
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
able to work closely with a population
 
02:11:06.750 --> 02:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
that statistically does not receive the
 
02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
health care they require and often die
 
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
25 years earlier on average than those
 
02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the mental health care System
 
02:11:15.069 --> 02:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
well in this setting I was working with
 
02:11:16.510 --> 02:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
one woman in particular that had
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
extremely high anxiety she needed
 
02:11:20.830 --> 02:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
routine Medical Care and that was hard
 
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
for her
 
02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
often time patients are given referrals
 
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
to obtain care with a
 
02:11:28.830 --> 02:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
specialist and as I'm sure you all know
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
this can be difficult you get a referral
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
and then that place doesn't take your
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
insurance or you need an immediate
 
02:11:36.430 --> 02:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
appointment and they give you one that's
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
six months out this is challenging for
 
02:11:40.510 --> 02:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
anyone and then when you have a patient
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
who's already struggling with navigating
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
the healthare system has had experiences
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
that may not been the best in the past
 
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to be there I'm happy to be
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:11:50.239 --> 02:11:52.270 align:start position:0%
able to
help

02:11:52.270 --> 02:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
I work working with this individual I
 
02:11:55.470 --> 02:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
made sure she not only had everything
 
02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
she needed but I was also able to put
 
02:11:58.990 --> 02:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
the pieces together for her with that
 
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
support she attended her appointment and
 
02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
got the care that she needed I think
 
02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to remember that we are
 
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
here to help the community members
 
02:12:06.830 --> 02:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
attend to the things they need to do we
 
02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
are not enabling people to become
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
dependent on a system instead we are
 
02:12:11.870 --> 02:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
giving every interaction the best chance
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
to become successful we are here to
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
cheer them on and then to navigate the
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
barriers when they arise in my current
 
02:12:20.109 --> 02:12:20.119 align:start position:0%

02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%

02:12:34.990 --> 02:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
workers community health workers are
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
doing great work there are many spaces
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
not only in healthcare but mental health
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers schools and more
 
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
where chw integration has yet to start
 
02:12:45.149 --> 02:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
obtaining Community Health worker
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
certification will help sustain the
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
current Workforce and continue to Pro
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%

02:12:54.549 --> 02:12:54.559 align:start position:0%
and we want to be here to close the
 
02:12:58.149 --> 02:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
gaps thank you representative Shapero
 
02:13:01.149 --> 02:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I wonder in your
 
02:13:03.310 --> 02:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
um role as a community health worker or
 
02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
now is in supporting other community
 
02:13:07.950 --> 02:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
health workers how will this change
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
you're already doing it so how will this
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
change this added
 
02:13:15.790 --> 02:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
certification enrich your experience as
 
02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
a worker I when I say enrich I don't
 
02:13:21.870 --> 02:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
expect you to get rich but um um but how
 
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
will it how will it change either
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
materially or otherwise your situation I
 
02:13:29.549 --> 02:13:29.559 align:start position:0%
feel that the um the workforce will be
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
able to expand we'll be able to you know
 
02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
I I I work with a lot of people who are
 
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
community health workers and there it's
 
02:13:37.629 --> 02:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
Grant funded so they don't know what's
 
02:13:39.149 --> 02:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
happening at the end of this grant they
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
don't know how long the work is going to
 
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
be sustained so being able to be
 
02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
comfortable in your position and
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
continue working for it I think is going
 
02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
to be huge for the position thank you
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
representative pazo thank you Mr chair
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
02:13:56.510 --> 02:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh I'm trying to look uh
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
into some uh additional load on
 
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
community health workers so obviously
 
02:14:07.310 --> 02:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
they would need to pay by annual fee but
 
02:14:12.549 --> 02:14:12.559 align:start position:0%
also page four uh lines 31 and 32 talks
 
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
about any rules promulgated by the
 
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
executive director so we will have new
 
02:14:21.709 --> 02:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
Administration above you
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
promulgating additional rules on you
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
maybe additional paperwork so I wonder
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
how it affects the amount of work you
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
will be able to do besides following
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
asking so I just want
 
02:14:54.589 --> 02:14:54.599 align:start position:0%
if we create this new Administration
 
02:14:58.270 --> 02:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
above you and they will require you to
 
02:15:01.149 --> 02:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
spend time for certification to pay fees
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
for certifications to follow some
 
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
additional rules and paperwork that it
 
02:15:11.629 --> 02:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
will take from your ability to provide
 
02:15:11.639 --> 02:15:12.790 align:start position:0%
will take from your ability to provide
actual

02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
actual
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
work um I don't foresee it being a ton
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
and in my position where I support other
 
02:15:20.589 --> 02:15:20.599 align:start position:0%
community health workers I will I plan
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
to be a available to help them with any
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
of that that they may that they may need
 
02:15:27.629 --> 02:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
um I don't I see it helping us sustain
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
the workforce more than preventing us
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
from continuing what we're
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:38.040 align:start position:0%

02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
also in support of the partner
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
organizations that we work with they are
 
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
the Liaisons between the community and
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
between the organizations as well um and
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
I'll just tell you a quick little story
 
02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
so we have uh the opportunity they're
 
02:18:35.389 --> 02:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
the boots on the ground and so they are
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
the ones that have that extended hand or
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
provide that soft handoff between the uh
 
02:18:42.349 --> 02:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
organizations that might be providing
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
services to the community themselves so
 
02:18:46.589 --> 02:18:46.599 align:start position:0%
we have one individual that one of our
 
02:18:49.230 --> 02:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
community health workers uh met during
 
02:18:51.870 --> 02:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh Outreach who was living in the tent
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh was able to connect with this
 
02:18:55.150 --> 02:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
individual build trust with this
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
individual they had been living outside
 
02:18:59.549 --> 02:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
for eight years also was able to build a
 
02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
relationship with a landlord and was
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
able to get this individual housed in an
 
02:19:06.990 --> 02:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
apartment uh this was an individual who
 
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
had um issues with substance use
 
02:19:11.790 --> 02:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
disorder but was in recovery and in
 
02:19:13.790 --> 02:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
order to sustain recovery you need to
 
02:19:16.190 --> 02:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
have housing you need to be able to not
 
02:19:17.910 --> 02:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
think about things that are going to
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
cause barriers for you so the community
 
02:19:22.709 --> 02:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
health worker as liaison between this
 
02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
individual and this landlord was able to
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
get this person housed and one of the
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
things that this individual shared with
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
us was they are in a better position now
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
because they'd rather spend their money
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
on paying for supporting their housing
 
02:19:38.389 --> 02:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
needs than paying for substances so they
 
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
play a very important role in helping
 
02:19:42.349 --> 02:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
with the social determinance of Health
 
02:19:44.190 --> 02:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
as you've heard the community health
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
workers are there to make phone calls
 
02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
they've helped people get their driver's
 
02:19:49.710 --> 02:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
licenses they've helped them get their
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
um ID so that they could get jobs
 
02:19:54.190 --> 02:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
they're also helping individuals get
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
employment so this Workforce has been uh
 
02:20:00.349 --> 02:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
substantial for us and as gresa has has
 
02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
U mentioned they love the work that they
 
02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
do the certification will allow for us
 
02:20:06.670 --> 02:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
to maintain sustainability of this
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce you've also heard about we
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
have these um individuals in place
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
because of Grants the grants come and go
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of this year in January
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
I had to start telling my team I may not
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
have funding for you in six months so
 
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's disruptive for them and
 
02:20:24.429 --> 02:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
then one of the first questions they
 
02:20:26.309 --> 02:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
asked was what's going to happen to all
 
02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
the people that we now made contact with
 
02:20:30.750 --> 02:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
if we're not here to help them continue
 
02:20:32.429 --> 02:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
on their Journeys either in recovery
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
preventing evictions reducing emergency
 
02:20:37.230 --> 02:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
room visits or just making contact with
 
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
people to reduce social isolation so I
 
02:20:43.309 --> 02:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
stand very firmly in support of this
 
02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
certification um for the community
 
02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
health worker um and Senate Bill uh 403
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you will as well thank
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%

02:20:56.469 --> 02:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done okay thank you
 
02:20:56.479 --> 02:21:00.550 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done okay thank you
thank

02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
you and now Christine started you my
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
last print card do you want to testify
 
02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
by state Primary Care
 
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
Association thank you and good morning
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
um as a chair said my name is Christine
 
02:21:14.830 --> 02:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
Stoddard and I work for bate Primary
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
Care Association we represent New
 
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's community health centers
 
02:21:21.870 --> 02:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
which serve over 100 th000 patients and
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
many of them children and we also work
 
02:21:26.590 --> 02:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
with the area health education centers
 
02:21:29.389 --> 02:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
um like Paula mentioned earlier I want
 
02:21:32.349 --> 02:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
to stress that um our by state and our
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
members are very much in support of this
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill but what's important to remember
 
02:21:38.670 --> 02:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
about the community health worker piece
 
02:21:40.510 --> 02:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
is that it's voluntary
 
02:21:42.910 --> 02:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
certification so we worked very closely
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
with the chw community to draft this
 
02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
legislation um and of course with
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald because not every
 
02:21:54.510 --> 02:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
organization that um has chws takes
 
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or accepts commercial insurance
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure that we don't
 
02:22:02.190 --> 02:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
harm chws who are currently working with
 
02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
organizations that might not accept
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
insurance so it it is completely
 
02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary and so if an organization
 
02:22:11.349 --> 02:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
accepts Medicaid after the state plan
 
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
amendment is approved by CMS they will
 
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
be able to build Medicaid for those chw
 
02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
Services which will then sustain that
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce and
 
02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
almost all of our um community health
 
02:22:26.750 --> 02:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
centers employ chws the ones that don't
 
02:22:29.309 --> 02:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
the main reason is because of a lack of
 
02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
sustainability they too were in the
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
position earlier this year when they had
 
02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
to notify their chws that there might
 
02:22:37.710 --> 02:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
not be um grant funding available in six
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
months and thankfully DHHS was able to
 
02:22:42.750 --> 02:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
find additional funding to support that
 
02:22:45.710 --> 02:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
work but had they not those chws would
 
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
have been out of um would have likely
 
02:22:50.590 --> 02:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
lost their jobs and they placed such an
 
02:22:53.070 --> 02:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
integral role in people accessing
 
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
Community Health Services um that it it
 
02:22:57.790 --> 02:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
would have really harmed the communities
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
that you represent in New Hampshire um
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions if you
 
02:23:07.309 --> 02:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
Weber this is cheating but would you
 
02:23:14.070 --> 02:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
believe I just would really like to
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank everybody who's come here today
 
02:23:18.670 --> 02:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
for the work that they're doing I Su
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
others on the committee do as well thank
 
02:23:21.439 --> 02:23:23.030 align:start position:0%
others on the committee do as well thank
you

02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:23:25.710 --> 02:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative
 
02:23:28.670 --> 02:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
pmer this is a little bit a little bit
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
like would you believe too but I I don't
 
02:23:34.590 --> 02:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
know if you have any sense it an example
 
02:23:36.750 --> 02:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
I would give of what's what I've seen it
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
where I've seen Community Health worker
 
02:23:40.510 --> 02:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
really be helpful is I sent somebody
 
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
home from the hospital and the community
 
02:23:44.830 --> 02:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
health care worker goes out there the
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
next day and finds out that well they
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
didn't pick up the prescription for
 
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
their diuretic that was what got them
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
into the hospital in the first place
 
02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
because they either couldn't get there
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
or they didn't have the money and the
 
02:23:56.670 --> 02:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
community healthcare
 
02:23:59.950 --> 02:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
worker does that gets that job yes and
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
so my question is so on the one hand we
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
may be spending a little bit more money
 
02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
to pay for the community healthcare
 
02:24:07.309 --> 02:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
workers through Medicaid but I would
 
02:24:10.510 --> 02:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
imagine we are going to Save A Lot in
 
02:24:13.230 --> 02:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
both you know both human suffering not
 
02:24:16.269 --> 02:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
ending up in the ER again but also not
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
another hospitalization yes
 
02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative Palmer that's a really
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
good point Coos County family health
 
02:24:24.110 --> 02:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
services which is located in Berlin and
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
Gorham they have a large number of
 
02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
patients who are Homebound and so the
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
community health workers can go out and
 
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
check on those patients and make sure
 
02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
that they don't have rugs in the way
 
02:24:36.110 --> 02:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
that they could trip on um that if they
 
02:24:38.429 --> 02:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
need utility assistance they can connect
 
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
them with utility assistance many of our
 
02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
chws Al also work to um find housing
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
supports and also Mortgage Assistance U
 
02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic so they really are
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
um going out into the communities
 
02:24:54.750 --> 02:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
members of the communities and they can
 
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
connect people with Services if they
 
02:24:59.070 --> 02:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
need them and and honestly some patients
 
02:25:02.110 --> 02:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
don't know that those Services exist um
 
02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
until they're told by a
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
chw representative Plaza thank you Mr
 
02:25:09.070 --> 02:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:25:11.950 --> 02:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
question I I don't know if you are right
 
02:25:14.830 --> 02:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
qu right person to ask this question but
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
maybe you were at previous hearings on
 
02:25:20.030 --> 02:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
this bill so B what what will be the
 
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
side of administration to manage this
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
program I see there will be an executive
 
02:25:29.950 --> 02:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
director but also in fiscal note it
 
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
talks about eight paid positions
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
but Senator said that U that fiscal note
 
02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
might be outdated after the amendment so
 
02:25:47.469 --> 02:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
yes um the fiscal note is is outdated so
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
those were relating to appropriation
 
02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
sections that were removed by the Senate
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the executive director position
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
that's mentioned in that chw language is
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
actually the director of oplc so we will
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
work with oplc to draft the rules um for
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
the chws and it was written that way so
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
that we don't create additional
 
02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
administrative burden for the State of
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it was modeled after
 
02:26:17.550 --> 02:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
the opic dispensers um which already
 
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
exist other questions
 
02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:25.240 align:start position:0%

chairman I'm not sure if this is a
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
technical question or not um but feel
 
03:37:14.710 --> 03:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
free to wave it off um so I know there's
 
03:37:14.720 --> 03:37:16.389 align:start position:0%
free to wave it off um so I know there's
a

03:37:16.389 --> 03:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:37:18.550 --> 03:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh currently a program for healthcare
 
03:37:20.790 --> 03:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
workers in general I think it's called
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
the slurp program and I guess I'm
 
03:37:28.030 --> 03:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
wondering why having a why having a
 
03:37:30.910 --> 03:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
different separate program specifically
 
03:37:35.269 --> 03:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
for nurses May if there is a is it just
 
03:37:38.150 --> 03:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
kind of to add more to what we can do or
 
03:37:41.550 --> 03:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
is there a specific reason um why we're
 
03:37:43.950 --> 03:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
creating another program for one group
 
03:37:45.710 --> 03:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
of people that's an excellent question
 
03:37:46.910 --> 03:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's one that the Senate Health and
 
03:37:48.269 --> 03:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee also asked
 
03:37:50.269 --> 03:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
Senator Ganon he had set it up uh
 
03:37:52.630 --> 03:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
originally as introduced as a separate
 
03:37:55.229 --> 03:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
program and what they decided to do was
 
03:37:58.189 --> 03:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
work it into the sort program but that's
 
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's concentrating on Rural health so
 
03:38:03.550 --> 03:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
there might not be um it might not cover
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
all facilities uh that might not qualify
 
03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
as rural under the student loan
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
repayment program um and that's why we
 
03:38:13.110 --> 03:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
have the reporting requirement to say
 
03:38:15.189 --> 03:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
okay we're we're putting $300,000 in
 
03:38:16.750 --> 03:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
there let's get this going a little
 
03:38:19.229 --> 03:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
boost to nurses through the current
 
03:38:21.189 --> 03:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
pipeline but if it's not covering
 
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
anybody come tell us what we can do to
 
03:38:24.229 --> 03:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
make sure it's covering everybody we
 
03:38:26.510 --> 03:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
need to so yeah the the senate in its
 
03:38:28.590 --> 03:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment put it through the slurp
 
03:38:30.830 --> 03:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
program uh rather than a separate
 
03:38:34.910 --> 03:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
pipeline thank you very much other
 
03:38:37.189 --> 03:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:38:40.189 --> 03:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
Palazo thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just
 
03:38:45.710 --> 03:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out the numbers so the
 
03:38:49.189 --> 03:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
bill talks about a appropriation of
 
03:38:51.110 --> 03:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
300,000 and
 
03:38:54.990 --> 03:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
then Ann all cost is listed as uh over
 
03:38:59.469 --> 03:38:59.479 align:start position:0%
17 million per per year so I'm trying to
 
03:39:02.110 --> 03:39:02.120 align:start position:0%
figure out what we are actually doing
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
like how much we are spending
 
03:39:06.830 --> 03:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
additionally with this bill uh it is
 
03:39:10.429 --> 03:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
amended to a one-time non-aps $300,000
 
03:39:12.189 --> 03:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's the price tag
 
03:39:14.750 --> 03:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's the total cost the fiscal note
 
03:39:17.590 --> 03:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's attached to the bill as as it was
 
03:39:19.710 --> 03:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
introduced so that is no longer
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
applicable that that's how the program
 
03:39:24.269 --> 03:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
was introduced as amended it's a onetime
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
$300,000 appropriation representative
 
03:39:28.269 --> 03:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
who you wanted to add to that or no
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
that's exactly
 
03:39:33.990 --> 03:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay just just for anybody's information
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
they always come with a fiscal note that
 
03:39:35.760 --> 03:39:36.670 align:start position:0%
they always come with a fiscal note that
was

03:39:36.670 --> 03:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
drafted when the bill was submitted and
 
03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes we get extras we got three or
 
03:39:46.269 --> 03:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
four new redrafted fiscal notes to today
 
03:39:48.429 --> 03:39:48.439 align:start position:0%
but what's attached to the bill is often
 
03:39:51.790 --> 03:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
no longer what the cost is and this is a
 
03:39:54.750 --> 03:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
clear one time 300,000 if I'm not
 
03:39:56.070 --> 03:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
mistaken yeah that's correct if you'd
 
03:39:58.110 --> 03:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
like LBA I'm sure they could produce an
 
03:40:00.070 --> 03:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
updated fiscal note to you but in this
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
case the bill it's two paragraphs
 
03:40:03.990 --> 03:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
there's a number in it's not as needed
 
03:40:05.830 --> 03:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's a it's very clear in the bill text
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
itself that it's $300,000 it's one time
 
03:40:09.359 --> 03:40:10.710 align:start position:0%
itself that it's $300,000 it's one time
it's

03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:40:14.309 --> 03:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
non-aps thank you other

saw fit to to pass it as amended um what
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
this program does as was articulated by
 
03:42:00.790 --> 03:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Ganon staff member um is that
 
03:42:03.429 --> 03:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
this is a one-time $300,000
 
03:42:06.349 --> 03:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation to slurp State loan
 
03:42:10.030 --> 03:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
repayment program uh which is tasked of
 
03:42:11.630 --> 03:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
the mission of the state loan repayment
 
03:42:15.349 --> 03:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
program is to help to recruit and retain
 
03:42:18.510 --> 03:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
qualified caregivers into our Rural and
 
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
medically underserved areas of the State
 
03:42:23.189 --> 03:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh that are designated as such by the
 
03:42:27.550 --> 03:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
federal government um this bill Pro uh
 
03:42:30.149 --> 03:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
proposes two Provisions as we spoke
 
03:42:33.550 --> 03:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
about uh it appropriates $300,000 to the
 
03:42:36.710 --> 03:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
state laan repayment program uh for
 
03:42:39.510 --> 03:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
specific use of those that are licensed
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
under the nurse practice act so
 
03:42:44.149 --> 03:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
registered nurses uh advanced practice
 
03:42:46.469 --> 03:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
registered nurses and psychiatric nurse
 
03:42:49.590 --> 03:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
practitioners are the current eligible
 
03:42:51.670 --> 03:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh nursing professions for the state
 
03:42:53.910 --> 03:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
loan repayment program as was
 
03:42:56.269 --> 03:42:56.279 align:start position:0%
articulated earlier this is not in
 
03:42:58.550 --> 03:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
addition to the state loan repayment
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
program this has been uh as amended has
 
03:43:03.990 --> 03:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
been integrated into the state loan
 
03:43:05.710 --> 03:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
repayment program with the current
 
03:43:08.590 --> 03:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
policies and the current guidelines uh
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
that that govern that particular program
 
03:43:14.189 --> 03:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
uh the other piece that this bill would
 
03:43:18.070 --> 03:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
do is is to uh direct the department to
 
03:43:21.429 --> 03:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
establish a budget to establish a a
 
03:43:26.469 --> 03:43:26.479 align:start position:0%
separate program specific for nurses um
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
both of those uh we are in support of as
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
I said the current state Lo repayment
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
program is intended to incentivize the
 
03:43:36.429 --> 03:43:36.439 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention of qualified
 
03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
caregivers uh to our most vulnerable
 
03:43:40.590 --> 03:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
residents in our Rural and our medically
 
03:43:44.429 --> 03:43:44.439 align:start position:0%
underserved areas um as of right now we
 
03:43:48.550 --> 03:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
have 100 active contracts uh under the
 
03:43:51.070 --> 03:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
state loan repayment program the general
 
03:43:54.510 --> 03:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
funds that fund this program um are set
 
03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
to be expended we are are obligated for
 
03:44:00.149 --> 03:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
all of the monies that the general fund
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
has has um saw fit to appropriate to the
 
03:44:06.429 --> 03:44:06.439 align:start position:0%
program uh therefore uh we would be in a
 
03:44:10.349 --> 03:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
position of needing to put applicants on
 
03:44:13.550 --> 03:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
a wait list uh moving forward without
 
03:44:15.429 --> 03:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
this uh without this appropriate ation
 
03:44:20.830 --> 03:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:24.429 --> 03:44:24.439 align:start position:0%
um some of the things that this bill
 
03:44:26.110 --> 03:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
will do the
 
03:44:30.030 --> 03:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
$300,000 um will fully fund six to1
 
03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
full-time contracts with nursing PR uh
 
03:44:37.149 --> 03:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
nursing professionals into again our
 
03:44:39.790 --> 03:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
Rural and underserved areas um over the
 
03:44:41.870 --> 03:44:41.880 align:start position:0%

tier because they tend to have the
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
highest loan burden that they carry um
 
03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%

40,000 and just under um

$55,000 We Believe student loan
 
03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%

03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%

03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
important reference for Budget

state Primary Care Association and New
 
03:49:22.870 --> 03:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's community health centers um
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
our community health centers rely
 
03:49:26.229 --> 03:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
heavily on the state loan repayment
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
program to recruit and retain qualified
 
03:49:31.189 --> 03:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals it is often
 
03:49:34.670 --> 03:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
times the one thing that gets a healthc
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
care professional to commit to working
 
03:49:39.070 --> 03:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
at a ferally qualified Health Center
 
03:49:41.550 --> 03:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
they are located um as Sean said in
 
03:49:43.710 --> 03:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
medically underserved areas and often
 
03:49:46.030 --> 03:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
times rural areas is one of our health
 
03:49:47.830 --> 03:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
centers serves five different
 
03:49:50.710 --> 03:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
communities um people travel great
 
03:49:54.149 --> 03:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
length to work at these facilities and
 
03:49:57.309 --> 03:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
it is hard to recruit people um to work
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
in Northern New Hampshire depending on
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
what the opportunities are for their
 
03:50:04.229 --> 03:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
spouses or partners and the state loan
 
03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
repayment program provides a carrot to
 
03:50:08.910 --> 03:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
get people in the door and keep them
 
03:50:12.910 --> 03:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
there um our health centers would love
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
to see additional funding to the state
 
03:50:16.670 --> 03:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
loan repayment program as many of you
 
03:50:18.590 --> 03:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
know federal student loans were paused
 
03:50:20.349 --> 03:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and they were turned
 
03:50:23.790 --> 03:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
back on last fall and in
 
03:50:26.189 --> 03:50:26.199 align:start position:0%
2019 um the legislature approved a
 
03:50:28.510 --> 03:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
budget that included $6 A5 million do
 
03:50:31.149 --> 03:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
for the state loan repayment program um
 
03:50:33.189 --> 03:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
much of that funding was used for the
 
03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
state's pandemic response but the state
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
did retain o over $4 million for slurp
 
03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
and that money as Sean mentioned is now
 
03:50:45.070 --> 03:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
gone and so that demonstrates the need
 
03:50:47.189 --> 03:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
for the state loan repayment program and
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
how much we rely on it and the bill that
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier today um was
 
03:50:53.790 --> 03:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
introduced with a significant
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the state owner payment
 
03:50:58.110 --> 03:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
program and we would love for that to
 
03:50:59.870 --> 03:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
happen I realize that's not included in
 
03:51:02.389 --> 03:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
this bill but um any anything that you
 
03:51:04.750 --> 03:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
can do and to support the state loan
 
03:51:07.030 --> 03:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
repayment program is greatly appreciated
 
03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
because it is such an important tool for
 
03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
our um Health Centers to use I'm happy
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%

chandley and um I have the honor of
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
serving the people of Milford marac
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
Amherst and Wilton District 11 in the
 
04:04:05.670 --> 04:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
state senate um I come before you today
 
04:04:09.070 --> 04:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
to introduce SB
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
496 um
 
04:04:14.830 --> 04:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
which is a um um it directs the
 
04:04:17.110 --> 04:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:04:19.990 --> 04:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
to Monitor and respond to harmful
 
04:04:23.710 --> 04:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
impacts of um the climate and weather
 
04:04:26.070 --> 04:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
and the environment on mental and
 
04:04:29.710 --> 04:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
physical health um as we all know New
 
04:04:32.349 --> 04:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is experiencing changing
 
04:04:35.070 --> 04:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
weather um sometimes with extreme
 
04:04:37.510 --> 04:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
weather events I think that this week is
 
04:04:40.349 --> 04:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
a terrific time for me to be introducing
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
it because as we know we had quite the
 
04:04:45.910 --> 04:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
snow storm St last Thursday um there
 
04:04:48.149 --> 04:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
were a number of effects from that storm
 
04:04:51.469 --> 04:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
on our um electric and so forth but
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
there are also um effects on our envir
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
the environment around us from um these
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
changes in weather and some of the Very
 
04:05:04.429 --> 04:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
extreme conditions that occur um these
 
04:05:06.750 --> 04:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
might include longer growing Seasons
 
04:05:11.110 --> 04:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
later Fall Foliage intense heat waves
 
04:05:14.910 --> 04:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
rainstorms flooding wildfire s and air
 
04:05:18.910 --> 04:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
quality issues also that then affects um
 
04:05:20.950 --> 04:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
the the changes in the climate will
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
affect uh not just uh human beings but
 
04:05:29.630 --> 04:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
the uh whe what kinds of um insects or
 
04:05:32.790 --> 04:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
um it it has an effect on our wildlife
 
04:05:36.070 --> 04:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
and what our exposure is to potential
 
04:05:42.149 --> 04:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
diseases that uh maybe uh insect born um
 
04:05:44.189 --> 04:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
the the challenge
 
04:05:45.830 --> 04:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
the environmental changes are
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
challenging and I think that there are a
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
number of ways we in the state are
 
04:05:53.950 --> 04:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
trying to innovate in order to deal with
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
the uh being prepared for the changes
 
04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
but also we are concerned about any
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
harmful Health impacts um this bill
 
04:06:07.670 --> 04:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
would establish a position that already
 
04:06:10.910 --> 04:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
existed at one time at DHHS it was a
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
grant-funded position um and and it when
 
04:06:16.670 --> 04:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
the grant ran out unfortunately the
 
04:06:20.710 --> 04:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
position no longer existed um I think
 
04:06:23.469 --> 04:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
it's important that we understand and we
 
04:06:26.389 --> 04:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
can track these changes so that we can
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
come up with Solutions and uh innovative
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
ways of addressing the problems the
 
04:06:35.229 --> 04:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
changes may cause um we are everything
 
04:06:38.590 --> 04:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
is intertwined we know that our weather
 
04:06:41.630 --> 04:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
is intertwined with our human experience
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
with the wildlife around us with the Flo
 
04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
and the fauna it is intertwined and we
 
04:06:49.389 --> 04:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
need to be keeping track of the ways in
 
04:06:51.790 --> 04:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
which we may have negative harmful
 
04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
effects or in some cases perhaps there
 
04:06:56.790 --> 04:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
are positive effects but the more we
 
04:07:00.030 --> 04:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
know the better we can be prepared
 
04:07:04.349 --> 04:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
um I want to mention um like many people
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
I am running all of us here we are
 
04:07:08.670 --> 04:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
running from one meeting to another and
 
04:07:10.950 --> 04:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
I am missing a meeting that I should be
 
04:07:15.110 --> 04:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
in now um while I am very happy to take
 
04:07:17.910 --> 04:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
any questions you have I will also note
 
04:07:19.229 --> 04:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of people who
 
04:07:21.750 --> 04:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
are much more interesting than I who can
 
04:07:25.389 --> 04:07:25.399 align:start position:0%
tell you um about the reasons for this
 
04:07:28.269 --> 04:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
bill and why they are so supportive and
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
in fact propo proposed to me that I
 
04:07:34.830 --> 04:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
bring this forward um I want to also
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
note that uh there the fiscal Noe is
 
04:07:39.429 --> 04:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
completely changed since the amended
 
04:07:41.429 --> 04:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
version I worked very closely with
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Health and Human Services Senator
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
Bradley and with the Department of
 
04:07:47.710 --> 04:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to come up
 
04:07:50.149 --> 04:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
with a way we could uh reimplement this
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
position through Grant or other funding
 
04:07:55.389 --> 04:07:55.399 align:start position:0%
methods so with that I will conclude my
 
04:07:57.109 --> 04:07:57.119 align:start position:0%

climate change reverberate far beyond

environmental concerns they directly
 
04:09:18.030 --> 04:09:18.040 align:start position:0%

04:09:30.510 --> 04:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
these effects rather we're witnessing

firsthand the detrimental consequences
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
of a changing

04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
are harbingers of profound shifts that
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
endanger both our quality of life and
 
04:10:04.469 --> 04:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
economic Vitality of our
 
04:10:07.109 --> 04:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
state yet Perhaps what is less readily
 
04:10:09.950 --> 04:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
apparent are the direct impacts on human
 
04:10:11.950 --> 04:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
health from the spread of tick and
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%

in heat related illnesses and deaths the
 
04:10:21.189 --> 04:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
toll on our communities is already
 
04:10:23.469 --> 04:10:23.479 align:start position:0%
palpable we are witnessing an increase
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
in pulmonary and cardiac issues due to
 
04:10:28.030 --> 04:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
poor air quality
 
04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%

among my patients the Youth of our state
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
I implore you not only to consider the
 
04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
statistics and reports that you're also
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
that you will also hear uh the personal
 
04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
stories of the people that are affected
 
04:10:45.630 --> 04:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's a neighbor batt battling
 
04:10:47.830 --> 04:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
the debilitating effects of Lyme disease
 
04:10:49.469 --> 04:10:49.479 align:start position:0%

health strains exacerbated by climate
 
04:10:54.269 --> 04:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
anxiety these are voices that underscore
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
the urgency of action a recent report
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
estimates the annual cost of climate
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
change to the US economy at a staggering
 
04:11:04.309 --> 04:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
$820 billion a figure that continues to
 
04:11:04.319 --> 04:11:05.469 align:start position:0%
$820 billion a figure that continues to
rise

04:11:05.469 --> 04:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
rise
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
unabated these costs extend beyond mere
 
04:11:09.990 --> 04:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
Financial burdens they translate into
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
increased medical expenses and lost
 
04:11:14.189 --> 04:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
productivity perpet uating a cycle of
 
04:11:16.710 --> 04:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
suffering and economic strain while
 
04:11:18.030 --> 04:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
various government agencies in New
 
04:11:19.469 --> 04:11:19.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently monitor climate
 
04:11:21.389 --> 04:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
related events none are specifically
 
04:11:23.070 --> 04:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
tasked with addressing the resultant
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
Health consequences it is imperative
 
04:11:27.309 --> 04:11:27.319 align:start position:0%
that we fill this crucial Gap by
 
04:11:28.870 --> 04:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
establishing a dedicated program on
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
climate and health within the Department
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
of Human Health and Human Services this
 
04:11:34.830 --> 04:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
program would serve as a vital Nexus for
 
04:11:36.990 --> 04:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
collecting and analyzing data on climate
 
04:11:38.750 --> 04:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
related Health impacts as well as
 
04:11:40.349 --> 04:11:40.359 align:start position:0%
devising proactive strategies to
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
mitigate harm from implementing
 
04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
prevention approaches to ensuring
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatment responses and
 
04:11:47.910 --> 04:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
developing anticip anticipatory
 
04:11:49.630 --> 04:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
interventions this program would be a
 
04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
beacon of resilience in the face of
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
environmental uncertainty the time for
 
04:11:56.109 --> 04:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
Action is now we cannot afford to delay
 
04:11:57.750 --> 04:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
any longer in safeguarding the health
 
04:11:59.670 --> 04:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
and well-being of our communities we
 
04:12:01.550 --> 04:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
should do everything we can to ensure
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
that our littlest citizens of our state
 
04:12:06.030 --> 04:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
experience the full breadth of
 
04:12:09.309 --> 04:12:09.319 align:start position:0%
childhood by passing Senate Bill 496 we
 
04:12:11.710 --> 04:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
can assure for future Generations that
 
04:12:13.229 --> 04:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
our vision for the future is not my
 
04:12:15.950 --> 04:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
topic rather we can Empower them inform
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
them and take a significant step towards
 
04:12:19.710 --> 04:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
the building a healthier more resilient
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank you for your
 
04:12:23.309 --> 04:12:23.319 align:start position:0%
attention and for the commitment to the
 
04:12:42.109 --> 04:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:42.119 --> 04:12:54.469 align:start position:0%
 
state

04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.429 --> 04:12:57.439 align:start position:0%
red is on okay good afternoon members of
 
04:12:59.109 --> 04:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Michelle robers
 
04:13:00.510 --> 04:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
I'm the bureau chief for public health
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
protection within the division of Public
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
Health Services at the Department of
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I don't have
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
any testimony prepared today but I'm
 
04:13:10.070 --> 04:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that the
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
committee may
 
04:13:12.119 --> 04:13:16.429 align:start position:0%
committee may
have

04:13:16.429 --> 04:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:20.349 --> 04:13:20.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um somebody else
 
04:13:22.710 --> 04:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
who came before you said that there was
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
a identical or similar position um at
 
04:13:31.030 --> 04:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
DHHS prior and could you tell us a
 
04:13:33.870 --> 04:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
little bit about when that was for how
 
04:13:37.950 --> 04:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
long it was um what kind of data was
 
04:13:40.670 --> 04:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
collected that was similar or different
 
04:13:44.429 --> 04:13:44.439 align:start position:0%
than this bill sure um um so we did have
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
a climate and health program and it did
 
04:13:48.670 --> 04:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
support one position within uh the
 
04:13:50.670 --> 04:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Services it
 
04:13:54.109 --> 04:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
was funded through a CDC Grant um for
 
04:13:57.229 --> 04:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
climate and health and um we originally
 
04:13:59.910 --> 04:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
got the Grant in 2012 so we we were
 
04:14:02.349 --> 04:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
fortunate to go through two Grant Cycles
 
04:14:04.630 --> 04:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
it was four or fivey year Grant cycle so
 
04:14:07.349 --> 04:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
the last Grant began in 2016 and
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um we did not get funding
 
04:14:12.389 --> 04:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
again for a third cycle so uh the
 
04:14:15.389 --> 04:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
position ended did uh in 2022 I believe
 
04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
2021 2022 um and then the department did
 
04:14:21.550 --> 04:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
not have any funds to support uh that
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
program moving forward that being said
 
04:14:26.510 --> 04:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
we do have um some data that is on our
 
04:14:29.790 --> 04:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
data portal that is was part of that so
 
04:14:32.910 --> 04:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
um that includes um some heat related
 
04:14:35.790 --> 04:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
Hospital heat related injury and death
 
04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
we also the department also uh collects
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
data on uh Lyme disease as well and we
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
work closely with partner agencies in
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
particular the Department of
 
04:14:46.670 --> 04:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services on some of uh
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
like for instance air quality they do
 
04:14:51.070 --> 04:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive air quality monitoring
 
04:14:53.109 --> 04:14:53.119 align:start position:0%
and we have some of that air quality
 
04:14:54.990 --> 04:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
data also on the Department's data
 
04:14:58.990 --> 04:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
portal as well um you know what without
 
04:15:01.229 --> 04:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
funding uh for the position itself some
 
04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
of the work around education or building
 
04:15:05.670 --> 04:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
collaborations those are the challenges
 
04:15:08.269 --> 04:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
that the department has uh to continue
 
04:15:11.109 --> 04:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
that work without uh appropriate funding
 
04:15:13.550 --> 04:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
so some of the requirements laid out in
 
04:15:15.469 --> 04:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
the bill the department wouldn't be able
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
to do effectively without additional
 
04:15:20.349 --> 04:15:20.359 align:start position:0%
funding and um I know when the bill was
 
04:15:22.830 --> 04:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
first introduced the department provided
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note that kind of outlined some
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
of those uh
 
04:15:31.229 --> 04:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
limitations follow thank you
 
04:15:34.149 --> 04:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
so maybe this is too much of an opinion
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
um but in your it sounds like you've
 
04:15:40.030 --> 04:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
been at the department for a while so
 
04:15:43.870 --> 04:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
you know this history um in your opinion
 
04:15:46.710 --> 04:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
was the information gathered useful in
 
04:15:49.469 --> 04:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
terms of guiding Public Health
 
04:15:51.790 --> 04:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
efforts so I I can tell you been at the
 
04:15:55.030 --> 04:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
department for five years um I do
 
04:15:57.269 --> 04:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
believe that the data that's provided
 
04:16:00.070 --> 04:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
here is useful and is used uh relative
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
to concerns that people may have
 
04:16:04.950 --> 04:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
certainly on tick tickborne illnesses um
 
04:16:08.030 --> 04:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
also heat heat related injury and death
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
um so yes
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
do representative Weber
 
04:16:17.469 --> 04:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so given that the um position
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
that was in the original bill has been
 
04:16:23.149 --> 04:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
taken out and you're directed to do this
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
without the use of General funds are
 
04:16:30.429 --> 04:16:30.439 align:start position:0%
you um contemplating that the
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
work here is simply going to be split up
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
between existing employees or are you
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing Mr Williams head moving in
 
04:16:43.870 --> 04:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
various Direction Cs and I'm trying to
 
04:16:47.510 --> 04:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
read the tea leaves back there um or or
 
04:16:49.349 --> 04:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
are you
 
04:16:53.550 --> 04:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
contemplating simply using funds already
 
04:16:56.910 --> 04:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated that are appropriated and
 
04:17:00.109 --> 04:17:00.119 align:start position:0%
unspent uh to create a position are you
 
04:17:03.109 --> 04:17:03.119 align:start position:0%
going to be using so I think my question
 
04:17:06.070 --> 04:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
is current Personnel or are you going to
 
04:17:09.389 --> 04:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
have another person with funds that are
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
from somewhere else or from Grants I
 
04:17:14.309 --> 04:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
mean the grants in here so that that's a
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
great question um I can say that we
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
don't have funding currently for this
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
position um I I know that that we uh
 
04:17:25.550 --> 04:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
expressed that in our fiscal note that
 
04:17:28.429 --> 04:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
we would need funding to to for for this
 
04:17:31.630 --> 04:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
position to do this work um I really
 
04:17:33.429 --> 04:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
can't speak to whether or not we would
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
have any other funding in another source
 
04:17:37.870 --> 04:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
I just know what's what I currently have
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
that I sort of oversee and manage in
 
04:17:41.710 --> 04:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
terms of like what's available funding
 
04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
what we would likely do is try
 
04:17:48.070 --> 04:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
to the Grant from CDC which we had
 
04:17:50.910 --> 04:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
before is a is a competitive Grant and
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not there isn't enough funding
 
04:17:57.149 --> 04:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
to support every state so at the next
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
Grant cycle um we would you know apply
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
and hopefully you know we would be
 
04:18:04.389 --> 04:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
successful in getting that funding back
 
04:18:07.469 --> 04:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
but it's it's it's unknown at this point
 
04:18:09.070 --> 04:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
and could I have a followup followup
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
sure uh so this would be a necessary
 
04:18:14.429 --> 04:18:14.439 align:start position:0%
precursor to being able to apply for
 
04:18:16.510 --> 04:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
that Grant is that
 
04:18:19.870 --> 04:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
correct um I'm not sure on that I think
 
04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
the Grant application would you know we
 
04:18:23.950 --> 04:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
would have to meet the requirements
 
04:18:26.109 --> 04:18:26.119 align:start position:0%
spelled out in the Grant application as
 
04:18:28.830 --> 04:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
to be a successful Grant you know to be
 
04:18:30.910 --> 04:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
awarded from
 
04:18:30.920 --> 04:18:33.389 align:start position:0%
awarded from
CDC

04:18:33.389 --> 04:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
CDC
 
04:18:36.630 --> 04:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I I think I'll leave it at that okay
 
04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
because I'm verging on opinions so I'll
 
04:18:42.309 --> 04:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
step back other questions representative
 
04:18:42.319 --> 04:18:43.870 align:start position:0%
step back other questions representative
pazo

04:18:43.870 --> 04:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
pazo
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:18:50.510 --> 04:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um um if we expect
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
that there will be more heat related
 
04:18:57.269 --> 04:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
injuries do we expect that there will be
 
04:19:00.429 --> 04:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
less tourists who freeze to death in
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
White Mountains or are killed by
 
04:19:05.950 --> 04:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
Avalanches or do we expect that less
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
people will suffer vitamin D deficiency
 
04:19:11.790 --> 04:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
because it will be nicer weather outside
 
04:19:11.800 --> 04:19:13.630 align:start position:0%
because it will be nicer weather outside
to

04:19:13.630 --> 04:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:19:15.870 --> 04:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh have less closes
 
04:19:15.880 --> 04:19:20.149 align:start position:0%
uh have less closes
and

04:19:20.149 --> 04:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.349 --> 04:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
like that's a good question um
 
04:19:26.910 --> 04:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
I a climate and health program at the
 
04:19:29.149 --> 04:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
department would help provideed you know
 
04:19:31.830 --> 04:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
guidance and information and education
 
04:19:35.389 --> 04:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
uh to communities um and so you know
 
04:19:39.229 --> 04:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
through that um there's a you know a we
 
04:19:40.710 --> 04:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
would have appropriate Public Health
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
messaging to support communities and
 
04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
people in their decision making
 
04:19:48.189 --> 04:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
process representative
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
cofal uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:19:53.109 --> 04:19:53.119 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I'm I'm
 
04:19:58.109 --> 04:19:58.119 align:start position:0%
looking at lines uh 17 through 25
 
04:20:01.349 --> 04:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
approximately on page two or yeah in the
 
04:20:04.590 --> 04:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
in the main text of the bill and I guess
 
04:20:08.550 --> 04:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand why we need a
 
04:20:11.630 --> 04:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
distinct climate
 
04:20:15.109 --> 04:20:15.119 align:start position:0%
um climate and health Protection Program
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
as distinct from other functions of the
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
department so for example are we not
 
04:20:22.710 --> 04:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
already providing any guidance any
 
04:20:26.269 --> 04:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
public education regarding um heat
 
04:20:29.109 --> 04:20:29.119 align:start position:0%
related injuries are we not already
 
04:20:31.750 --> 04:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
providing public education information
 
04:20:34.309 --> 04:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
regarding tickborne illnesses are we not
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
already providing um information about
 
04:20:41.830 --> 04:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
um environmental crises such as poor air
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
quality flooding or or storms and so I'm
 
04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to
 
04:20:47.830 --> 04:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
understand how
 
04:20:51.269 --> 04:20:51.279 align:start position:0%
this what what unmet need is this would
 
04:20:53.750 --> 04:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
this program be
 
04:20:57.149 --> 04:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
filling so when I when I look at this
 
04:20:59.309 --> 04:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
bill so yes we are providing some of
 
04:21:02.429 --> 04:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
that messaging already but in order to
 
04:21:04.229 --> 04:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
you know when I read through and look at
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
at the requirements outlined in the bill
 
04:21:08.910 --> 04:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't have the Staffing
 
04:21:12.030 --> 04:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to proactively go out and and
 
04:21:14.870 --> 04:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
do that so often times um for instance I
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
can share an experience uh with last
 
04:21:20.870 --> 04:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
year with the wildfires um smoke that
 
04:21:24.429 --> 04:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
was happening up in um in Quebec so New
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was lucky enough to avoid that
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
by by virtue of a low pressure system
 
04:21:31.590 --> 04:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
that was sort of hanging out over New
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that directed the air quality
 
04:21:37.070 --> 04:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
around us but we saw pretty high levels
 
04:21:40.830 --> 04:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
in um massachusett you know I mean uh
 
04:21:43.750 --> 04:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
New York and other states around us and
 
04:21:47.590 --> 04:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
so we immediately kind
 
04:21:50.710 --> 04:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
of pulled our resources as best we could
 
04:21:54.269 --> 04:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
together to to to to work on a on an
 
04:21:56.510 --> 04:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
emergency response plan in the event
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
that the wildfires were to impact us um
 
04:22:02.550 --> 04:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
but we're so limited in resources that
 
04:22:05.309 --> 04:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
that pre-planning effort is challenging
 
04:22:10.389 --> 04:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
without having a specific um you know
 
04:22:12.670 --> 04:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
position related to climate so the
 
04:22:14.429 --> 04:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
department can do some minimal work
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
around it but if we're really focused on
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh bringing parties together and and you
 
04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
know we did a lot of interventions when
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
we had the position we worked with
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
communities on preparedness and building
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
resiliency and so that's the kind of
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
work that we'd like to continue to do
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately given our resources
 
04:22:35.550 --> 04:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
it's just really challenging um to be
 
04:22:37.630 --> 04:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
able to do that work along with all of
 
04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
work other
 
04:22:54.109 --> 04:22:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Joan
 
04:23:05.229 --> 04:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:08.429 --> 04:23:08.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire good thank
 
04:23:11.229 --> 04:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
you you indicated you want two
 
04:23:13.389 --> 04:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
minutes don't don't forget to put that
 
04:23:15.030 --> 04:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't forget to put put the microphone
 
04:23:16.710 --> 04:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
on yeah yeah I'll just summarize thank
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
you very much for giving me this
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak before you um my
 
04:23:23.550 --> 04:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
name is Joan Whitmer I'm a a 40y year
 
04:23:25.469 --> 04:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
resident of the town of ammer New
 
04:23:28.309 --> 04:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm also a registered
 
04:23:30.349 --> 04:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
nurse who formerly worked for Catholic
 
04:23:32.670 --> 04:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
Medical Center and also for home health
 
04:23:36.389 --> 04:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
and hospice care um during my tenure in
 
04:23:39.269 --> 04:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
the emergency department at CMC we would
 
04:23:41.469 --> 04:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
note that when there was high heat index
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
days which there were fewer back when I
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
did it that we'd see a significant
 
04:23:48.109 --> 04:23:48.119 align:start position:0%
increase in our patients coming in with
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
respiratory distress um generally these
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
were older patients with uh chronic uh
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
heart failure diseases and
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
COPD and they would be needing treatment
 
04:24:00.830 --> 04:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
in an emergency room which as you
 
04:24:02.950 --> 04:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
probably all know is a very expensive
 
04:24:06.149 --> 04:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
way to take care of people um if we had
 
04:24:08.349 --> 04:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
some preventative work that could be
 
04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
shared with the public in an education
 
04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
provided we might be able see some of
 
04:24:14.590 --> 04:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
this reduced over time and that's one of
 
04:24:16.990 --> 04:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
the benefits of this office in addition
 
04:24:19.070 --> 04:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
as as Jacob who preceded my testimony
 
04:24:21.309 --> 04:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
talk from a pediatric perspective
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
children have much smaller Airways than
 
04:24:25.950 --> 04:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
adults so they go into respiratory
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
distress much more quickly than adults
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
do and so you know when allergies are
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
significant and or um asthma kicks in
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
children become very distressed very
 
04:24:40.149 --> 04:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
quickly and and can lead up to including
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
death so we want to preserve the health
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
of our children more than um just about
 
04:24:47.229 --> 04:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
anything else in the state I would hope
 
04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
um in addition when I worked for home
 
04:24:52.189 --> 04:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
health and hospice you know my patients
 
04:24:55.550 --> 04:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
there um also would experience um
 
04:24:58.030 --> 04:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
increased respiratory distress such that
 
04:25:01.830 --> 04:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
our agency actually gave fans to
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
patients who didn't have air
 
04:25:06.149 --> 04:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
conditioning as and as many of us know
 
04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
we've you've lived here as long as I
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
have most housing stock in the state
 
04:25:11.429 --> 04:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
does not have air conditioning and so
 
04:25:14.349 --> 04:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
this becomes a big issue so that's kind
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
of just my own personal experience with
 
04:25:19.349 --> 04:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
this and and how health is a broad is
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
broadly impacted by climate um issues
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
sorry any questions sure representative
 
04:25:32.750 --> 04:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.309 --> 04:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
King are you familiar with the
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill how it's presented okay um so this
 
04:25:41.349 --> 04:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
goes along with the question that
 
04:25:44.590 --> 04:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
representative cop just asked uh the
 
04:25:44.600 --> 04:25:46.590 align:start position:0%
representative cop just asked uh the
previous

04:25:46.590 --> 04:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
previous
 
04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
testimony um I look at this bill and I
 
04:25:52.189 --> 04:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
see a lot of it where we're trying to
 
04:25:55.149 --> 04:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
understand what changes are taking place
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
and so on um but I only see like a
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
couple items in here that actually
 
04:26:04.189 --> 04:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
address a solution a plan on how are we
 
04:26:05.910 --> 04:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
going to deal with the information that
 
04:26:05.920 --> 04:26:06.630 align:start position:0%
going to deal with the information that
we're

04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:26:09.630 --> 04:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
Gathering W so my question is would you
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
agree that this bill should actually be
 
04:26:15.429 --> 04:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
more focused on the solutions than on
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
the collection of data um one of the
 
04:26:21.269 --> 04:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
individuals registered here to speak
 
04:26:23.469 --> 04:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
today actually held the position with
 
04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
the HHS and I would prefer to defer that
 
04:26:27.510 --> 04:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
question to him because he can much more
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
effectively answer it than I can if you
 
04:26:32.070 --> 04:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind that's M K helain he'll be
 
04:26:35.830 --> 04:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
speaking shortly sure um just so I'm
 
04:26:41.229 --> 04:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
aware of which individual this is do you
 
04:26:41.239 --> 04:26:42.910 align:start position:0%
aware of which individual this is do you
that

04:26:42.910 --> 04:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:26:44.670 --> 04:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking the
 
04:26:49.309 --> 04:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
question certainly I as I said he's he's
 
04:26:50.750 --> 04:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
much more proficient in answering the
 
04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
benefits but one of the things I think
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
um Representatives you all need to
 
04:26:57.149 --> 04:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
recognize is the impacts on health from
 
04:27:00.510 --> 04:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
climate change are changing regularly um
 
04:27:02.309 --> 04:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
for instance there's new studies out
 
04:27:06.030 --> 04:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
that indicate um that high Micron
 
04:27:09.590 --> 04:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
particles such as you find in wildfires
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
are actually um a possible precursor to
 
04:27:15.590 --> 04:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
um Alzheimer's and other dementias
 
04:27:17.309 --> 04:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
because they are able to pass through
 
04:27:19.830 --> 04:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
the naries into the brain and they
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
create the increased incident they they
 
04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
believe they create in increased
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
incidents of plaques that lead to the
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
these devastating illnesses in latter
 
04:27:32.389 --> 04:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
years um and this is based on clinical
 
04:27:35.070 --> 04:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
studies done in in a several locations
 
04:27:37.309 --> 04:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a new and evolving science
 
04:27:39.349 --> 04:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
and I think it's really important that
 
04:27:43.149 --> 04:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
as a state we need to be prepared for um
 
04:27:44.670 --> 04:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
the changes that are occurring on a
 
04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
regular basis as we learn more about the
 
04:27:49.109 --> 04:27:49.119 align:start position:0%
connection between climate and health
 
04:27:51.070 --> 04:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
04:27:53.550 --> 04:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um could you send me the the
 
04:27:55.389 --> 04:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
clinical information on that I'm also on
 
04:27:58.269 --> 04:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
this the committee on Alzheimer's and
 
04:28:00.670 --> 04:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
memory certainly I'd be happy and I'd
 
04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
just love to be able to review that data
 
04:28:03.389 --> 04:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
and see if that's something we need to
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
act on we already have a group that can
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
do that thank you well happy to any
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
other questions other
 
04:28:17.349 --> 04:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:21.109 --> 04:28:21.119 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is M Gard
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
from Max Gard from Plymouth New
 
04:28:26.510 --> 04:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
himself you asked for five minutes sir I
 
04:28:29.950 --> 04:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
would appreciate if you could do it in
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
free yeah I can I think I can go under
 
04:28:36.269 --> 04:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
that um hi uh my name is Max Goddard I'm
 
04:28:38.189 --> 04:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
representing myself I'm certainly in my
 
04:28:39.790 --> 04:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
personal capacity here today as a
 
04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
lifelong resident of New Hampshire but I
 
04:28:43.750 --> 04:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
do work work for the US uh forest
 
04:28:45.790 --> 04:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
service pmas ranger district on the
 
04:28:49.950 --> 04:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
trail crew um and in that capacity um I
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
have uh seen the direct impacts of uh
 
04:28:55.630 --> 04:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
you know the change in climate um I've
 
04:28:57.389 --> 04:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
grown up always hiking in the White
 
04:29:00.030 --> 04:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
Mountains uh now I'm working in them um
 
04:29:04.030 --> 04:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
seeing the uh amazing levels of flooding
 
04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh last year was uh my a lot of my job
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
is essentially managing people in water
 
04:29:12.269 --> 04:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
um and uh there was a lot of water last
 
04:29:14.469 --> 04:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
year um and it was uh really impacted
 
04:29:16.830 --> 04:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
the trails that caused a lot of safety
 
04:29:19.590 --> 04:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
issues um and things like that are
 
04:29:22.830 --> 04:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
likely going to increase as time
 
04:29:26.590 --> 04:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
continues um each year uh as we all know
 
04:29:29.790 --> 04:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
in the fall uh there's a lot of traffic
 
04:29:32.910 --> 04:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
that comes up uh and uh you know the
 
04:29:35.870 --> 04:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
Kang Kang magas highway is uh completely
 
04:29:38.309 --> 04:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
you know shut down every year for hour
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know takes four hours easily to get
 
04:29:42.429 --> 04:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
from one side to the other which is
 
04:29:45.550 --> 04:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
normally a little under an hour drive
 
04:29:45.560 --> 04:29:47.269 align:start position:0%
normally a little under an hour drive
and

04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh these uh you know increases of you
 
04:29:53.550 --> 04:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
know traffic and you know predicted you
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
know events that a lot of people are
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
coming to witness you know the beautiful
 
04:30:01.349 --> 04:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
things in our state um are you know
 
04:30:03.510 --> 04:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
predictable events and because of the
 
04:30:06.070 --> 04:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know very car Centric you know
 
04:30:09.710 --> 04:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
traffic system and uh inter uh the you
 
04:30:11.630 --> 04:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
know interstate highway systems that we
 
04:30:15.630 --> 04:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
have um there's a a lot of pressure put
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the Northern parts of the state when
 
04:30:21.149 --> 04:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
there are these uh events that bring up
 
04:30:25.870 --> 04:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of cars um when
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know a railroad or any kind
 
04:30:33.389 --> 04:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
of other less climate impacting ways of
 
04:30:35.590 --> 04:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
moving these people up into the state
 
04:30:38.349 --> 04:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
could be looked at and because we don't
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
have that the negative Health impacts of
 
04:30:45.429 --> 04:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
the resulting uh you know just
 
04:30:48.870 --> 04:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
Mass Dead uh you know highways for hours
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
and hours and obviously two days ago we
 
04:30:55.910 --> 04:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
all experienced that uh very very
 
04:30:58.830 --> 04:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
succinctly uh with the eclipse and the
 
04:31:02.429 --> 04:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
12h hour you know drives back uh to our
 
04:31:04.670 --> 04:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
houses and I even know some of the
 
04:31:06.790 --> 04:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
representatives on this committee were
 
04:31:10.469 --> 04:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh complaining about the response and
 
04:31:15.550 --> 04:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
the you know how that EV you know uh ESS
 
04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
of the northern part of the state you
 
04:31:19.109 --> 04:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
know was operated and I actually thought
 
04:31:21.149 --> 04:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
that the governor did a really good job
 
04:31:23.670 --> 04:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
of uh mitigating and
 
04:31:26.950 --> 04:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
managing what was an impossible scenario
 
04:31:28.670 --> 04:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of cars going
 
04:31:30.830 --> 04:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
down like three roads with you know one
 
04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
lane on the Notch and like there's
 
04:31:35.590 --> 04:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere for them to go because
 
04:31:38.830 --> 04:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
obviously how could there be for 10,000
 
04:31:42.269 --> 04:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
cars um and uh so I appreciate apprciate
 
04:31:44.389 --> 04:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know uh the vice chair
 
04:31:47.109 --> 04:31:47.119 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and her criticisms
 
04:31:51.630 --> 04:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
of that uh operation uh and must you
 
04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
must appreciate and recognize that these
 
04:31:57.910 --> 04:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
impacts are significant on our state and
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
we should be looking at the health
 
04:32:01.590 --> 04:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
impacts uh I'm I'm glad you know I don't
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
think there was any major you know uh
 
04:32:07.550 --> 04:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
health concerns uh you because of the
 
04:32:09.309 --> 04:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
successful you know mitigation and
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
management of the state but uh these uh
 
04:32:16.030 --> 04:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
events are you know the eclipse might be
 
04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know once in 40 years but every
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
single year we just accept that the Kink
 
04:32:24.910 --> 04:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
just you wrap up sir that's that's all I
 
04:32:27.269 --> 04:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
have okay any questions yes
 
04:32:30.349 --> 04:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative paza thank you Mr chair
 
04:32:33.510 --> 04:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question uh
 
04:32:37.389 --> 04:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
as you uh on the trail crew maybe you
 
04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
have some uh colleagues uh uh managing
 
04:32:44.469 --> 04:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
trails and forests we talk about
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
pollution from
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
wildfires if we expect this threat to
 
04:32:55.630 --> 04:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
increase uh are there any measures uh
 
04:32:58.830 --> 04:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
like if in the last 100 years New
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire got more trees more Forest
 
04:33:04.510 --> 04:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
growing around and managing Forest is
 
04:33:08.470 --> 04:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
very important to prevent wild fires
 
04:33:10.429 --> 04:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
could you speak a little bit is there
 
04:33:12.990 --> 04:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
anything being done
 
04:33:15.230 --> 04:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire Wildfire management
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
and prevention yes um well I actually I
 
04:33:19.670 --> 04:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
do have a a little bit of wildfire
 
04:33:22.029 --> 04:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
experience I've I've gone out west uh
 
04:33:24.750 --> 04:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
for a service and uh um on the Cedar
 
04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
Creek Fire and uh um another fire in
 
04:33:32.150 --> 04:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
Idaho and um I've I've gotten to respond
 
04:33:34.750 --> 04:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
to a few of the smaller uh Escape
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
campfires that we've had on the White
 
04:33:39.709 --> 04:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
Mountains uh the past couple of years um
 
04:33:43.070 --> 04:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
in a very small capacity you know not a
 
04:33:47.429 --> 04:33:47.439 align:start position:0%
senior firefighter by any means um and
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh I have you know I I have seen the the
 
04:33:54.510 --> 04:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
growing concern of the you know increase
 
04:33:57.070 --> 04:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
in fires and the increase in heat index
 
04:33:58.910 --> 04:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
which puts more pressure on these fires
 
04:34:02.109 --> 04:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
the droughts that we've had um and I I
 
04:34:05.670 --> 04:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
know the federal the forest service I I
 
04:34:08.990 --> 04:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
I mean I I'm pretty sure they seem to be
 
04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
aware of you know the climate impacts
 
04:34:12.670 --> 04:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
and they're looking at at that uh on a
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
state level I'm not a state employee not
 
04:34:19.830 --> 04:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm here as Federal capacity even
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
but that ANW you question yeah thank you
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
representative Lon uh thank you Mr
 
04:34:26.709 --> 04:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for following my
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
social media some of the hall h
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
conversations about it there actually
 
04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
may be some better solutions to do that
 
04:34:33.869 --> 04:34:33.879 align:start position:0%
but that's why it's great that people
 
04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
can have these conversations um so thank
 
04:34:40.390 --> 04:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
you for bringing what you have to us and
 
04:34:42.990 --> 04:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
um and I appreciate what you do for us
 
04:34:44.230 --> 04:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
in the forest service I wanted to be a
 
04:34:45.830 --> 04:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
forest stranger when I grew up so thank
 
04:34:48.029 --> 04:34:48.039 align:start position:0%
you for doing
 
04:34:51.070 --> 04:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
this okay any other
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you sir
 
04:34:53.760 --> 04:34:57.629 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you sir
thank

04:34:57.629 --> 04:34:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:00.990 --> 04:35:01.000 align:start position:0%

quick so uh thank you inviting me or
 
04:35:22.189 --> 04:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
being here to speak uh chairman Donald
 
04:35:23.990 --> 04:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee I'm Matthew
 
04:35:26.310 --> 04:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
Kain um I was the program manager who
 
04:35:28.390 --> 04:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
Rand it from this previous climate and
 
04:35:31.470 --> 04:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
health program from 2012 to 2022 when
 
04:35:33.070 --> 04:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
the the funding ran out I'm not
 
04:35:34.910 --> 04:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
currently at the HHS employee want to
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
make that clear I'm here as an informed
 
04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
citizen because I'm very still very
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
interested in this topic and I want to
 
04:35:43.470 --> 04:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
provide uh feed back um I worked in
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
public health for three decades mostly
 
04:35:46.590 --> 04:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
in environmental health issues I feel
 
04:35:48.590 --> 04:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
like I understand the big picture of it
 
04:35:50.349 --> 04:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
and I think what you get with this
 
04:35:52.029 --> 04:35:52.039 align:start position:0%
program if you're Bring It On is that
 
04:35:53.949 --> 04:35:53.959 align:start position:0%
balance view which is lacking right it's
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
lacking in the media it's lacking in a
 
04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
lot of places you get something like you
 
04:35:59.310 --> 04:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
see in the safe health impact assessment
 
04:36:01.470 --> 04:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
where you get a sense of how different
 
04:36:03.189 --> 04:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
problems relate and climate change isn't
 
04:36:05.029 --> 04:36:05.039 align:start position:0%
the worst problem it's one of those
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
issues we have to deal within the state
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
along with weather along with other
 
04:36:10.230 --> 04:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
things along with you know uh a lot of
 
04:36:11.590 --> 04:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
the different issues that are out there
 
04:36:12.910 --> 04:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
and I like think that balance is
 
04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
important um I care deeply about the
 
04:36:16.949 --> 04:36:16.959 align:start position:0%
problem of climate change but I also
 
04:36:18.429 --> 04:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
divide it up between weather and our
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
traditional climate and anthropogenic
 
04:36:22.269 --> 04:36:22.279 align:start position:0%
climate change I we need to understand
 
04:36:23.709 --> 04:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
all those if we're going to try and
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
understand the health impacts that are
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
coming from all those um I think one of
 
04:36:30.990 --> 04:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
your concerns is a recent assessment of
 
04:36:32.269 --> 04:36:32.279 align:start position:0%
climate research showed that there's
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
over over 50,000 papers published per
 
04:36:37.590 --> 04:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
year research papers on climate very
 
04:36:39.869 --> 04:36:39.879 align:start position:0%
hard to keep on top of that over a thou
 
04:36:41.629 --> 04:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
thousand of those make it into the popul
 
04:36:43.150 --> 04:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
media right where we get a sense of
 
04:36:44.670 --> 04:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
those and a lot of those relate to the
 
04:36:46.349 --> 04:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
most dramatic impacts and also to the
 
04:36:48.029 --> 04:36:48.039 align:start position:0%
health impacts and I think that comes
 
04:36:49.830 --> 04:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
back to you here right you have to kind
 
04:36:52.029 --> 04:36:52.039 align:start position:0%
of take those media reports and take
 
04:36:53.869 --> 04:36:53.879 align:start position:0%
that concern from the citizens and try
 
04:36:56.269 --> 04:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
to respond in some ways I think having a
 
04:36:59.070 --> 04:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
program within DHHS that does that is
 
04:37:00.590 --> 04:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
really helpful for you someone who can
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
prioritize and assess and understand I
 
04:37:04.429 --> 04:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
did send her on a fact sheet well you'll
 
04:37:06.150 --> 04:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
notice in the fact sheet which I helped
 
04:37:07.510 --> 04:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
write and put together with some other
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
staff is um it has a balanced view it
 
04:37:12.750 --> 04:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't and try to say we're not in the
 
04:37:14.510 --> 04:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
worth crisis ever it tries to say we've
 
04:37:16.590 --> 04:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
got real concerns related to weather to
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
climate they relate to other issues that
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
we've heard today like respiratory
 
04:37:23.109 --> 04:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
Health um and uh tickborne disease and
 
04:37:24.390 --> 04:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
things like that those are some really
 
04:37:25.789 --> 04:37:25.799 align:start position:0%
important things in New Hampshire and I
 
04:37:27.269 --> 04:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
think that kind of position would
 
04:37:31.390 --> 04:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
provide um perspective um on that um in
 
04:37:32.910 --> 04:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
there I talk about some of the things we
 
04:37:34.269 --> 04:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
accomplished but I think one of the
 
04:37:36.150 --> 04:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
questions that came up is why do we need
 
04:37:37.869 --> 04:37:37.879 align:start position:0%
a program like this I think a
 
04:37:40.390 --> 04:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
coordinated role is really important um
 
04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
it brings together all the other state
 
04:37:44.429 --> 04:37:44.439 align:start position:0%
agencies to say well we all have a piece
 
04:37:46.429 --> 04:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
of the pi of the pie here we're kind of
 
04:37:47.910 --> 04:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
seeing it from different views but if we
 
04:37:49.470 --> 04:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
have to answer our Public Health
 
04:37:51.429 --> 04:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
question prioritize it and find
 
04:37:53.109 --> 04:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
resources for it that's what the
 
04:37:55.150 --> 04:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
position can really help with I think
 
04:37:57.070 --> 04:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
the program is limited in some ways
 
04:37:59.510 --> 04:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
previously um mostly because of the data
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
we could get and I think a new program
 
04:38:03.629 --> 04:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
would do well um to focus on a couple
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
issues improve ability to collect data
 
04:38:07.590 --> 04:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
on flooding and pollen in New Hampshire
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
those are missing data pieces improve
 
04:38:10.869 --> 04:38:10.879 align:start position:0%
ability to collect data on health
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
impacts ESP esecially at the primary
 
04:38:14.551 --> 04:38:14.561 align:start position:0%
care center set setting we're very good
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
at looking at hospital and emergency
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
department data um develop better
 
04:38:20.269 --> 04:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
methods develop interventions to prevent
 
04:38:21.709 --> 04:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
people are talking about how we going to
 
04:38:23.109 --> 04:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
act here I think it's about getting on
 
04:38:24.990 --> 04:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
the ground and working with local
 
04:38:27.390 --> 04:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
communities and identify barriers
 
04:38:29.310 --> 04:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
limiting access to Safe affordable
 
04:38:31.269 --> 04:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
disaster resilient housing you could
 
04:38:33.510 --> 04:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
start wrapping up please all right so uh
 
04:38:34.510 --> 04:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
and that's important because that's part
 
04:38:36.551 --> 04:38:36.561 align:start position:0%
of the state health information plan too
 
04:38:38.789 --> 04:38:38.799 align:start position:0%
in closing my view as a health educator
 
04:38:40.869 --> 04:38:40.879 align:start position:0%
is that finding truth is a lot of your
 
04:38:42.551 --> 04:38:42.561 align:start position:0%
job and I think truth is a combination
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
of two factors accurate information and
 
04:38:46.470 --> 04:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
trusted sources and I believe this
 
04:38:48.830 --> 04:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
program could provide both of those um
 
04:38:50.590 --> 04:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
those two valuable assets to help the
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
legislator executive branch and the
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
public better understand these concerns
 
04:38:56.269 --> 04:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
04:38:58.029 --> 04:38:58.039 align:start position:0%
that anybody has those for I know some
 
04:38:59.310 --> 04:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
came up
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
previously representative
 
04:39:03.949 --> 04:39:03.959 align:start position:0%
bazo thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:39:07.230 --> 04:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh let's say New
 
04:39:09.470 --> 04:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
Services doesn't know how to deal with
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
longer growing period and longer pollen
 
04:39:21.109 --> 04:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
U allergies uh but uh we have a state
 
04:39:23.551 --> 04:39:23.561 align:start position:0%
south of us why can't we just ask
 
04:39:25.590 --> 04:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Massachusetts you have
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
longer growing period you have longer
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
Poland you maybe you have more more heat
 
04:39:34.390 --> 04:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
exposures tell us how to deal with it
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I mean you're right in away
 
04:39:38.230 --> 04:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
right we're we're our our climate is
 
04:39:39.830 --> 04:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
changing and it's going to be similar to
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
people states that are to the South us
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
so we should study those populations
 
04:39:45.390 --> 04:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
talk to those people say what have you
 
04:39:47.430 --> 04:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
discovered before I've often found in
 
04:39:49.708 --> 04:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
legisl proposing a a solution for
 
04:39:51.628 --> 04:39:51.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts isn't always the best
 
04:39:53.788 --> 04:39:53.798 align:start position:0%
approach to take but I hear what you're
 
04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
saying with there's a lot to learn from
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
people who have done it before and we
 
04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
won't be on our own well there'll be
 
04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
people who've experienced it and be able
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
that representative Leon thank you Mr
 
04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you so much for being
 
04:40:07.830 --> 04:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
here and especially bringing the
 
04:40:11.070 --> 04:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
expertise you have um in another bill we
 
04:40:12.830 --> 04:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
had had some information on data
 
04:40:15.030 --> 04:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
collection and data analysis and that
 
04:40:16.430 --> 04:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
was collecting data that was already
 
04:40:19.110 --> 04:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
available within the state and the
 
04:40:21.788 --> 04:40:21.798 align:start position:0%
expected Financial impact of that is
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
very similar to what I see here but it
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like in your pre in your in
 
04:40:28.230 --> 04:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
the previous role and what you envision
 
04:40:30.070 --> 04:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
for this for whoever takes on that
 
04:40:32.190 --> 04:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility there' be a lot more data
 
04:40:34.590 --> 04:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
collection and a lot more needs to that
 
04:40:37.110 --> 04:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
um and I'm curious how much you think it
 
04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
would cost on an ongoing basis in order
 
04:40:42.990 --> 04:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
to appropriately fill out this Vision um
 
04:40:45.390 --> 04:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
of of what you see the the need for this
 
04:40:47.550 --> 04:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
role and the need for this program in
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
order to actually address these issues
 
04:40:50.910 --> 04:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
in the comprehensive way that it seems
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
that you think we that you believe we
 
04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
should do sure we did a couple of
 
04:40:56.430 --> 04:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
contracts when we had this program in
 
04:40:59.708 --> 04:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
place with the USGS um and with UNH and
 
04:41:01.230 --> 04:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
others to say could you help us gather
 
04:41:03.230 --> 04:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
this data and realistically most of the
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
data was already available um it's the
 
04:41:07.110 --> 04:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
same when we collect information on
 
04:41:08.590 --> 04:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
emergency room data it's already an
 
04:41:10.190 --> 04:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
available data set that's collected by
 
04:41:14.070 --> 04:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
DHHS and man so I don't see a specific
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
strong new data collection system that
 
04:41:18.550 --> 04:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
will require a lot of money we did a
 
04:41:21.430 --> 04:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
small grant for $7,000 to the UNH Survey
 
04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
Center and we tried to understand better
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
how do people feel about uh climate
 
04:41:26.310 --> 04:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
change what are their opinions what are
 
04:41:27.708 --> 04:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
their perspectives I think that's
 
04:41:30.030 --> 04:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
helpful new data because it adds to data
 
04:41:31.590 --> 04:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
in the past and helps us understand
 
04:41:34.110 --> 04:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
what's happening now I did say in here
 
04:41:35.788 --> 04:41:35.798 align:start position:0%
specifically we're missing a pollen
 
04:41:37.510 --> 04:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire I tried to
 
04:41:39.750 --> 04:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
restart one through peers at UNH about
 
04:41:42.190 --> 04:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
10 years ago 15 years ago and I was not
 
04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
successful in keeping that going but
 
04:41:45.788 --> 04:41:45.798 align:start position:0%
that I think would cost in the range of
 
04:41:48.590 --> 04:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
80 to $100,000 a year I've talked to
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
peers at New Hampshire Dees and they
 
04:41:53.110 --> 04:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
said we'd install pollen stations along
 
04:41:54.990 --> 04:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
with our air quality data and maintain
 
04:41:57.030 --> 04:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
it if you could get us the capital cost
 
04:41:58.948 --> 04:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
of a $100,000 to do it that's what it
 
04:42:01.628 --> 04:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
was 10 years ago it could be less now um
 
04:42:04.670 --> 04:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
because it uses digital technology um
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
and we're missing data also on Mental
 
04:42:07.948 --> 04:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
Health but that's out there it's just
 
04:42:09.910 --> 04:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
harder to access and harder to link with
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events so I I think that
 
04:42:15.030 --> 04:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
the number I would have would probably
 
04:42:17.310 --> 04:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
be around there for it but we don't have
 
04:42:20.550 --> 04:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
to do that it's we want to expand it
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:36.270 --> 04:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Paul
 
04:42:40.110 --> 04:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
Fredricks from exor representing
 
04:42:40.120 --> 04:42:44.708 align:start position:0%
Fredricks from exor representing
himself

04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:46.270 --> 04:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
so you've asked for four minutes you
 
04:42:47.830 --> 04:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
keep to Clos the threee I'd appreciate
 
04:42:49.948 --> 04:42:49.958 align:start position:0%
it okay uh thank you chairman McDonald
 
04:42:51.868 --> 04:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
and the committee for having me back uh
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
again my name is Paul friedricks I'm a
 
04:42:55.230 --> 04:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
retired family doctor from exiter I'm
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
passing around my my prepared comments
 
04:42:59.470 --> 04:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to deviate from them to
 
04:43:01.030 --> 04:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
try to answer questions that have been
 
04:43:02.590 --> 04:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
raised good questions have been raised
 
04:43:06.270 --> 04:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
about the the bill this afternoon um and
 
04:43:08.030 --> 04:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
there are some references included in
 
04:43:10.430 --> 04:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make the point that
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
that clearly
 
04:43:13.470 --> 04:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
climate in New Hampshire is changing and
 
04:43:16.030 --> 04:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
I speak to that in my written testimony
 
04:43:18.030 --> 04:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
you can't have lived here 40 years like
 
04:43:20.990 --> 04:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
I have and not know that we had a 25y
 
04:43:22.708 --> 04:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
old guy up here a few minutes ago who
 
04:43:24.750 --> 04:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
said he's seen it in his life toown I I
 
04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
think that's pretty non-debatable that
 
04:43:28.430 --> 04:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
climate changing the other thing that's
 
04:43:30.788 --> 04:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
non- debatable is that the climate
 
04:43:33.628 --> 04:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
change is is changing some of our health
 
04:43:36.070 --> 04:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
concerns when I started practicing you
 
04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
know Lyme disease uh we'd say that if
 
04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
you hadn't been South of the Border to
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
Southern Massachusetts of Connecticut
 
04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
your fever and rash couldn't be Lyme
 
04:43:45.150 --> 04:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
disease because you don't get it in New
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's changed and other
 
04:43:50.830 --> 04:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
diseases are changing as well and uh the
 
04:43:53.708 --> 04:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
other important fact to know is that our
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
state P division of Public Health is not
 
04:43:58.868 --> 04:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
a plush division they don't have a lot
 
04:44:00.990 --> 04:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
of resources they don't have excess
 
04:44:03.948 --> 04:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
staff um you know the lead programs and
 
04:44:05.230 --> 04:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
things like that have been largely
 
04:44:07.550 --> 04:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
dependent on federal funds for years and
 
04:44:09.510 --> 04:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
to say that they're going to manage look
 
04:44:13.868 --> 04:44:13.878 align:start position:0%
at these changes and uh not only note
 
04:44:16.510 --> 04:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
them follow them but educate the the
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
population the communities are are are
 
04:44:20.868 --> 04:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
population and our patients about these
 
04:44:22.990 --> 04:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
health problems they just don't have
 
04:44:25.110 --> 04:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
those resources so the point of this
 
04:44:28.510 --> 04:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
bill is to say this is a priority at
 
04:44:32.030 --> 04:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
least one person in the whole HHS should
 
04:44:34.110 --> 04:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
be thinking about this coordinating this
 
04:44:36.030 --> 04:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
getting out information educating the
 
04:44:38.670 --> 04:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
public about it for example bosis how
 
04:44:41.230 --> 04:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
many people here have heard of bosis
 
04:44:43.230 --> 04:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
good some of you have much of the most
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
of the population has not the incidence
 
04:44:48.430 --> 04:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
of bbcos in New Hampshire is up 372 per
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
in the past decade whereas in Maine it's
 
04:44:55.150 --> 04:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
up 1, 1400% in Vermont 1, more than 1,
 
04:44:59.708 --> 04:44:59.718 align:start position:0%
1600% you know um representative Palos
 
04:45:01.868 --> 04:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
spoke about changing weather and
 
04:45:03.430 --> 04:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
temperatures and hiking in the White
 
04:45:06.110 --> 04:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
Mountains but yes people who have all
 
04:45:07.628 --> 04:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
this time hiked in the White Mountains
 
04:45:10.110 --> 04:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
in this summer aren't necessarily
 
04:45:12.750 --> 04:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
factoring in The increased heat the heat
 
04:45:16.190 --> 04:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
stress and the the emergency evacuations
 
04:45:17.708 --> 04:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
when they devel heat stroke on the
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
mountains in the summer and things like
 
04:45:23.628 --> 04:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
that so yes people in Georgia know how
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
to hike in the mountains in the summer
 
04:45:27.350 --> 04:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire residents aren't used
 
04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
to that we're we're people of habit we
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
get used to certain things we don't
 
04:45:34.150 --> 04:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
expect things allergy season you got to
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
start taking your allergy medicine two
 
04:45:38.470 --> 04:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
weeks earlier than you used to and but
 
04:45:39.868 --> 04:45:39.878 align:start position:0%
people are saying I always started my
 
04:45:41.948 --> 04:45:41.958 align:start position:0%
allergy medicine on April first I'm keep
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
doing that we need to get out and
 
04:45:46.430 --> 04:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
educate people with asthma and other
 
04:45:47.350 --> 04:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
disease that will get them in the
 
04:45:49.390 --> 04:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
emergency room if they don't know that
 
04:45:51.110 --> 04:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
that they have to anticipate the changes
 
04:45:54.910 --> 04:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
and factor that in so we're asking for a
 
04:45:57.310 --> 04:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
recognition of the changes and climate
 
04:45:58.948 --> 04:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
recognition and the health problems that
 
04:46:00.990 --> 04:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
have resulted from that here in New
 
04:46:03.310 --> 04:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the way that we have to
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
adapt as a population for the safety and
 
04:46:08.670 --> 04:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
health of our population and think one
 
04:46:10.030 --> 04:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
people one person in the state
 
04:46:12.390 --> 04:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
advocating that that is not excessive
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you any
 
04:46:23.910 --> 04:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:27.788 --> 04:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is sedon
 
04:46:30.548 --> 04:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
Savage from conquer
 
04:46:33.270 --> 04:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
representing thank you very much um s
 
04:46:36.430 --> 04:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
Savage I'm sorry my name is Sedin Savage
 
04:46:37.990 --> 04:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay and it's a pleasure to be here
 
04:46:39.990 --> 04:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chair members of the
 
04:46:41.548 --> 04:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
committee I give it to around three
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
minutes ma'am three minutes okay I will
 
04:46:46.590 --> 04:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
do that you've heard from others um I
 
04:46:48.270 --> 04:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
I'm a physician I'm actually a pain
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
medicine and an addiction medicine
 
04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
physician um I've worked in the state
 
04:46:53.868 --> 04:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
for over 40 years I've been on the
 
04:46:56.270 --> 04:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
faculty at Dartmouth all that time and
 
04:46:58.150 --> 04:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
testifying before this committee often
 
04:47:00.910 --> 04:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
around opioids pain and addiction so I'm
 
04:47:02.750 --> 04:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
really stepping out of my area of
 
04:47:06.030 --> 04:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
expertise and my usual professional role
 
04:47:08.150 --> 04:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
to come to you today and I'm doing that
 
04:47:10.270 --> 04:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
because along with many of my colleagues
 
04:47:12.390 --> 04:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
who are here I really believe that the
 
04:47:16.110 --> 04:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
impact on of climate change on health is
 
04:47:17.948 --> 04:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
the single most important health issue
 
04:47:20.070 --> 04:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
that we are facing as a state as a
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
country and as a globe going forward um
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
it is really an existential uh issue for
 
04:47:28.390 --> 04:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
all of us particularly for our children
 
04:47:30.628 --> 04:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
and particularly for our children's uh
 
04:47:35.310 --> 04:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
children and our grandchildren um so um
 
04:47:37.708 --> 04:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh I really want to focus on why this
 
04:47:40.230 --> 04:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
office will be important um one of the
 
04:47:42.110 --> 04:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
things that I been doing with growing
 
04:47:45.510 --> 04:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
concern around um climate and health is
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
um helping to convene a group of
 
04:47:51.270 --> 04:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
researchers clinicians and Educators
 
04:47:53.230 --> 04:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
across the Dartmouth system where I've
 
04:47:56.350 --> 04:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
worked um for most of my career um both
 
04:47:58.548 --> 04:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth health and um the
 
04:48:00.868 --> 04:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
university there we're coming together
 
04:48:03.510 --> 04:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
to really try and address these issues
 
04:48:05.708 --> 04:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
in a coordinated way and network our
 
04:48:09.190 --> 04:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
efforts so there are a number of efforts
 
04:48:10.548 --> 04:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
within the medical community that are
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
Happ happen we're working on educating
 
04:48:14.750 --> 04:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
students uh medical students so that
 
04:48:16.548 --> 04:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
they understand the impact of climate
 
04:48:18.310 --> 04:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
and health we weren't raised
 
04:48:20.230 --> 04:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
understanding these impacts and so that
 
04:48:22.750 --> 04:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
they're prepared to address the impacts
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
and help prevent the impacts among their
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
patients we're trying to make our health
 
04:48:29.670 --> 04:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
system more environmentally sustainable
 
04:48:31.310 --> 04:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
we know that Health Systems contribute
 
04:48:34.470 --> 04:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
about 10% of our country's um greenhouse
 
04:48:36.628 --> 04:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
gases and we're part of the problem we
 
04:48:39.030 --> 04:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
have to do better um we are trying to
 
04:48:40.990 --> 04:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
support practicing Physicians and
 
04:48:42.390 --> 04:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
connecting the dots between their
 
04:48:45.150 --> 04:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
patients illnesses and um climate and
 
04:48:47.070 --> 04:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
health and many of us are trying to
 
04:48:48.948 --> 04:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
educate the public directly about the
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
impacts and how to present themselves
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
but how this relates to this program
 
04:48:56.990 --> 04:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
that we are supporting is that in order
 
04:48:59.590 --> 04:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
to do this well to do it efficiently and
 
04:49:01.750 --> 04:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
cost effectively we really need to
 
04:49:04.230 --> 04:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
Target our limited resources so we need
 
04:49:08.750 --> 04:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
data um of of all types to be able to um
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh think about how to do this well
 
04:49:12.868 --> 04:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
questions like where in the state
 
04:49:15.190 --> 04:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
regionally what data on how this is
 
04:49:17.548 --> 04:49:17.558 align:start position:0%
regionally impacting the state um where
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
are tick and mosquito born illnesses
 
04:49:21.910 --> 04:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
more most prevalent um what are the
 
04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
regional patterns of poor air quality
 
04:49:27.110 --> 04:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
that are related to Wildfire smoke or to
 
04:49:28.830 --> 04:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
other forms of air pollution where
 
04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
should we put cooling stations where
 
04:49:32.510 --> 04:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
should we put tornado shelters to
 
04:49:34.350 --> 04:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
protect from extreme weather what
 
04:49:37.110 --> 04:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
regions agriculture are most vulnerable
 
04:49:39.150 --> 04:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
to flooding we need data on the
 
04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
vulnerability of different populations
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
which young athletes which kinds of
 
04:49:46.270 --> 04:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
outdoor workers are most vulnerable to
 
04:49:48.270 --> 04:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
heat related stress and to possible
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
death as a result which of our urban
 
04:49:53.390 --> 04:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
populations are most uh affected by heat
 
04:49:56.190 --> 04:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
Islands or by congregate air pollution
 
04:49:59.230 --> 04:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
do we how do rural seniors cope uh when
 
04:50:01.230 --> 04:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
weather events prevent their caregivers
 
04:50:03.868 --> 04:50:03.878 align:start position:0%
from supporting them so we need data on
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
strategies which are most effective and
 
04:50:07.948 --> 04:50:07.958 align:start position:0%
cost effective we don't have endless
 
04:50:10.310 --> 04:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
resources stop wrapping up please okay I
 
04:50:12.350 --> 04:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
will start start winding up so data is
 
04:50:14.788 --> 04:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
one of our needs our other need is for
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
uh Avenues to disseminate strategies
 
04:50:20.708 --> 04:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
that we know work and information so
 
04:50:22.830 --> 04:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
that people can protect ourselves we see
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
this office as um Dr Frederick said as
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh onepoint shopping so that there's one
 
04:50:31.150 --> 04:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
person who's in charge of helping to
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
orchestrate all these various activities
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
that are going on to protect our
 
04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
citizens so with that I'll wind up and I
 
04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you are there
 
04:50:42.070 --> 04:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:50:44.190 --> 04:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
okay I'm saying none thank you very
 
04:50:46.470 --> 04:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
much okay no one else has signed up to
 
04:50:48.310 --> 04:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
testify does anyone else wish to testify
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%

04:51:12.470 --> 04:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
back okay and know what was online L on
 
04:51:15.350 --> 04:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
and online was 49 in support six
 
04:51:17.788 --> 04:51:17.798 align:start position:0%
opposed okay very good thank

you all right if there's no one else who
 
04:51:21.750 --> 04:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify I'm going to close the
 
04:51:25.390 --> 04:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
public hearing on sp sp 496 FN and open
 
04:51:26.990 --> 04:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
oh well actually I can't yet it's not

together um because of the importance of
 
05:04:03.310 --> 05:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
the moment here so you will see that the
 
05:04:05.230 --> 05:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
bill as amended requires the Department
 
05:04:07.510 --> 05:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services to submit a
 
05:04:11.110 --> 05:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
a report uh To Us by November 1st and

potential actions to protect and expand
 
05:04:21.510 --> 05:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
access to mistone and mistol identifying
 
05:04:23.390 --> 05:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
ways to increase Outreach and education
 
05:04:26.190 --> 05:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
about access to mistone and M mistol
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
Mile prol and identifying barriers to
 
05:04:32.150 --> 05:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
protecting or expanding access to these
 
05:04:34.708 --> 05:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
medications so if you don't know if
 
05:04:36.788 --> 05:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
you're not aware mffa prisone was first
 
05:04:39.150 --> 05:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
approved by the FDA more than 20 years
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
ago and has since been used by more than
 
05:04:44.230 --> 05:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
5 million people in the US to safely end
 
05:04:44.240 --> 05:04:44.948 align:start position:0%
5 million people in the US to safely end
their

05:04:44.948 --> 05:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
pregnancies the legislature of the State
 
05:04:49.230 --> 05:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has actually recognized
 
05:04:51.110 --> 05:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
already the importance of access to myth
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
prisone since 1991 when New Hampshire
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
was the first state in the nation to
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
adopt a state resolution urging the US
 
05:04:59.948 --> 05:04:59.958 align:start position:0%
Food and Drug Administration to allow
 
05:05:02.190 --> 05:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
clinical clinical trials of myth or
 
05:05:05.788 --> 05:05:05.798 align:start position:0%
prisone in medication abortions the same
 
05:05:07.510 --> 05:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
drugs used to produce a medication
 
05:05:10.390 --> 05:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
abortion are also treated also used to
 
05:05:11.788 --> 05:05:11.798 align:start position:0%
treat a miscarriage and I just want to
 
05:05:13.350 --> 05:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
be clear about that these medications
 
05:05:14.990 --> 05:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
are not only used in medications
 
05:05:17.150 --> 05:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
abortion but they are used in other
 
05:05:19.708 --> 05:05:19.718 align:start position:0%
situations to treat a miscarriage which
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
if left untreated can put patients at
 
05:05:24.270 --> 05:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
risk for severe infection future
 
05:05:27.150 --> 05:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
fertility or even death this method of
 
05:05:29.230 --> 05:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
care has helped ensure that patients are
 
05:05:31.628 --> 05:05:31.638 align:start position:0%
able to make their own private medical
 
05:05:33.868 --> 05:05:33.878 align:start position:0%
decisions and has expanded access to
 
05:05:35.750 --> 05:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care something that
 
05:05:38.470 --> 05:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
is in dire threat in this country but
 
05:05:40.470 --> 05:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately abortion medications have
 
05:05:42.390 --> 05:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
now become the latest Target by
 
05:05:45.470 --> 05:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
extremists to remove even more access to
 
05:05:48.110 --> 05:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
abortion care in our country if
 
05:05:50.110 --> 05:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
successful anti-abortion activists who
 
05:05:52.470 --> 05:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
are trying to eliminate access to medic
 
05:05:54.910 --> 05:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
medication abortion will be increasing
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
the chance of poor health outcomes for
 
05:05:59.310 --> 05:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
all pregnant women not just those who
 
05:06:02.430 --> 05:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
have chosen abortion I want to be clear
 
05:06:04.470 --> 05:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
that attacks on myph aistone are
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
strictly politically motivated
 
05:06:08.670 --> 05:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
instigated and funded by extreme actors
 
05:06:11.350 --> 05:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
to further their agenda to ban abortion
 
05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
birth control and other sexual and
 
05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
reproductive healthare Nationwide but we
 
05:06:16.948 --> 05:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
will not let that happen in New
 
05:06:19.948 --> 05:06:19.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not on our watch not in a Live
 
05:06:22.390 --> 05:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
Free or Die State and that's because New
 
05:06:24.788 --> 05:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has and continues to be a
 
05:06:26.948 --> 05:06:26.958 align:start position:0%
pro-choice State a survey from
 
05:06:28.948 --> 05:06:28.958 align:start position:0%
breakthrough campaign shows that a super
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
majority of granite Staters 87% support
 
05:06:35.310 --> 05:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom and 64% of granite
 
05:06:37.990 --> 05:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
Staters expect State elected officials
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
to protect or expand B abortion rights
 
05:06:43.230 --> 05:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
with that in mind last June my
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues and I asked Governor sonunu
 
05:06:47.110 --> 05:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
to take action to protect access to
 
05:06:49.270 --> 05:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
abortion and more specifically to
 
05:06:51.510 --> 05:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
protect access to abortion by joining a
 
05:06:54.350 --> 05:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuit to protect access to Mya prisone
 
05:06:56.350 --> 05:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
and by issuing an executive order like
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
so many other Governors did following
 
05:07:01.470 --> 05:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
the Dos case which overturned roie Wade
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Governor shunu failed to
 
05:07:04.868 --> 05:07:04.878 align:start position:0%
take any action to protect reproductive
 
05:07:06.788 --> 05:07:06.798 align:start position:0%
freedom in New Hampshire which is why
 
05:07:09.990 --> 05:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is all is so necessary I have
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully asked that you stand with
 
05:07:13.750 --> 05:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
me and other members of the Senate to
 
05:07:15.190 --> 05:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
protect reproductive freedom in the
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
granite state and support Senate bill 50
 
05:07:21.230 --> 05:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
567 um I'm happy to take any questions
 
05:07:23.430 --> 05:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
but there are folks behind me that could
 
05:07:26.628 --> 05:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
speak to uh the protocols for the use of
 
05:07:28.548 --> 05:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
abortion medications so I can defer
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%

drug so it um the use of those two drugs
 
05:08:04.590 --> 05:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
is a is a protocol in abortion
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
medication but there are providers
 
05:08:07.948 --> 05:08:07.958 align:start position:0%
behind me that could answer in more
 
05:08:10.430 --> 05:08:10.440 align:start position:0%

of hp56 7 just reiterating my comments
 
05:08:43.310 --> 05:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
of support given in January when the
 
05:08:46.430 --> 05:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
senate committee on Judiciary first
 
05:08:48.670 --> 05:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
received the Bill I'm here to relay an
 
05:08:50.270 --> 05:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
important constituent story for your
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
consideration there's an OBGYN physician
 
05:08:54.548 --> 05:08:54.558 align:start position:0%
practicing at Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
05:08:56.548 --> 05:08:56.558 align:start position:0%
Medical Center in lebin who is also
 
05:08:59.030 --> 05:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
professor at geel school of medicine in
 
05:09:01.310 --> 05:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
Handover and a resident there this
 
05:09:02.990 --> 05:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
doctor is licensed to practice in both
 
05:09:04.830 --> 05:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
Vermont in New Hampshire and has
 
05:09:06.510 --> 05:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
reported to me directly that he
 
05:09:08.830 --> 05:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
perceives the ongoing attacks limiting
 
05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
his medical practice in New Hampshire as
 
05:09:12.868 --> 05:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
a push to stop offering his provider
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
service in our state this doctor has
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
contemplated moving his entire clinical
 
05:09:21.350 --> 05:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
pra practice exclusively to Vermont
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
because of its more hospitable
 
05:09:24.830 --> 05:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
environment and this doctor feels that
 
05:09:26.990 --> 05:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
the laws regulating abortion care are an
 
05:09:28.990 --> 05:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
unfair intrusion on his medical
 
05:09:30.830 --> 05:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
decision-making which follow national
 
05:09:32.670 --> 05:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
standards of care and they're an
 
05:09:34.150 --> 05:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
intrusion upon his professional
 
05:09:37.350 --> 05:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
expertise this law have passed and the
 
05:09:39.750 --> 05:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
study committee when undertaken will
 
05:09:41.548 --> 05:09:41.558 align:start position:0%
provide this doctor an important signal
 
05:09:43.670 --> 05:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
of support that New Hampshire trusts its
 
05:09:46.590 --> 05:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
OBGYN providers and values their
 
05:09:48.868 --> 05:09:48.878 align:start position:0%
difficult but meaningful work providing
 
05:09:51.150 --> 05:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
vital access to abortion medication is
 
05:09:52.830 --> 05:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
an important part of his clinical work
 
05:09:54.510 --> 05:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
and passage of this bill will assure
 
05:09:56.548 --> 05:09:56.558 align:start position:0%
doctors like him that New Hampshire is
 
05:09:58.270 --> 05:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
serious about expanding Healthcare
 
05:10:00.110 --> 05:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
access and serious about giving
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
providers all the tools they need to
 
05:10:03.670 --> 05:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
practice their trade and serve their
 
05:10:05.548 --> 05:10:05.558 align:start position:0%
patients this would be an important
 
05:10:08.510 --> 05:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
moral Victory after recent attacks on
 
05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
their profession
 
05:10:11.110 --> 05:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
and um it would show that New
 
05:10:13.150 --> 05:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's legislatur are serious about
 
05:10:15.350 --> 05:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
putting people before
 
05:10:17.390 --> 05:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
politics second I just wanted to say
 
05:10:18.788 --> 05:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
that I've heard there's some concern
 
05:10:21.230 --> 05:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire DHHS may be limited
 
05:10:23.430 --> 05:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
in contributing to the study committee
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
work and compiling the commissioner's
 
05:10:28.110 --> 05:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
report out of a fear or some limitation
 
05:10:31.390 --> 05:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
by DHHS because um of the executive
 
05:10:33.868 --> 05:10:33.878 align:start position:0%
council's refusal to fund Planned
 
05:10:36.708 --> 05:10:36.718 align:start position:0%
Parenthood contracts as I understand the
 
05:10:38.708 --> 05:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
lb's fiscal note for the study committee
 
05:10:42.110 --> 05:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
bill is a total cost less than $10,000
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
and we know that's below the threshold
 
05:10:45.670 --> 05:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
for executive Council review on
 
05:10:48.990 --> 05:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
contracts while DHHS would be the agency
 
05:10:50.628 --> 05:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
compiling the report through this
 
05:10:52.750 --> 05:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
committee study they should not be
 
05:10:54.868 --> 05:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
perceived as avoiding a contractual
 
05:10:57.230 --> 05:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
review um by the executive committee
 
05:10:59.750 --> 05:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
because our legislature if we so choose
 
05:11:01.708 --> 05:11:01.718 align:start position:0%
will be the a uh and not the agency will
 
05:11:04.350 --> 05:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
be charged um with the intent for the
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
study and um how that would take place
 
05:11:10.030 --> 05:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
well below the threshold amount um by
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
directing that work so no General funds
 
05:11:13.868 --> 05:11:13.878 align:start position:0%
are to be expended for the study report
 
05:11:15.708 --> 05:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
as we understand it but rather federal
 
05:11:17.430 --> 05:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
funds and grants are to be sought to
 
05:11:19.230 --> 05:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
accomplish the goal so I urge the
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
committee please don't get stuck on that
 
05:11:23.670 --> 05:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
point lastly I'd like to share my
 
05:11:25.470 --> 05:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
support for the intended work of the
 
05:11:27.310 --> 05:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh we all know that the
 
05:11:28.590 --> 05:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of the United States is
 
05:11:30.510 --> 05:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing the FDA versus Alliance of
 
05:11:32.990 --> 05:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
hypocritic medicine and that case is
 
05:11:35.270 --> 05:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
pending um but it should be noted that
 
05:11:37.150 --> 05:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
many legal analysts anticipate that the
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
court will uphold the fda's authority
 
05:11:42.548 --> 05:11:42.558 align:start position:0%
and continues to make myristol access
 
05:11:44.788 --> 05:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
legal uh regardless of that ruling
 
05:11:47.030 --> 05:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
however the information gathering in
 
05:11:48.788 --> 05:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
this commit by this committee is
 
05:11:50.948 --> 05:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
critical and identifying the ways to
 
05:11:54.270 --> 05:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
protect and ex uh expand the access of
 
05:11:56.750 --> 05:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
both M mistone and
 
05:11:59.070 --> 05:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
misoprostol and the barriers to this
 
05:12:00.510 --> 05:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
same as well as the educational
 
05:12:02.788 --> 05:12:02.798 align:start position:0%
component for public awareness for the
 
05:12:05.230 --> 05:12:05.240 align:start position:0%
safe and effective drug giving pregnant
 
05:12:06.868 --> 05:12:06.878 align:start position:0%
people control over their bodies their
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
lives and their family sizes found to
 
05:12:12.030 --> 05:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
Grant sters fundamental freedoms and
 
05:12:14.548 --> 05:12:14.558 align:start position:0%
robust Statewide economy that's why it's
 
05:12:16.750 --> 05:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
so important so important to keep the
 
05:12:18.750 --> 05:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
bipartison bill as amended by the senate
 
05:12:21.150 --> 05:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
in its current form I just urge the
 
05:12:22.590 --> 05:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
committee please do not lose track of
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
that original intent um by perhaps
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
offering some sort of substantive
 
05:12:28.590 --> 05:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment changing the subject of the
 
05:12:30.750 --> 05:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
studies committee's work so for those
 
05:12:32.830 --> 05:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
three reasons I'd like to urge you to
 
05:12:34.628 --> 05:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
support the bill has been introduced to
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
your committee and I'd be happy to
 
05:12:37.948 --> 05:12:37.958 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have thank you
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative Seth k
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
05:12:42.080 --> 05:12:43.788 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
taking

05:12:43.788 --> 05:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
taking
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
questions these two drugs they're not
 
05:12:48.430 --> 05:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
over the counter is that correct I'm
 
05:12:50.350 --> 05:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not a physician I'm not aware
 
05:12:52.430 --> 05:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
of the prescribing information I do
 
05:12:54.190 --> 05:12:54.200 align:start position:0%
believe that you need a prescription to
 
05:12:55.868 --> 05:12:55.878 align:start position:0%
get it which would require doctor with
 
05:12:58.230 --> 05:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
and relationship okay thank you are you
 
05:13:01.190 --> 05:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
aware of any current roadblocks to
 
05:13:03.868 --> 05:13:03.878 align:start position:0%
getting access to those right now I I'm
 
05:13:07.110 --> 05:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
unaware myself I'm honestly curious how
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
difficult are are there doctors that
 
05:13:10.990 --> 05:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't prescri mean what do you know
 
05:13:13.070 --> 05:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
of that's making it difficult for well I
 
05:13:15.230 --> 05:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
just spoke of the largest barrier the
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court review case under pending
 
05:13:20.708 --> 05:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
review now so it's a potential decision
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court that you know that
 
05:13:25.310 --> 05:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
FDA approved drug is no longer going to
 
05:13:28.548 --> 05:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
be available so being able to study
 
05:13:30.628 --> 05:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
other ways to access life-saving
 
05:13:33.190 --> 05:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
medication U abortion would is just is
 
05:13:36.270 --> 05:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
an important issue um so I think that
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
does fall under the study committee's um
 
05:13:41.868 --> 05:13:41.878 align:start position:0%
charge in this instance and that you
 
05:13:43.270 --> 05:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
would you know that would be one of the
 
05:13:45.788 --> 05:13:45.798 align:start position:0%
barriers um that the specific drug could
 
05:13:47.470 --> 05:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
not be used anymore so you'd need to
 
05:13:49.750 --> 05:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
find you know potentially other options
 
05:13:51.230 --> 05:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
so you would say this is more of a
 
05:13:53.030 --> 05:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
proactive piece of legislation the
 
05:13:54.990 --> 05:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
problem doesn't exist yet but it may so
 
05:13:57.910 --> 05:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
we should we should do something now or
 
05:14:01.030 --> 05:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't uh couch it in that frame
 
05:14:03.070 --> 05:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
um I would say that that is one of the
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
current challenges I'm sure there are
 
05:14:06.670 --> 05:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
many more and there are probably folks
 
05:14:07.948 --> 05:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
behind me who can speak to the
 
05:14:09.548 --> 05:14:09.558 align:start position:0%
intricacies of that a little more in
 
05:14:11.270 --> 05:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
detail thank you thank you
 
05:14:12.670 --> 05:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
representative fedus for closing the
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
door by the way representative Leon and
 
05:14:16.190 --> 05:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
then representative Weber uh thank you
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you representative
 
05:14:20.310 --> 05:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
for being here um it sounds like there's
 
05:14:22.628 --> 05:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
an attempt to proactively deal with if
 
05:14:24.788 --> 05:14:24.798 align:start position:0%
the FDA doesn't allow the drug to be
 
05:14:27.070 --> 05:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
done here would it make more sense for
 
05:14:28.548 --> 05:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
us to look to what other states have
 
05:14:30.270 --> 05:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
done to be able to import drugs from
 
05:14:32.190 --> 05:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
Canada because if it's no longer
 
05:14:34.150 --> 05:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
available as an FDA approved drug here
 
05:14:35.708 --> 05:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
in the United States we'd need to get it
 
05:14:38.390 --> 05:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
from somewhere and Canada has those
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
drugs and their there is a process for
 
05:14:42.430 --> 05:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you uh representative for the
 
05:14:44.830 --> 05:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
question I I would say that any option
 
05:14:46.990 --> 05:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
on the table to increase Access to
 
05:14:50.190 --> 05:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
Health Care for Women in particular is a
 
05:14:51.470 --> 05:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
great place to start I think this
 
05:14:53.548 --> 05:14:53.558 align:start position:0%
committee um given that they'll need to
 
05:14:55.470 --> 05:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
be identifying barriers to medication
 
05:14:58.030 --> 05:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
abortion as well as um to expanding and
 
05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
protecting medication abortion and
 
05:15:02.230 --> 05:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
educating the public on that matter um
 
05:15:04.150 --> 05:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
is you know that would all fall
 
05:15:06.510 --> 05:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
underneath that umbrella I believe um if
 
05:15:09.628 --> 05:15:09.638 align:start position:0%
if the committee so choose chose
 
05:15:13.190 --> 05:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know whether or not Canadian
 
05:15:15.150 --> 05:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs being imported to the
 
05:15:17.150 --> 05:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
United States for this specific reason I
 
05:15:19.628 --> 05:15:19.638 align:start position:0%
don't know that that's um within the
 
05:15:22.430 --> 05:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill but um that would be
 
05:15:24.590 --> 05:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
up to the committee to determine thank
 
05:15:28.190 --> 05:15:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
Weber I was going to ask if you
 
05:15:36.190 --> 05:15:36.200 align:start position:0%
know uh being from Northern parts about
 
05:15:40.030 --> 05:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
parts of the state where
 
05:15:42.430 --> 05:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
uh prescribing Physicians or nurse
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
practitioners might be fewer and farther
 
05:15:46.548 --> 05:15:46.558 align:start position:0%
between than they are here in
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
conquer um and uh availability at
 
05:15:52.708 --> 05:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
pharmacies and things like that might be
 
05:15:56.110 --> 05:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
currently an issue uh just given our
 
05:15:59.510 --> 05:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
provider issues and if that's better a
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
question for me to ask somebody else
 
05:16:03.470 --> 05:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
just declin to answer and I'll hold on
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
to it thank you for the question
 
05:16:06.788 --> 05:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
representative and uh what I can tell
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
you anecdotally is that yes I I recently
 
05:16:12.510 --> 05:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
attended the retirement party of a
 
05:16:15.190 --> 05:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
senior member of the OBGYN surgical
 
05:16:18.590 --> 05:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
Department um who was hired hired many
 
05:16:21.868 --> 05:16:21.878 align:start position:0%
many years ago of course and was trained
 
05:16:24.150 --> 05:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
um to handle some of the most complex
 
05:16:27.150 --> 05:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
pregnancy uh cases and um surgical cases
 
05:16:30.430 --> 05:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
for OBGYN issues in the state um and
 
05:16:32.110 --> 05:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
upon his retirement there was no one
 
05:16:34.150 --> 05:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
adequately trained in the state to be
 
05:16:36.150 --> 05:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
able to fully take over his case load
 
05:16:39.070 --> 05:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
and patient load so I do know that you
 
05:16:42.510 --> 05:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
know we are seeking we are approaching
 
05:16:44.430 --> 05:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
um kind of a proverbial Cliff of folks
 
05:16:47.708 --> 05:16:47.718 align:start position:0%
who are retiring with expertise without
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
adequate Replacements in place now so
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
what that does is create a bit of a
 
05:16:56.310 --> 05:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
desert right for service areas um
 
05:16:58.910 --> 05:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
including um the service area of the
 
05:17:00.590 --> 05:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire because we all
 
05:17:02.910 --> 05:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
know that the tertiary care system at
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth stretches pretty far so um yes
 
05:17:09.310 --> 05:17:09.320 align:start position:0%
that is a continual concern we all know
 
05:17:12.270 --> 05:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
there's physician shortages PA shortages
 
05:17:13.868 --> 05:17:13.878 align:start position:0%
nursing shortages traveler nurse
 
05:17:16.390 --> 05:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
shortages and budgetary concerns that
 
05:17:18.628 --> 05:17:18.638 align:start position:0%
affect all this these problems as well
 
05:17:21.590 --> 05:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
so um of course the barriers are more
 
05:17:24.390 --> 05:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
than just um procedural we know that
 
05:17:26.750 --> 05:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
they're infrastructural barriers as well
 
05:17:28.150 --> 05:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the
 
05:17:30.830 --> 05:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
question other
 
05:17:36.910 --> 05:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:39.708 --> 05:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to to speak are Kayla
 
05:17:41.868 --> 05:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
Montgomery and Liz Canada from Planned
 
05:17:52.230 --> 05:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
England make sure you put your
 
05:17:55.910 --> 05:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
microphone thank you good afternoon
 
05:17:57.030 --> 05:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
05:17:58.628 --> 05:17:58.638 align:start position:0%
Kayla Montgomery I'm the vice president
 
05:18:00.070 --> 05:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
of public affairs for Planned Parenthood
 
05:18:02.030 --> 05:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
of Northern New England um so I'm just
 
05:18:04.350 --> 05:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
going to speak a little bit about uh
 
05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
medication abortion and then I'm going
 
05:18:06.830 --> 05:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
to hand it over my colleague who will
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit more about the
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case that we um just just
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
had oral arguments in um so okay
 
05:18:16.110 --> 05:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
medication abortion is also known as the
 
05:18:18.590 --> 05:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
abortion pill it is a safe and effective
 
05:18:22.030 --> 05:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
way to end an early pregnancy up to 11
 
05:18:24.868 --> 05:18:24.878 align:start position:0%
weeks or 77 days after your last Miss
 
05:18:27.830 --> 05:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
period serious complications happen in
 
05:18:31.150 --> 05:18:31.160 align:start position:0%
less than onethird of 1% of cases it's
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
safer than other common medicines if
 
05:18:36.150 --> 05:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's penicillin and Viagra at CL parent
 
05:18:37.948 --> 05:18:37.958 align:start position:0%
of Northern New England medication
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
abortion is provided at three of our
 
05:18:41.910 --> 05:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
four Health Centers so in Manchester
 
05:18:44.788 --> 05:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
keen and as of December at our Dairy
 
05:18:46.910 --> 05:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
location it is an option for some
 
05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
patients via tella Health as well with
 
05:18:50.830 --> 05:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
our trained and licensed
 
05:18:53.670 --> 05:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
clinicians now we say abortion pill but
 
05:18:56.070 --> 05:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's actually a series of five pills
 
05:18:58.750 --> 05:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
using two different drugs the first one
 
05:19:01.270 --> 05:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
is nephop pistone and the second one is
 
05:19:03.830 --> 05:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
misool so the patient will take one
 
05:19:06.150 --> 05:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
metapristone which blocks progesterone
 
05:19:07.510 --> 05:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
which is the hormone needed for
 
05:19:09.830 --> 05:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and and then the the patient
 
05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
will take four misael pills which are
 
05:19:14.030 --> 05:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
placed in the cheeks and this is the
 
05:19:15.510 --> 05:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
drug that empties the contents of the
 
05:19:18.670 --> 05:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
uterus so this combination the two drugs
 
05:19:21.470 --> 05:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
that combination is the standard um
 
05:19:24.190 --> 05:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
medication abortion protocol now
 
05:19:26.390 --> 05:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
medication abortion it is treated the
 
05:19:29.070 --> 05:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
same way as a procedural abortion in
 
05:19:30.868 --> 05:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
that the intake procedure and the
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
counseling are the same the difference
 
05:19:36.310 --> 05:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
is that a medication abortion the actual
 
05:19:38.708 --> 05:19:38.718 align:start position:0%
abortion will happen at home and a
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
procedural abortion happens in the
 
05:19:43.030 --> 05:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
health center over 5 million people in
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
the United States have used methone
 
05:19:46.868 --> 05:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
which has been FDA approved for over 20
 
05:19:50.110 --> 05:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
years and many um abortion patients they
 
05:19:52.628 --> 05:19:52.638 align:start position:0%
choose medication abortion nationally
 
05:19:56.190 --> 05:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
this number is 53% but at PPN the number
 
05:19:58.030 --> 05:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
is much higher it's about
 
05:20:01.190 --> 05:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
70% people choose medication abortion
 
05:20:03.310 --> 05:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
over procedural abortion for a number of
 
05:20:05.510 --> 05:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
reasons most commonly to be in the
 
05:20:07.628 --> 05:20:07.638 align:start position:0%
comfort of your own home or on your own
 
05:20:10.150 --> 05:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
schedule some people also feel it's less
 
05:20:13.390 --> 05:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
invasive but it is not for everyone it's
 
05:20:15.750 --> 05:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
a personal choice and that's why Planned
 
05:20:18.750 --> 05:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
Parenthood offers both options it's also
 
05:20:21.670 --> 05:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
important to note that um medication
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
abortion and emergency contraception are
 
05:20:26.310 --> 05:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
not the same thing medication abortion
 
05:20:28.030 --> 05:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
which is the subject of uh the bill
 
05:20:30.030 --> 05:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
today it's taken to safely end a
 
05:20:31.788 --> 05:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
pregnancy whereas emergency
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
contraception is one pill it's available
 
05:20:36.708 --> 05:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
over the counter and it's taken after
 
05:20:39.030 --> 05:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
unprotected sex occurs to make sure a
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
pregnancy doesn't happen so they're not
 
05:20:41.990 --> 05:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
the same thing an emergency
 
05:20:44.670 --> 05:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
contraception will not end a pregnancy
 
05:20:46.230 --> 05:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
and I'll turn it over to
 
05:20:48.628 --> 05:20:48.638 align:start position:0%
Liz thank you so for the record my name
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
is Liz Canada I'm the advocacy director
 
05:20:52.030 --> 05:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
of plan Parenthood Northern New England
 
05:20:53.230 --> 05:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
and Planned Parenthood New Hampshire
 
05:20:55.948 --> 05:20:55.958 align:start position:0%
action fund so uh the previous speakers
 
05:20:57.548 --> 05:20:57.558 align:start position:0%
brought up the Supreme Court case and I
 
05:20:58.628 --> 05:20:58.638 align:start position:0%
just wanted to give a little bit more
 
05:21:00.590 --> 05:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
context so right now before the Supreme
 
05:21:08.750 --> 05:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:10.830 --> 05:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
and organizations who have sued the US
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
Food and Drug Administration over its
 
05:21:16.230 --> 05:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
approval of mytha priston and the case
 
05:21:18.750 --> 05:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
uses junk science to allege that mytha
 
05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
priston was wrongfully approved by the
 
05:21:23.310 --> 05:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
FDA 22 years ago and what they are
 
05:21:25.708 --> 05:21:25.718 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to remove mistone from
 
05:21:26.948 --> 05:21:26.958 align:start position:0%
the market
 
05:21:29.150 --> 05:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
entirely this attack on medication
 
05:21:31.750 --> 05:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
abortion is a blatant attempt to try to
 
05:21:33.948 --> 05:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
pass the deao abortion
 
05:21:36.670 --> 05:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
ban the fda's approval as you all know
 
05:21:37.948 --> 05:21:37.958 align:start position:0%
being on this Committee of course
 
05:21:39.150 --> 05:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
applies to
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh drugs in every state so the case
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
would undermine any state laws or
 
05:21:44.990 --> 05:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
protections and would even impact our
 
05:21:46.548 --> 05:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
neighbors in Vermont who passed a
 
05:21:48.390 --> 05:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment and protected
 
05:21:49.868 --> 05:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
abortion in their constitution it would
 
05:21:51.990 --> 05:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
still affect that state and other states
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
like it uh if this ruling takes effect
 
05:21:57.030 --> 05:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
from the Supreme Court it will have
 
05:21:59.830 --> 05:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
nationwide impacts including here in New
 
05:22:02.070 --> 05:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire access to myth prone can
 
05:22:04.830 --> 05:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
become much more restricted this is an
 
05:22:06.230 --> 05:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
outrageous attack it's politically
 
05:22:08.150 --> 05:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
motivated it's instigated and funded by
 
05:22:11.350 --> 05:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
extreme anti-abortion actors and it's to
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
further the agenda to ban abortion but
 
05:22:15.070 --> 05:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
also to impact things like birth control
 
05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
and other sexual and reproductive
 
05:22:20.190 --> 05:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
healthare the consequences therefore go
 
05:22:22.350 --> 05:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
far beyond abortion care and it could
 
05:22:25.190 --> 05:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
also stifle medic uh medic uh medical
 
05:22:27.670 --> 05:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
Innovation my my apologies Abend the
 
05:22:30.110 --> 05:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
country's drug approval process and put
 
05:22:32.470 --> 05:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
every approved medication in the
 
05:22:32.480 --> 05:22:33.788 align:start position:0%
every approved medication in the
political

05:22:33.788 --> 05:22:33.798 align:start position:0%
political
 
05:22:36.150 --> 05:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
crosshairs so the Supreme Court as Kayla
 
05:22:37.470 --> 05:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
just mentioned the Supreme Court just
 
05:22:40.230 --> 05:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
had oral arguments two weeks ago on this
 
05:22:42.670 --> 05:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
case we expect a decision to come out by
 
05:22:44.750 --> 05:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
the end of June which is very similar to
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
the timeline we saw two years ago when
 
05:22:48.788 --> 05:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court overturned Robie Wade
 
05:22:50.190 --> 05:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
ending the federal constitutional
 
05:22:52.788 --> 05:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
protection for the right to abortion um
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
so the bill in front of you Senate Bill
 
05:22:56.708 --> 05:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
567 I heard the prime sponsor bring this
 
05:23:00.030 --> 05:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
up this was a bipartisan floor amendment
 
05:23:02.830 --> 05:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
in the Senate it passed on a Voice vote
 
05:23:04.470 --> 05:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
it was you know strongly supported in
 
05:23:07.230 --> 05:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
that way it directs the Department of
 
05:23:08.948 --> 05:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to issue a
 
05:23:11.110 --> 05:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
report to show accessibility
 
05:23:13.030 --> 05:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities to protect access and
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
potential barriers that exist in New
 
05:23:17.590 --> 05:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so we urge you to vote all
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
to pass on Senate Bill
 
05:23:22.910 --> 05:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
567 thank you any questions
 
05:23:25.270 --> 05:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King thank you Mr
 
05:23:27.150 --> 05:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking questions do
 
05:23:29.070 --> 05:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
you know where these two drugs are
 
05:23:32.708 --> 05:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
States I'm not sure but they are
 
05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
distributed in the United States our
 
05:23:37.628 --> 05:23:37.638 align:start position:0%
distributor is United States based
 
05:23:37.638 --> 05:23:38.990 align:start position:0%
distributor is United States based
followup

05:23:38.990 --> 05:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
followup
 
05:23:41.948 --> 05:23:41.958 align:start position:0%
follow uh if they were banned at the
 
05:23:45.548 --> 05:23:45.558 align:start position:0%
federal level um do you believe that
 
05:23:47.708 --> 05:23:47.718 align:start position:0%
like cannabis these drugs could be
 
05:23:49.150 --> 05:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
produced in the United States and
 
05:23:52.670 --> 05:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
continue to be distributed uh
 
05:23:54.830 --> 05:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide that feels like a little bit
 
05:23:57.548 --> 05:23:57.558 align:start position:0%
over my pay grade um I will say that
 
05:23:59.350 --> 05:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood of course follows the
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
laws of where we operate so we are main
 
05:24:03.430 --> 05:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont New Hampshire we follow the laws
 
05:24:05.750 --> 05:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so if that is something
 
05:24:07.150 --> 05:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire wanted
 
05:24:08.750 --> 05:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
to do and it was within the law then we
 
05:24:11.470 --> 05:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
would do that but we certainly wouldn't
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
go outside of the realm of the State of
 
05:24:16.948 --> 05:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire what about federal law I
 
05:24:19.310 --> 05:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
mean I I'd have to see what that would
 
05:24:20.868 --> 05:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
look like I don't and the other
 
05:24:22.628 --> 05:24:22.638 align:start position:0%
clarification is this case is about the
 
05:24:24.830 --> 05:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
approval through the FDA process so it's
 
05:24:26.510 --> 05:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
not about manufacturing it it's about
 
05:24:28.868 --> 05:24:28.878 align:start position:0%
how it is approved and so one of the
 
05:24:30.350 --> 05:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
potential outcomes of this case is it
 
05:24:32.430 --> 05:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
rolls it back to when it can be
 
05:24:34.628 --> 05:24:34.638 align:start position:0%
prescribed for for pregnancy so right
 
05:24:36.830 --> 05:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
now as Kayla said earlier it's up to the
 
05:24:38.430 --> 05:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
11th week they could roll that back and
 
05:24:39.788 --> 05:24:39.798 align:start position:0%
say well you can't use it unless it's up
 
05:24:42.628 --> 05:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
to you know an earlier week than that so
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's really about the approval process
 
05:24:46.510 --> 05:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
itself through the FDA thanks
 
05:24:48.590 --> 05:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you Mr
 
05:24:51.310 --> 05:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for that that is
 
05:24:54.030 --> 05:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
very interesting so if they remove the
 
05:24:55.990 --> 05:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
approval for it for abortion would it
 
05:24:57.628 --> 05:24:57.638 align:start position:0%
remain approved for other uses in the
 
05:24:57.638 --> 05:25:00.270 align:start position:0%
remain approved for other uses in the
United

05:25:00.270 --> 05:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
States that's an excellent question I
 
05:25:03.390 --> 05:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
think that's a question that we're all
 
05:25:05.070 --> 05:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
wondering as we wait for the Supreme
 
05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
Court decision to come out sorry if I
 
05:25:09.548 --> 05:25:09.558 align:start position:0%
can follow up is there an approval for
 
05:25:12.270 --> 05:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
it other for any other use other than
 
05:25:14.788 --> 05:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
abortion in the United States and if
 
05:25:17.030 --> 05:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's not would having a pathway to
 
05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
import it from Canada or another state
 
05:25:21.708 --> 05:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
be a high priority so that we can
 
05:25:24.430 --> 05:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
maintain access to it because if it is
 
05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
approved for another use in the United
 
05:25:29.628 --> 05:25:29.638 align:start position:0%
States we passed a bill um last term
 
05:25:31.948 --> 05:25:31.958 align:start position:0%
that allows for off Lael prescribing
 
05:25:34.070 --> 05:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
within the state so if these drugs
 
05:25:35.948 --> 05:25:35.958 align:start position:0%
remain approved for other uses the fact
 
05:25:37.830 --> 05:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
that it's not approved for abortion
 
05:25:40.510 --> 05:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
would not have an impact on it wouldn't
 
05:25:41.948 --> 05:25:41.958 align:start position:0%
have an impact on doctors in New
 
05:25:43.590 --> 05:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because they are protected for
 
05:25:45.548 --> 05:25:45.558 align:start position:0%
prescribing for an off Lael use as long
 
05:25:48.430 --> 05:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
as they have informed consent so is is
 
05:25:50.670 --> 05:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining access to these drugs the
 
05:25:53.470 --> 05:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
primary goal and therefore looking at
 
05:25:55.510 --> 05:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
any path whether through off Lael use or
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
through importation from Canada the
 
05:26:01.270 --> 05:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:04.628 --> 05:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
you so again this we don't know what the
 
05:26:07.230 --> 05:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's going to say
 
05:26:09.990 --> 05:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
um I listen you know we listen to oral
 
05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
arguments I don't think that is
 
05:26:12.628 --> 05:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily something that was brought
 
05:26:15.230 --> 05:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
up um but we know that whatever happens
 
05:26:16.390 --> 05:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
at the Supreme Court it's going to
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
affect every single state so regardless
 
05:26:22.390 --> 05:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
of um off Lael use in in New Hampshire
 
05:26:25.310 --> 05:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to affect the whole country
 
05:26:29.270 --> 05:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
so um I think we don't know I guess it's
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
the short
 
05:26:33.590 --> 05:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
answer uh representative Weber and then
 
05:26:35.270 --> 05:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative Seth
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
King that brings up a follow-up question
 
05:26:41.910 --> 05:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
for for me and and um uh if you know it
 
05:26:44.948 --> 05:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
may may also be above your pay grade
 
05:26:49.110 --> 05:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
but if the approval is rolled
 
05:26:49.120 --> 05:26:50.948 align:start position:0%
but if the approval is rolled
back

05:26:50.948 --> 05:26:50.958 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:26:55.830 --> 05:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
um is importation from Canada then even
 
05:27:00.548 --> 05:27:00.558 align:start position:0%
legal um absent a prescriber in Canada
 
05:27:03.270 --> 05:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
who is willing to prescribe in
 
05:27:07.708 --> 05:27:07.718 align:start position:0%
Canada and yeah here because Physicians
 
05:27:08.910 --> 05:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
if there's
 
05:27:13.230 --> 05:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
prohibition on physician
 
05:27:16.708 --> 05:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
prescription um setting aside the issue
 
05:27:19.150 --> 05:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
of of our own local laws because the
 
05:27:21.830 --> 05:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court controls over that um is
 
05:27:24.788 --> 05:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
it even legal to get supplies from
 
05:27:27.270 --> 05:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
elsewhere yeah I I understand that
 
05:27:28.868 --> 05:27:28.878 align:start position:0%
question I think it goes back to Liz's
 
05:27:31.030 --> 05:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
point about the fact that it's not we're
 
05:27:33.150 --> 05:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
not talking about a straight band if if
 
05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
they roll back it's going to go back to
 
05:27:40.750 --> 05:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
the 2016 protocols and part of that is
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
going from 11 weeks to six weeks so
 
05:27:46.910 --> 05:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe the drug will be available
 
05:27:50.708 --> 05:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
for some people but it is a um it's a
 
05:27:52.750 --> 05:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
reduction of access so whether or not
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
you have the pills from Canada does not
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that we can prescribe
 
05:27:59.830 --> 05:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
them if someone is say seven weeks along
 
05:28:01.948 --> 05:28:01.958 align:start position:0%
you also want to just jump in and say
 
05:28:03.510 --> 05:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
these types of questions which are all
 
05:28:05.310 --> 05:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
excellent are such a good example of
 
05:28:06.868 --> 05:28:06.878 align:start position:0%
what has happened since Robie Wade was
 
05:28:08.350 --> 05:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
overturned right like the legal
 
05:28:10.868 --> 05:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
landscape and the chaos that's ensuing
 
05:28:13.750 --> 05:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
the types of court cases that are now
 
05:28:15.390 --> 05:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to go through and are in
 
05:28:17.310 --> 05:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy and so like all of this is an
 
05:28:18.750 --> 05:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
excellent example of like what has
 
05:28:20.990 --> 05:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
happened over the last two years and you
 
05:28:22.628 --> 05:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
know more to come regardless even with
 
05:28:24.788 --> 05:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
what happens with this case specifically
 
05:28:26.190 --> 05:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
representative Seth King and then
 
05:28:28.230 --> 05:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you again Mr
 
05:28:30.750 --> 05:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
chair you mentioned that your Dairy
 
05:28:33.110 --> 05:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Keen planned parenthood's
 
05:28:35.150 --> 05:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
offer this um where is your fourth
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood and why doesn't it
 
05:28:38.670 --> 05:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
offer those drugs thank you um it's a
 
05:28:40.310 --> 05:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
great question our fourth location is an
 
05:28:44.350 --> 05:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
exitor and um it's uh it just is not a
 
05:28:45.708 --> 05:28:45.718 align:start position:0%
space that we have available for
 
05:28:47.230 --> 05:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
medication abortion we are working at
 
05:28:49.110 --> 05:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
expanding um some other locations we
 
05:28:51.548 --> 05:28:51.558 align:start position:0%
just expanded a few in Vermont um but
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's just um it just hasn't happened
 
05:28:54.350 --> 05:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
it's not something you can set up
 
05:28:55.590 --> 05:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
overnight you certainly have to be
 
05:28:58.470 --> 05:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
training people it's cost money it's
 
05:28:59.910 --> 05:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that goes into it so we
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
would love to expand to our fourth
 
05:29:03.548 --> 05:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
location someday um but probably not
 
05:29:06.430 --> 05:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
this year representative Lon thank you
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh thank you so the um
 
05:29:11.270 --> 05:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court is that only for the 2000
 
05:29:15.910 --> 05:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.788 --> 05:29:17.798 align:start position:0%
approval because you just said that it
 
05:29:20.670 --> 05:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
would roll back to the 1996 approval I
 
05:29:23.708 --> 05:29:23.718 align:start position:0%
think she said 2016 the 2016 approval is
 
05:29:26.470 --> 05:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
possible okay so yeah there's
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
arguments and what we saw you know with
 
05:29:31.948 --> 05:29:31.958 align:start position:0%
the do's decision right like the the
 
05:29:33.510 --> 05:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
case that was first introduced was then
 
05:29:35.430 --> 05:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
changed into overturning roie Wade
 
05:29:37.868 --> 05:29:37.878 align:start position:0%
entirely so there are a different there
 
05:29:40.110 --> 05:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
are are many paths that the majority of
 
05:29:41.670 --> 05:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court could make but like
 
05:29:43.628 --> 05:29:43.638 align:start position:0%
one of them is rolling back to a
 
05:29:45.708 --> 05:29:45.718 align:start position:0%
specific earlier approval process
 
05:29:48.070 --> 05:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
another is removing it from the market
 
05:29:50.150 --> 05:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
entirely there are a lot of different
 
05:29:52.548 --> 05:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
decisions they can make um and so we
 
05:29:54.390 --> 05:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily predict what that's
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to be we just know that the
 
05:29:57.070 --> 05:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court the majority is not
 
05:29:59.590 --> 05:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
friendly towards abortion exess okay
 
05:30:01.110 --> 05:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so if it does roll it back to
 
05:30:03.270 --> 05:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
a previous approval based on our off
 
05:30:05.430 --> 05:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
label you will still be able to
 
05:30:08.110 --> 05:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
prescribe it so if it is only for the
 
05:30:09.708 --> 05:30:09.718 align:start position:0%
most recent approval that has had the
 
05:30:11.830 --> 05:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against it there is not a threat
 
05:30:13.830 --> 05:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
to access to this in New Hampshire
 
05:30:15.670 --> 05:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
because our off Lael prescribing would
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
allow uh uh somebody to prescribe it
 
05:30:21.230 --> 05:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
even outside of that six week approval
 
05:30:23.470 --> 05:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
process because through the off label
 
05:30:25.868 --> 05:30:25.878 align:start position:0%
prescribing law and the protection
 
05:30:27.670 --> 05:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
because there are data that are already
 
05:30:30.430 --> 05:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
being cited for this this would not
 
05:30:33.030 --> 05:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
impact access so long as there was any
 
05:30:34.708 --> 05:30:34.718 align:start position:0%
approvable use for these drugs in the
 
05:30:37.310 --> 05:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
United States so this is not something
 
05:30:39.830 --> 05:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
that is the same concern in other states
 
05:30:41.270 --> 05:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire throw our off
 
05:30:43.310 --> 05:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
Lael prescribing as long as it is not
 
05:30:45.230 --> 05:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
entirely removed from the market it
 
05:30:47.270 --> 05:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
still would remain useful and it would
 
05:30:49.590 --> 05:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
still be remain lawful for it to be
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
prescribed because the federal
 
05:30:53.430 --> 05:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
government does not set which drugs can
 
05:30:55.788 --> 05:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
be prescribed it's simply an access to
 
05:30:58.230 --> 05:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
them it state law prevails and the
 
05:31:00.590 --> 05:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
medical boards Prevail on how it's done
 
05:31:02.030 --> 05:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
and this is already protected through
 
05:31:03.990 --> 05:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state law so I just want
 
05:31:05.470 --> 05:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
you to recognize that it's already
 
05:31:07.430 --> 05:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
protected a lot more than other states
 
05:31:09.750 --> 05:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
sure I I certainly hope that's the case
 
05:31:11.910 --> 05:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
and I hope that once the Supreme Court
 
05:31:13.868 --> 05:31:13.878 align:start position:0%
um rules that we can come together as a
 
05:31:15.868 --> 05:31:15.878 align:start position:0%
state and make that really clear I also
 
05:31:17.110 --> 05:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
want to add though that there are some
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
other restrictions that would they could
 
05:31:21.990 --> 05:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
roll back including tah Health um so
 
05:31:23.390 --> 05:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
that would no longer be an option for
 
05:31:23.400 --> 05:31:25.310 align:start position:0%
that would no longer be an option for
medication

05:31:25.310 --> 05:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
medication
 
05:31:27.628 --> 05:31:27.638 align:start position:0%
abortion other
 
05:31:29.868 --> 05:31:29.878 align:start position:0%
questions seeing no other question thank
 
05:31:36.830 --> 05:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:40.230 --> 05:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Kevin
 
05:31:44.990 --> 05:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
dandro from conquered representing
 
05:31:46.830 --> 05:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
himself and you've asked for three
 
05:31:46.840 --> 05:31:48.830 align:start position:0%
himself and you've asked for three
minutes

05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:31:56.830 --> 05:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
ahead and your microphone's already on
 
05:32:00.590 --> 05:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
they left it on for
 
05:32:03.070 --> 05:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman committee
 
05:32:05.190 --> 05:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
members my name is Kevin dandro I'm a
 
05:32:07.390 --> 05:32:07.400 align:start position:0%
member of the conquered Church of Christ
 
05:32:09.430 --> 05:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
their m agree with me on this issue and
 
05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'm also a law student at UNH Franklin
 
05:32:13.548 --> 05:32:13.558 align:start position:0%
Pierce School of Law I'm not
 
05:32:16.150 --> 05:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
representing the university today so I'm
 
05:32:18.030 --> 05:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
urging the committee to vote inexpedient
 
05:32:21.548 --> 05:32:21.558 align:start position:0%
to legislate uh this bill for quite a
 
05:32:25.390 --> 05:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
few reasons um the original object of
 
05:32:27.510 --> 05:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
this bill was to direct the Department
 
05:32:30.030 --> 05:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services to expand
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
abortion access and that is not
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be done in New
 
05:32:37.110 --> 05:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like we said we are very
 
05:32:39.628 --> 05:32:39.638 align:start position:0%
pro-life state it is completely
 
05:32:41.788 --> 05:32:41.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to involve the government in
 
05:32:45.310 --> 05:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
this matter and that brings me to this
 
05:32:47.590 --> 05:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
next point is that this bill that's
 
05:32:49.390 --> 05:32:49.400 align:start position:0%
amended because the first one couldn't
 
05:32:52.030 --> 05:32:52.040 align:start position:0%
pass this one is also completely
 
05:32:54.990 --> 05:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary the fiscal note has been
 
05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
reduced to less than 10,000 and there
 
05:33:01.470 --> 05:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
are so many Industries there's the
 
05:33:03.830 --> 05:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry and all of the
 
05:33:06.230 --> 05:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
whole abortion industry they have plenty
 
05:33:09.070 --> 05:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
of resources that could cover
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
even conducting more narrowly focused
 
05:33:16.270 --> 05:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
legislation or uh Media or advertising
 
05:33:19.230 --> 05:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
that can get essentially the same thing
 
05:33:22.190 --> 05:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
across that this bill is aiming to
 
05:33:25.070 --> 05:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
produce and essentially what you're
 
05:33:26.948 --> 05:33:26.958 align:start position:0%
doing is you're forcing New Hampshire
 
05:33:30.070 --> 05:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to pay for something that is
 
05:33:32.830 --> 05:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
quite unnecessary and that would also
 
05:33:35.670 --> 05:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
violate the New Hampshire Constitution I
 
05:33:37.948 --> 05:33:37.958 align:start position:0%
was recently told by members of
 
05:33:39.788 --> 05:33:39.798 align:start position:0%
committee even that the New Hampshire
 
05:33:42.270 --> 05:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution protects the minority and
 
05:33:44.310 --> 05:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
even if the majority of people do want
 
05:33:46.670 --> 05:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
abortion access you can't force the
 
05:33:49.310 --> 05:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
minority to pay for it especially when
 
05:33:51.548 --> 05:33:51.558 align:start position:0%
they have very reasonable and not
 
05:33:54.430 --> 05:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
extreme at all religious beliefs that do
 
05:33:56.548 --> 05:33:56.558 align:start position:0%
oppose abortion you can't force these
 
05:33:59.190 --> 05:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
people to pay for somebody else's
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
abortion that they find in their
 
05:34:05.350 --> 05:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
conscience just so morally wrong and for
 
05:34:07.190 --> 05:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
those reasons I thank you for the
 
05:34:10.868 --> 05:34:10.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share My Views today and
 
05:34:14.110 --> 05:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
I'm open to any questions are there any
 
05:34:17.390 --> 05:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative palaza thank
 
05:34:20.230 --> 05:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:34:23.070 --> 05:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
question uh maybe you're not the right
 
05:34:27.310 --> 05:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
question to ask uh about uh you're not a
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
medical professional but according to
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
your data do you agree with previous
 
05:34:37.470 --> 05:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
statement that uh this these drugs are
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:43.990 --> 05:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
women do I agree that it's safe for
 
05:34:47.470 --> 05:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
women um I I am not sure if it's safe
 
05:34:49.948 --> 05:34:49.958 align:start position:0%
for women but in my view it's not safe
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
for any of the babies that are being
 
05:34:57.070 --> 05:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
killed thank you other
 
05:35:00.230 --> 05:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you sir
 
05:35:00.240 --> 05:35:05.270 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you sir
thank

05:35:05.270 --> 05:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:08.190 --> 05:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Jason
 
05:35:12.868 --> 05:35:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:15.230 --> 05:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
life you've asked for four minutes sir
 
05:35:16.708 --> 05:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
if you could keep a closer the three I'd
 
05:35:19.310 --> 05:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate it all right thank you Mr
 
05:35:21.830 --> 05:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
chair my name is Jason Hennessy I'm the
 
05:35:22.990 --> 05:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
president for New Hampshire right to
 
05:35:24.868 --> 05:35:24.878 align:start position:0%
life which is New Hampshire's largest
 
05:35:27.070 --> 05:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
pro-life organization representing many
 
05:35:29.510 --> 05:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
pro lifers across the state I also have
 
05:35:31.910 --> 05:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
a PhD in computational sciences and
 
05:35:34.230 --> 05:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
statistics which is relevant to to some
 
05:35:35.830 --> 05:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
of the to some of this what I'm going to
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
testify on um
 
05:35:41.070 --> 05:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
in summary I we encourage you to vote
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
itl on this bill for three major reasons
 
05:35:46.030 --> 05:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
the first one is that this this bill
 
05:35:48.070 --> 05:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
would increase actual danger to New
 
05:35:50.788 --> 05:35:50.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pregnant women in two
 
05:35:52.990 --> 05:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
different ways the second one is that
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
this is really uh something that should
 
05:35:56.948 --> 05:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
be done in the private sector you
 
05:36:00.310 --> 05:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
know instead of the state finding ways
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
to advertise this drug uh and the third
 
05:36:04.390 --> 05:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
one is that this is really a solution in
 
05:36:08.750 --> 05:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
search of a problem so so first
 
05:36:10.270 --> 05:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh about two-thirds of women who have
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
had abortions report that they were
 
05:36:13.548 --> 05:36:13.558 align:start position:0%
either coerced or that it was
 
05:36:16.350 --> 05:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with their values 24%
 
05:36:17.910 --> 05:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
reported that their abortions were
 
05:36:19.670 --> 05:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
unwanted or
 
05:36:22.350 --> 05:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
coed so the abortion pill especially
 
05:36:23.948 --> 05:36:23.958 align:start position:0%
with tahal the way that the FDA has
 
05:36:26.390 --> 05:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
opened it it it makes that even a bigger
 
05:36:28.470 --> 05:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
issue uh I'd like to draw your attention
 
05:36:31.708 --> 05:36:31.718 align:start position:0%
to Brooke Fisk Brooke was 17 to week
 
05:36:33.628 --> 05:36:33.638 align:start position:0%
pregnant when she went to go visit the
 
05:36:37.030 --> 05:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
father of her child of her child and
 
05:36:39.230 --> 05:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
rather than offering to help raise the
 
05:36:42.310 --> 05:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
child he as a doctor had access to these
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
abortion drugs and slipped it into her
 
05:36:47.510 --> 05:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
tea and he's been thankfully convicted
 
05:36:50.350 --> 05:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
of that but this is just one of many
 
05:36:53.350 --> 05:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
examples where uh women have been kind
 
05:36:55.150 --> 05:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
of forced into the abortion or
 
05:36:58.310 --> 05:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
unknowingly forced and the more that we
 
05:36:59.788 --> 05:36:59.798 align:start position:0%
make this available especially via
 
05:37:01.948 --> 05:37:01.958 align:start position:0%
teleah Health where there isn't even a
 
05:37:03.948 --> 05:37:03.958 align:start position:0%
confirmation or not necessarily tele
 
05:37:05.230 --> 05:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
Health but over the internet where there
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
isn't even a confirmation that this
 
05:37:09.390 --> 05:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
person is Pres pregnant the more danger
 
05:37:10.990 --> 05:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
that we put women
 
05:37:11.000 --> 05:37:12.750 align:start position:0%
that we put women
in

05:37:12.750 --> 05:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:37:14.948 --> 05:37:14.958 align:start position:0%
secondly uh there is substantial
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
research that has followed up on the
 
05:37:19.350 --> 05:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
safety and the on the safety of the
 
05:37:21.788 --> 05:37:21.798 align:start position:0%
abortion pill and that research has
 
05:37:23.708 --> 05:37:23.718 align:start position:0%
shown that it is much more dangerous
 
05:37:27.390 --> 05:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
than than the FDA understood before and
 
05:37:30.510 --> 05:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
U I also heard some comments on the uh
 
05:37:32.510 --> 05:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court case that Supreme
 
05:37:34.190 --> 05:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
Court cases fundamentally that the f is
 
05:37:35.948 --> 05:37:35.958 align:start position:0%
about the FDA not even following its own
 
05:37:38.350 --> 05:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
safety protocols
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to get into that more
 
05:37:41.430 --> 05:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
if you
 
05:37:44.030 --> 05:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
wish so is that so the question is is
 
05:37:46.470 --> 05:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
that the kind of society that we want to
 
05:37:47.788 --> 05:37:47.798 align:start position:0%
live in where we're actually making it
 
05:37:47.798 --> 05:37:48.830 align:start position:0%
live in where we're actually making it
easier

05:37:48.830 --> 05:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
easier
 
05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
to um to force abortions on people who
 
05:37:53.470 --> 05:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
don't want
 
05:37:56.190 --> 05:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
them and and even so and if that is the
 
05:37:58.548 --> 05:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
case should we be spending a dime of
 
05:38:01.750 --> 05:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
public tax dollars on this I mean CVS
 
05:38:03.708 --> 05:38:03.718 align:start position:0%
and Walgreens and Planned Parenthood
 
05:38:05.708 --> 05:38:05.718 align:start position:0%
they all are in this business they
 
05:38:07.788 --> 05:38:07.798 align:start position:0%
probably know much better how to ensure
 
05:38:10.910 --> 05:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh access to it than we do as a state
 
05:38:12.430 --> 05:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
and also why why should we be
 
05:38:14.788 --> 05:38:14.798 align:start position:0%
subsidizing them with uh with with
 
05:38:16.190 --> 05:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
public service announcements and those
 
05:38:18.948 --> 05:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
types of things can't we do a better job
 
05:38:21.190 --> 05:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
can't they do a better job and I guess
 
05:38:23.190 --> 05:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
the last part is that the this is a
 
05:38:24.868 --> 05:38:24.878 align:start position:0%
really a solution in search of a problem
 
05:38:26.190 --> 05:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard that there actually is
 
05:38:28.110 --> 05:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
a challenge if the Supreme Court says
 
05:38:29.110 --> 05:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
that they have to go back to the
 
05:38:31.310 --> 05:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
previous safety protocol because it's
 
05:38:34.430 --> 05:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
safer um what are we going to do are we
 
05:38:36.070 --> 05:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
going to go against the federal
 
05:38:38.708 --> 05:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
government so uh and then the last thing
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
I just want to address is that we heard
 
05:38:42.590 --> 05:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
about a shortage of obese the biggest re
 
05:38:44.230 --> 05:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
reason we have a shortage is because we
 
05:38:45.910 --> 05:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
are we have the lowest birth rate in the
 
05:38:48.670 --> 05:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
nation um either lowest or second lowest
 
05:38:51.190 --> 05:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
I mean if you want more people who take
 
05:38:53.468 --> 05:38:53.478 align:start position:0%
care of babies and pregnant women you
 
05:38:56.670 --> 05:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
need to have more babies um second it's
 
05:38:59.430 --> 05:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
only a tiny minority of OBGYNs that
 
05:39:00.910 --> 05:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
actually do abortions according to the
 
05:39:03.150 --> 05:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
studies that I've seen thank you thank
 
05:39:06.430 --> 05:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
you are there any representative Paz off
 
05:39:08.110 --> 05:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:39:10.548 --> 05:39:10.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's kind of two
 
05:39:13.948 --> 05:39:13.958 align:start position:0%
parts so first I wonder what do you mean
 
05:39:17.548 --> 05:39:17.558 align:start position:0%
by FDI not ifda not following their own
 
05:39:21.948 --> 05:39:21.958 align:start position:0%
protocol and second part if I had it
 
05:39:25.430 --> 05:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
correctly there were 5 million
 
05:39:28.590 --> 05:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
applications of this drug so I would
 
05:39:31.110 --> 05:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
expect we are better understanding now
 
05:39:36.190 --> 05:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
uh if it's safe and what kind of uh side
 
05:39:38.708 --> 05:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
effects it can cause
 
05:39:40.948 --> 05:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative so the can
 
05:39:42.390 --> 05:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
you just remind me the first question
 
05:39:45.708 --> 05:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
was uh about uh FDA not following their
 
05:39:48.910 --> 05:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
own protocol when approving this drug
 
05:39:51.070 --> 05:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by by thank you
 
05:39:55.110 --> 05:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative so in in 2000 the FDA uh
 
05:39:58.628 --> 05:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
May approved approved the abortion pill
 
05:40:00.468 --> 05:40:00.478 align:start position:0%
under a protocol that is usually
 
05:40:03.910 --> 05:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
reserved for extremely dangerous drugs
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
where you want to have a compromise
 
05:40:08.670 --> 05:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
because you know something something
 
05:40:11.628 --> 05:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
like a a a late stage cancer where the
 
05:40:13.468 --> 05:40:13.478 align:start position:0%
the option of not giving anything is
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
actually going to be as dangerous as
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
giving this drug and it was approved
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
under that with no with with without
 
05:40:23.910 --> 05:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
really good reasons being given the FDA
 
05:40:25.468 --> 05:40:25.478 align:start position:0%
was challenged back in 2000 but they
 
05:40:27.230 --> 05:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
decided to sit on the appeal for 16
 
05:40:29.830 --> 05:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
years and then dismiss it and that is
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
the reason for this Supreme Court case
 
05:40:33.430 --> 05:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's really trying to get the FDA to
 
05:40:35.750 --> 05:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
follow its own rules and your second
 
05:40:37.468 --> 05:40:37.478 align:start position:0%
question you said uh there's been five
 
05:40:40.628 --> 05:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
million dosages so part of the problem
 
05:40:42.310 --> 05:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
is that we haven't had very good
 
05:40:44.628 --> 05:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
tracking uh so there isn't very good
 
05:40:46.948 --> 05:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
linkage between let's say hemorrhaging
 
05:40:49.350 --> 05:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
coming from the abortion pill and and
 
05:40:51.150 --> 05:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
actually visits to the emergency room so
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
the best research that I've seen on this
 
05:40:55.110 --> 05:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
did look at that they used I believe it
 
05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
was California Medicaid data and they
 
05:40:59.430 --> 05:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the number was
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
something like 15% of women experienced
 
05:41:03.868 --> 05:41:03.878 align:start position:0%
hemorrhaging um there have been some
 
05:41:05.868 --> 05:41:05.878 align:start position:0%
political attacks on this paper um and
 
05:41:07.750 --> 05:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
as a researcher I'm happy to talk about
 
05:41:08.910 --> 05:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
why it's very clear that these are
 
05:41:10.468 --> 05:41:10.478 align:start position:0%
political attacks but in terms of the
 
05:41:14.270 --> 05:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
actual research it seems it seems pretty
 
05:41:17.270 --> 05:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
straightforward well thank you for
 
05:41:18.830 --> 05:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:41:21.270 --> 05:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
followup uh I haven't read that paper
 
05:41:23.150 --> 05:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
maybe you know when when you're talking
 
05:41:28.070 --> 05:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
about 15% experience in hemogen my
 
05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
05:41:33.670 --> 05:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh um I I'm not a doctor but my
 
05:41:35.990 --> 05:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
understanding like every abortion will
 
05:41:37.830 --> 05:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
have some hmer
 
05:41:40.390 --> 05:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh are you talking about some extreme
 
05:41:44.190 --> 05:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
hammer or like what what those 15%
 
05:41:45.948 --> 05:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
represent so representative I'd be happy
 
05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
to send you the paper um my
 
05:41:49.708 --> 05:41:49.718 align:start position:0%
understanding from memory is that the
 
05:41:51.430 --> 05:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
hemorrhaging was it it had to be severe
 
05:41:54.070 --> 05:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
enough to Warrant an emergency room
 
05:41:55.948 --> 05:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
visit other
 
05:41:59.150 --> 05:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:42:01.670 --> 05:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
Shapero thank you Mr chairman and I
 
05:42:03.390 --> 05:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
apologize for coming in late I was at
 
05:42:05.110 --> 05:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
another committee so I only heard a
 
05:42:07.468 --> 05:42:07.478 align:start position:0%
little bit of your testimony but have to
 
05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
say what I did hear was alarming and one
 
05:42:12.070 --> 05:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
of the things that I I believe I heard
 
05:42:15.310 --> 05:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
you say was that a survey that you
 
05:42:18.750 --> 05:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
referenced said 2third of women who had
 
05:42:21.590 --> 05:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
abortions did not want to have abortions
 
05:42:23.510 --> 05:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
well maybe you could clarify that for me
 
05:42:24.390 --> 05:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question
 
05:42:26.788 --> 05:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative uh the the survey that I
 
05:42:29.788 --> 05:42:29.798 align:start position:0%
that I'm referring to found that 24% of
 
05:42:32.670 --> 05:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
women reported uh that their abortion
 
05:42:35.590 --> 05:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
was either coerced or forced uh and then
 
05:42:38.670 --> 05:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
another I believe is 43%
 
05:42:40.270 --> 05:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
said that it was inconsistent with their
 
05:42:42.548 --> 05:42:42.558 align:start position:0%
values and so if you if you add those up
 
05:42:44.948 --> 05:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
that's about 2ir of women who get
 
05:42:48.510 --> 05:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
abortions um weren't really 100% in
 
05:42:48.520 --> 05:42:50.990 align:start position:0%
abortions um weren't really 100% in
waning

05:42:50.990 --> 05:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:53.830 --> 05:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
them would you be able to get us a
 
05:42:57.230 --> 05:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
reference for the ab study or survey and
 
05:43:01.070 --> 05:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:04.070 --> 05:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
also well I it's not really a question
 
05:43:08.830 --> 05:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
so I won't say it thank you other
 
05:43:11.750 --> 05:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:43:15.868 --> 05:43:15.878 align:start position:0%
chair no one else has signed up to
 
05:43:21.510 --> 05:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
testify on uh the Senate bill um 567 FN
 
05:43:23.910 --> 05:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to
