00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
all right it being 105. uh i'm going to
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
some of these are pretty complex so it
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
could take quite a while we're gonna
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
take them in the order that they're
 
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.590 align:start position:0%
take them in the order that they're
listed

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
listed
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with 459 for the next
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
many many hours
 
00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
a place i don't really like being at we
 
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%

uh voting out anything other than maybe
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
sb 275 because it's not on the calendar

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
and um but other than that
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to prepare ourselves so that
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
we can have any amendments done so that
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%

the wednesday finance section
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
so if there are no questions on what
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and start a hearing on sb
 
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.589 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and start a hearing on sb
275

00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
275
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
is is there anyone in the audience that
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
so so uh representative irf
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
from your seat would you would you tell
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
us what you think 275 does and if you
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
it's basically an or
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
a fund
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
opioid at the opioid abatement fund for
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
what from which people can apply for
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
grants to work on reducing opioid
 
00:08:37.839 --> 00:08:38.949 align:start position:0%
grants to work on reducing opioid
abuse

00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the one area of the bill that i
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
question it's not really questioned it
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
but i think she may be maybe extended
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
is uh section three
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
that relates
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
it says it relates to the duties it's
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
actually changing around
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
who can apply for the grants
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
and on line 20 number 16 subsection 16
 
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.470 align:start position:0%
and on line 20 number 16 subsection 16
of

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
what is it uh
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
rsa 126-8 colon 86 i b plan b
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
uh says that public school programs can
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
apply for these grants which makes
 
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
perfect sense but it would seem that
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
that should be more inclusive
 
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.430 align:start position:0%
that should be more inclusive
of

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
these charter schools and other kinds of
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
educational environments since i'm
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
assuming that everybody wants to have
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
kids be able to get these
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
grants to help the students as it says
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
in services for students with oud and
 
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.470 align:start position:0%
in services for students with oud and
any

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
co-occurring sud
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
mh issues or who have been affected by
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
oud and any co-occurring sud slash mh
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
issues within their family
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
there are also a couple of little minor
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
um technical things like the word the
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
letters are they aren't in there but i'm
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
sure that's what's intended
 
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.030 align:start position:0%
sure that's what's intended
um

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
yeah that's it
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for doing that and um
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
division three doesn't deal with
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
educational programs and so i'm
 
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.230 align:start position:0%
educational programs and so i'm
unfamiliar

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
with what the appropriate term of art is
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
or should be on line 16. if we intend
 
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.670 align:start position:0%
or should be on line 16. if we intend
for

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
educational settings
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
greater than just the public schools to
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
be able to apply
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
i you know i don't know if the languages
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's described there
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh is adequate or sufficient
 
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.710 align:start position:0%
uh is adequate or sufficient
um

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
have any insight into whether the phrase
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
public school programs is sufficient to
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
include things like charter schools and
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
other educational settings
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh this is one that
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
ols i believe is working on now
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
for an amendment and that was one of the
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
issues they were going to address and i
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
think i asked them to include language
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh something like all public and
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
non-public schools so that would cover
 
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.190 align:start position:0%
non-public schools so that would cover
everything

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
so we can just
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
effectively recess
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
and while we wait for the amendment
 
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.069 align:start position:0%
and while we wait for the amendment
um

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:12.949 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh is there
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
any comment from uh the representatives
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
on the committee
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
okay okay so
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh i'm gonna put sb 275 in recess
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
awaiting uh the amendment be to be
 
00:11:28.959 --> 00:11:33.030 align:start position:0%
awaiting uh the amendment be to be
delivered

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
this is a an act relative to expanding
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
medicaid to include certain postpartum
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
health care services and making an
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation therefore
 
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.750 align:start position:0%
appropriation therefore
[Music]

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
so representative irf do you want to do
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
something similar to what you just did
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
on um 275 to give us an introduction on
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
what 2
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
407 does
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
so i think we have mr lipman here for
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
you you would be
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
available to introduce this bill and
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
tell us what you think it does and what
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
the department position is right
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
so let's do that instead all right come
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
on up please and uh we'll of course need
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record henry
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
lipman i'm state medicaid director
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:38.470 align:start position:0%
senate bill
407

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
407
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
fills in an important gap
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
for individuals women who deliver a baby
 
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.870 align:start position:0%
for individuals women who deliver a baby
who

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.069 align:start position:0%
who
have

00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
income level
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
just above 138
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
but below 196
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're only given 60 days
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
worth of coverage after they deliver the
 
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.949 align:start position:0%
worth of coverage after they deliver the
baby

00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
baby
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
many of the conditions um and this is a
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
fairly small population for our actuary
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of the fiscal note that's in
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
front of you estimated
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
571 women
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal year
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
23 would apply to this um i i noted to
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
kevin uh i think the chair you had a
 
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.550 align:start position:0%
kevin uh i think the chair you had a
question

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
on that what what the number was and
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
we've seen as high as
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
761 going back to 19
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
but essentially what this does is you
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
know within 60 days some conditions
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
such as mental health sud but also
 
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.710 align:start position:0%
such as mental health sud but also
cardiovascular

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
conditions don't not necessarily fully
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
been able to be taken care of i guess
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
from an equity standpoint and someone
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
who's has a little bit more income
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
whether they be
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
employed or in the medicaid program who
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
can qualify for granted advantage would
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
continue to have coverage or if they
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
were poor enough if you will below the
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
138 they would continue to have coverage
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
so it kind of filling in the donut hole
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
here of of coverage for those women who
 
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
only allowed 60 days of coverage whereas
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
um you know others have a full year
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
may i ask you a question please was
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
you refer to it as a donut hole let's
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
use the phrase for a moment uh did this
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
donut hole uh exist prior to the
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh are we essentially
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh expanding the medicaid program
 
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're doing we're
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
expanding the medicaid program is that
 
00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:31.030 align:start position:0%
expanding the medicaid program is that
correct

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
in part
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
but the what's what's new um the
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan of 21
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
provided for the first time
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
funding on a federal level to support
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
the the match to do so
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
vice chair has a copy of this map and
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
i've left others with uh
 
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.710 align:start position:0%
i've left others with uh
with

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
with kevin ripple
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
you know it's something that many states
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
both red and blue states are
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
are addressing based on the availability
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
of federal match that didn't exist
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
historically it's for a uh five-year
 
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:08.870 align:start position:0%
historically it's for a uh five-year
period

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
um i think the bill's been amended to my
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
understanding to
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
only run our if new hampshire were to
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
adopt it to that point um we understand
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
why that would be the case
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
and it's fairly small dollars again a
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
lot of the
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
the things that aren't taken care of
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
aren't big dollar
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
ticket items during that period but
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
they're important for
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
um the mom and raising the child um and
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're important for the mom's health
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
herself i think there's
 
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.829 align:start position:0%
herself i think there's
um

00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
in a mortality issue that sometimes
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
emerges in a subset of that smaller
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
population so if we're talking about 571
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
women in state fiscal year 23
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
a subset of them will
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know need services and um to
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
maintain their health
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh do you have a question representative
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
for the record can you go over the
 
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.509 align:start position:0%
for the record can you go over the
the

00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
three different
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
funding areas that you said there's a
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
doughnut hole so
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
so individuals who
 
00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:13.350 align:start position:0%
so individuals who
make

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
who have income above 138 of the poverty
 
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.150 align:start position:0%
who have income above 138 of the poverty
level

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
and up to
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
but less than 196 percent that's where
 
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.949 align:start position:0%
but less than 196 percent that's where
the

00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
that yes that would provide beyond they
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
would if you will equalize them to
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
others who have a little bit more money
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
could do you have any understanding i'm
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
just curious 196 is a
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
peculiar number why how did that number
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
get picked 196 instead of 200 or some
 
00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.670 align:start position:0%
get picked 196 instead of 200 or some
other

00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.629 align:start position:0%
other
um

00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.030 align:start position:0%
i believe
i

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
i well i can confirm this with you but i
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
believe it's historically what the sort
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
of the federal limit was that new
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire adopted i think sometimes
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
states have the ability to go up a
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
little bit higher or but this usually a
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
threshold amount and i think that was
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
for that particular one new hampshire i
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
think adopted the the threshold amount
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
that was in the federal program and i'll
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'll confirm that uh it's not urgent all
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
right it just is just an odd number
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
makes me wonder
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
or do any other committee members have
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
any questions on this bill
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
do you stated a number of 2019
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
761 cases is that the cases in the whole
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
or is that
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah so this is in
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
what we're projecting in the fiscal note
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
is 500 and um
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
500 i'm forgetting my number kevin is it
 
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.230 align:start position:0%
500 i'm forgetting my number kevin is it
506

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
506
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
561 i believe is the number in in state
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23.
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
um that's what our actuary in looking at
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
our enrollment is projecting would fall
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
into that
 
00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:12.710 align:start position:0%
into that
um

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
what i was just trying to um by talking
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
about 2019 what i'm trying to just bring
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
up that the number can fluctuate based
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
on the number of births in the year and
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
you know what income levels
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
people who deliver babies have so
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of our fiscal note
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
we did
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
add some dollars to um
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
the base 561 to account for that that
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
could be fluctuation am i do i have that
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
number right
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear that number 561 or
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
700 from a couple years ago that's the
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
number of women in that doughnut hole
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
correct that would give birth or
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
expected to give birth not the ones that
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
were expected necessarily need these
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
extra services over the following year
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
correct it's i mean like anybody else
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
with health insurance is only a certain
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
portion of the individuals have to end
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
up using the services
 
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.830 align:start position:0%
up using the services
um

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%

whitley i'm the senator for district 15
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
um and um the prime sponsor of this bill
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
and with me i have rebecca ross who is
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
the head of the children's behavioral
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
health bureau
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
and we worked together on this bill with
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
a few other advocates
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
for children it was this issue was
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
actually brought to me by the office of
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
child advocate trying to think about how
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
do we better serve our kiddos who are in
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
residential treatment and out of state
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
they're you know there are there
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
even though we are building our system
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
of care there continues to be kiddos in
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
um out-of-state facilities
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to get something that was
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
workable for our school districts
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
so under special ed law school districts
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
have certain responsibilities to to do
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
these assessments so it was very
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
important to have the department of
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
health health and human services and the
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
department of education at the table so
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
we didn't so we made sure that um
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know each agency had the appropriate
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility in here so you'll see
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
that the house did amend it
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the policy committee um to reflect
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
some of the changes requested by the
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
department so happy to take any
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
questions but it's really just trying to
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
better assess children so we can get the
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
right treatment for them and you know
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
do you have any testimony you want to
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
volunteer or
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
or should we just ask your questions
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
go for the questions
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
admit my ignorance out of the gate here
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
because this is a lot of education
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
policy and i'm not
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
steeped in education policy so
 
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.549 align:start position:0%
steeped in education policy so
i

00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
focusing on
 
00:24:02.159 --> 00:24:03.830 align:start position:0%
focusing on
page

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph three the new paragraph about
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with individual
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
individualized education programs
 
00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:12.549 align:start position:0%
individualized education programs
and

00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
this looks like a
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
this is just yes or no and so i know
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
where i'm going
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is make clear
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
that um the school district does have
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
certain responsibilities when the child
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
does have an iep but we're not expanding
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know what the school is required to
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
do we're just clarifying it within the
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
context of this required behavioral
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
health assessment
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
and if you may remember if you you know
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
of course education is not you know be
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
before this committee often but there is
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
federal law and then there's state law
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
with special education
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so so
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
so you're convinced this is a
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
clarification of the existing
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
obligations and that if i went to my
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
principal and talked to her about this
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
she'd she'd say yeah
 
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.269 align:start position:0%
she'd she'd say yeah
correct

00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions uh
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative irf
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
i will say i'm sorry i'm gonna take a
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
timeout and recognize that
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative walls has joined us um
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
and welcome
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
we we happen to be on the third bill of
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
the day 416.
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
we we have recess on 275.
 
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead mr chair i did want to say if
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
you look on page two
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
line eight
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
um about who can actually conduct these
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
fbas that language um
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
was actually requested by this by school
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
director to make sure it reflects who
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
actually conducts these assessments in
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
schools so we wanted to be reflective of
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
the practice in schools so it can be the
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
assessment can be
 
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.269 align:start position:0%
assessment can be
performed

00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
performed
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh by individuals who are qualified to
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
perform the assessment and there are
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
certain qualifications within medicaid
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
and that may include but it's not
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
limited to a board certified behavioral
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
analysis or psychologist and we added
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
psychologists because often
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
psychologists are the ones doing these
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative earth did you have a
 
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.630 align:start position:0%
representative earth did you have a
question

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
thank you taking the question
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
so can you tell me under what authority
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
an fba is required for every iep
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
special ed student
 
00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:28.630 align:start position:0%
special ed student
um

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's not required for every special ed
 
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.909 align:start position:0%
it's not required for every special ed
student

00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
by putting in
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
this new section 4
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
into that rsa this reference there 186-c
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
colon 7
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
that is requiring it no it says if the
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
team has so the iep team is made up of
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
parent teacher
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
read the entire class yeah has
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
determined if if the team has determined
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
a positive inter intervention plan is
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate after review of an fba ma'am
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
did you hear we just you just read after
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
review of an fba how can you review an
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
so so what i know of special ed law is
 
00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:10.149 align:start position:0%
so so what i know of special ed law is
that

00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
the this this isn't creating but it's
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
the team that determines whether that
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
so where are you putting this into the
 
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.789 align:start position:0%
so where are you putting this into the
law

00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
into our statutes
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
the statutes require those things to be
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
to happen for an iep which in this case
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
means you're now requiring an fba for
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
every iep
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
i i i'm sorry i don't read it that way i
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
don't read it as creating a new
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
requirement i don't know if you wanted
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with the department of
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
ed portion of it sufficiently to comment
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
on that i i will say that the department
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
of ed helped write this and so and that
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
is not how i understood it that's not
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
how they understood it
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay requiring an fba for every child
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
the commissioner seemed to have a
 
00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
different point of view and
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i guess nobody was here
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
from the department of education to
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
address that so we'll need to look more
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
is rebecca here today
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
for debt i i think i emailed her like
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
late sunday so it would be stunning if
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
you were here
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and get our amendment ready
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh yes you have the amendments that we
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
before the meeting would you like me to
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
hand out one or both of them
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
one one why don't you hold on uh hand
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
out the one that um we agreed we'd go
 
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.990 align:start position:0%
out the one that um we agreed we'd go
with

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
and by go with don't don't overread what
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
i'm saying it's the one that i said we
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
would discuss we haven't made any
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
determinations because
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
all right so um
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
so representative erf was just asking a
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
question and and we all acknowledged in
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
the room that we needed you so that's
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
why you're here so we're gonna we're
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
gonna back up and rewind and have
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative erv ask you the question
 
00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:16.149 align:start position:0%
representative erv ask you the question
sure

00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chair
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to understand it seems to
 
00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.510 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to understand it seems to
me

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
that when you put section 4
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
into rsa
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
186-c colon 7 which is basically the
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
requirements that have to be met
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
when putting together an iep
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
when you say
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
that if the team has determined a
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
positive education intervention plan is
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate after review of the fba
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
that that requires that an fba have been
 
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.149 align:start position:0%
that that requires that an fba have been
performed

00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
performed
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
the only way that an fba would have been
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
performed if it was performed for every
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
student in the iep which is where this
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
law where this new clause is going into
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um there is
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
language in 186c that refers to a
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
functional behavior assessment
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
r e
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
d e
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
t t
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
so 18 in 186 c it does discuss
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
functional behavior assessments and a
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
team will determine to
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
to complete a functional behavior
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
assessment if it is needed
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
based on behaviors or a manifestation of
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
their disability so
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
we had put this in that if it is
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
determined that they need a positive
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
behavior plan they would put something
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
in but this language doesn't say to me
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
does not say that it has to be done
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
and we said we referred them back to the
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
cfr that relates to all discipline
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
procedures regarding a functional
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
behavior assessment
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay the cfr is the federal law right
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes it is i have that in front of me as
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
well if you could refer to anywhere in
 
00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:04.710 align:start position:0%
well if you could refer to anywhere in
186c

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
186c
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
it talks about an fba that would be
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
helpful it's certainly in c colon 7 it
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
i i would i apologize i would did not
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
know about this meeting until this
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
morning so i did not have anything with
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
me i was across the hall at division two
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
so i do not have it with me i can look
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
it up and get it to you but i know that
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
you're on a time frame so that'd be
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
great if you could just get to this um i
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
did send you an email with all this
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
information in it as well this morning
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
yes i got it this morning and then i
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
went to division two
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
i'm so sorry we we're in a scurry mode
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't have this bill until thursday
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
and this is first time we've had a
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
chance to talk about it so so we're all
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
just kind of in a little bit of a scurry
 
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.350 align:start position:0%
just kind of in a little bit of a scurry
um

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
what would be the impact if we
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
just simply deleted
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh everything under
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph three new paragraph and
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
just deleted that whole section from
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
lines 12 to 23.
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
what bad stuff would happen what would
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
we break
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
if i were i haven't looked at this bill
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
in a while um if i remember correctly it
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
was requiring um that
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
pieces be put into the iep related to a
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
behavior plan and this would make it so
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
that it was not required that it was
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
only if the iep team determined that it
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
would be put into the behavior plan
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
into the iep excuse me so if the if they
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
looked at the functional behavior
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
assessment and said no this does not
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
impact them educationally it has nothing
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
to do with their disability they
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be required to put it in the
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
individual education program they would
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm so sorry
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
in 10 words or less what would we break
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to try to answer that one
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
the point of adding the clarity was to
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
make sure it was clear where the line
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
between the school district and the
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
department or dcyf or behavioral health
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
was drawn so that if it fell under
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
it would have certain things included
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
and if it did not it would be clear that
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
then it was
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
for dcyf or behavioral health to get the
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
functional behavioral assessment
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
consistent with what doe would be
 
00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:16.230 align:start position:0%
consistent with what doe would be
getting

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
okay but so there's no change in the
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and relationships this
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
is just a clarification that's what i've
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
heard i there is a change because prior
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
to this bill there is no statutory
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
requirement for dhhs to do any of the
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
functional behavioral assessments um but
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of confusion
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
um when the school district does it
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
what's included and what gets passed on
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
for kids who are also being served by
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
so mr williams if you could just shake
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
your head yes or no
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
does the department support
 
00:33:52.480 --> 00:34:05.350 align:start position:0%
does the department support
416.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's all right he just answered it uh
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
what i what i heard you just say is that
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
you have been in support of senator
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
whitley's drafting of the bill
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
but the department has not taken a
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um in principle we certainly
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
support the use of fbas when they're
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
appropriate however the department would
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
need the necessary resources enabled to
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
so i completely agree with what you just
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
said but one of you actually in the
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
senate testimony i remember who it was i
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
think it was well i won't say who i
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
think it was i'm not sure actually spoke
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
about the cost of these fbas and pointed
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
out that not they're not this is in the
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
senate testimony i'm referring to now in
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
the report that came out of the senate
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
that they're not inexpensive to perform
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't want to be requiring
 
00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.109 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't want to be requiring
every

00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
student with an iep to be having the fba
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
i assume that's correct okay correct so
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
if you could just help me don't do it
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
now but if you could
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
go through and explain to me um how
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know where the ruling where because
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
if i just read the very simple parts
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
that i read which is basically
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
186 sc colon 7
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
and then also 34 cfr 300 colon 530
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
um that whole thing f
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
none of that makes clear that in that an
 
00:35:35.839 --> 00:35:37.910 align:start position:0%
none of that makes clear that in that an
fba

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
fba
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
is otherwise required
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
is not otherwise required in other words
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
you're putting this into c7 which are
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
the requirements if i understand it are
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
the requirements for an iep the things
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
you have to do for an iep
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
so as soon as you put something in that
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
requires an fba you're in my world
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
you're adding that unless there's some
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
other place that says it's already what
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
she just was just mention that
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
only in a certain circumstance something
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
like that so if you just point me not
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
right now but just send me that
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
information i'd appreciate it it's
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
actually in the bill i just had a minute
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
to read it well um so if you look at
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
section 5 it says under
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
34 cfr 300.5
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
schools are required to conduct a
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
functional behavior assessment and
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
provide behavioral intervention services
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
any time a child is removed for more
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
than 10 days so it's referencing that
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's when we would do a functional
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
behavior assessment
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
um it is on line 16 of the bill on uh
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
number section five
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
exactly when they're removed yes
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
not when they're coded right so that so
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
that is what but
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
so then this clarifies more when we add
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
on section
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
on the back and number three when you
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
add that on it clarifies that if when
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
you look at that functional behavior
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
assessment you determine that their
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
their education needs that
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
positive intervention plan then you
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
would put those pieces into place
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
let me ask you this then so if you go to
 
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.430 align:start position:0%
let me ask you this then so if you go to
look

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
and there isn't one
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
and you just skip over it
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to read just a piece of the
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
lba uh write up on this and see if you
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
agree with it
 
00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:17.990 align:start position:0%
agree with it
um

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
the lba wrote
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
the department states that traditionally
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
the fba
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
has been used in education and specific
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
developmental diagnosis support the
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
department further states that if the
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is to broaden the fba
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
beyond its traditional uses and into the
 
00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
behavioral health arena there will be
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
likely a significant state cost the
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
department did not identify the extent
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
of any such additional costs
 
00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:50.390 align:start position:0%
of any such additional costs
so

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
would you say the intent of this bill
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
is to broaden the fba
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely in the context of
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
behavioral health treatment not
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
exclusively in education so for a youth
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
who may be struggling with behavior at
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
home or in the community
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
but is not at school it would certainly
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
be an appropriate evaluation to help
 
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.710 align:start position:0%
be an appropriate evaluation to help
assist

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
assist
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
in developing the plan of care for that
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
youth so it's looking outside of the
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
school arena to home community and
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
residential where children and youth may
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
be struggling
 
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.390 align:start position:0%
be struggling
so

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
dilemma that i wrestle with and i'll
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
look to my committee members to help me
 
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.430 align:start position:0%
look to my committee members to help me
uh

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh get myself a little settled on this
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
point it seems to me like we're looking
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
at a significant
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
increase in state costs and we have no
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
idea how much that is
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
right isn't that
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's sort of a fair summary of where
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
um with the amendment we have not
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
provided the updated fiscal note
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
worksheet we have one in the works and
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
we'll be providing that um i think we
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
can come up with a lot closer than then
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
no idea at this point now that we've
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
narrowed it down and identified the
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
scope through amendment
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
when might that cheat be prepared
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
because as i understand my deadlines i'm
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm done with this tomorrow afternoon
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then i gotta turn it over to the
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
full finance committee
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
we can get it to kevin when i get back
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's pretty good
 
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:31.910 align:start position:0%
that's pretty good
um

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on this i i i'm
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
about to show you an amendment we've
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
drafted but i want to have you all have
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to ask questions on this
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
point representative erf did you have
 
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.270 align:start position:0%
point representative erf did you have
more

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank mr chair so if on line 15 we
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
opened that line up with something
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
effective if an fba exists for the
 
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.550 align:start position:0%
effective if an fba exists for the
student

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.829 align:start position:0%
student
and

00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
would that work for you yes that would
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
what did you just say
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
on line 15 of page
 
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.270 align:start position:0%
on line 15 of page
two

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
if an fpa exists fb
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
exist for the student and
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
then you continue in other words if
 
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's essentially what you just said
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
from section v back in
 
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:19.910 align:start position:0%
from section v back in
in

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
section one was was doing so this would
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
just clarify that in fact the fba has to
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
exist before you
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
go and look to see if it
 
00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
go and look to see if it
recommends

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
recommends
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
and then i that makes sense then what
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
you all can
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
stay there um
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
mr ripple handed out an amendment
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh 1738
 
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.430 align:start position:0%
uh 1738
1738

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
1738
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
is an amendment that basically just
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
strips out this entire paragraph
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
i what what that would
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
would what we thought what i thought
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
that would be doing is just um
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
avoiding the significant state costs
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
where we don't have an estimate
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be able to wait and
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
get more detail on that
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
mr representative irf has suggested a
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
different amendment to make it
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
clear that if the fba fba exists it can
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
be used if it doesn't it doesn't need to
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
be generated
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
if if we did that amendment
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
would you would you all be in support
 
00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:29.750 align:start position:0%
would you would you all be in support
yes

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.950 align:start position:0%
yes
so

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
if we're removing section three that
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
references the department of education
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
in that iep language
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
that would not have any impact on the
 
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.589 align:start position:0%
that would not have any impact on the
dhhs

00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
estimates of costs that we'll be
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
providing because that would still be
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
the additional fbas through the
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.589 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
um

00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
i think i'll defer to rebecca on the
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
other part of your question
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
and the language that was proposed by
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative earth is fine with us
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
eliminating this we had put this in to
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
allow for districts to put language into
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
the iep if a functional behavior
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
assessment was done so if they
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
determined that they did not need one
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
based on their educational needs but
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
somebody from dhhs came with a
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
functional behavior assessment and said
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
we think you should look at some of this
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
information then that allowed the iep
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
team to look at it and say yes we could
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
add something to the iep because this
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
may start to impact them or we've it has
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
already started to and this is going to
 
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.829 align:start position:0%
already started to and this is going to
help

00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
us so
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so so mr ripple let me let me
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
ask you uh we've we've meandered a
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
little bit but we've stumbled upon a
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
different amendment
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
do you think what you know what we're
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
talking about and would you describe
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
what you think we're talking about back
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
well so what i've heard so far is
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative earth's suggestion that
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
on page 2 line 15
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
the new line would effectively read if a
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
functional behavioral assessment
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
exists for the student and the iep team
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
has iep team has determined etc so is
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
that the only change that you're talking
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
about at this point
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
i i think so representative yeah
 
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.670 align:start position:0%
i i think so representative yeah
yes

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
okay and is it your understanding ms
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
ripple with that language that we would
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
probably avoid the state cost
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
well that's the part that i'm not sure
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
about because it sounds like the hhs
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
do you all want to respond to that yes
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
this is creating a completely new
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
service for most dcyf out of home
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
placement cases and that's where the
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
costs would lie in the first couple
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
so i understood the amendment to not be
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
creating a new fba requirement
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
because we're going to say if it already
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
exists it can be referenced not that it
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
must be created to be referenced that
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
would be in the educational setting but
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
the bill is establishing an fba process
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
um behavioral health or mental health
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
system that would be a new service and
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
okay so so this is where i think we're
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
i don't want to i don't want to stir ols
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
up if we don't uh need it but so let i
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
do want to take a straw vote
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the straw vote i want to take is
 
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.550 align:start position:0%
in the straw vote i want to take is
uh

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
i i apologize for interrupting i just i
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
um on the cost i um i appreciate you
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
turning that around so fast um i did
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
want to just bring the committee's
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
awareness to the effective date it shall
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
not take effect until january 1st 2024
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
and that was at the request of the
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
department so they could you know figure
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
out how to pay for this it may be that
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
it could be well i don't want to put
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
words in your mouth but there are
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
different ways that this could be paid
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
for through um
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know a negotiated contract with the
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
managed care companies there there are
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
different ways that it could be paid for
 
00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:03.030 align:start position:0%
different ways that it could be paid for
so

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
you know i just wanted to point out that
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
it won't take effect for
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
a couple years to give the department
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
the availability the the time to really
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
cost this out if that gives the
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
i would add that it's it's the cost as
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
well as the workforce that there would
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
have to be substantial efforts to
 
00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
recruit the workforce to be able to meet
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
this obligation which is part of why we
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
asked for that additional time but we're
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
still going to have to identify a
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
revenue source in order to be able to
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
and it and again it's not required for
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
every child going out of home we also
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
did another amendment um at the
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
department's request saying that it was
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
if necessary so it's not required for
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
every single child who's going out of
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
home so we thought that was a reasonable
 
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.430 align:start position:0%
home so we thought that was a reasonable
agreement

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
and again you know if you're thinking
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
about the cost the whole backing up to
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
the whole point of this
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
is so we can save costs right we want to
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
figure out what the kids needs are so we
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
don't place them in a 30 000 a month
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
placement out of state in utah i'm not
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
saying that that happens but the whole
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
idea of it was there are a group of
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
children who are receiving out of home
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
care at a very high cost and if they can
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
be better served in new hampshire
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that's less expensive
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
with their needs met we want to do that
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
so that this is the balance here
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
i'm asking this respectfully
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
you're you're making some assumptions on
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
what we can do with an fba if it were
 
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.230 align:start position:0%
what we can do with an fba if it were
available

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we don't really have a
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
history with so so it is a little bit of
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
a hopeful guess
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
also isn't it well it's more than
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
hopeful i mean this was so our former
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate the head of she
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
was a nurse she has reviewed these cases
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
she knows the needs of these children
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
and it was her recommended
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation to do this so it's more
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about language go ahead
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
and uh represent
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
page uh page 1 line 16
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
and and that paragraph talks about
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
more than 10 days
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
removed from school for more than 10
 
00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.589 align:start position:0%
removed from school for more than 10
days

00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
is it is should that be removed from
 
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.510 align:start position:0%
is it is should that be removed from
home

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
for more than 10 days um that is
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
tracking current federal law
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's talking about the special ed
 
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.549 align:start position:0%
that's talking about the special ed
context

00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
context
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's just it's essentially just saying
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
what's in federal law
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
if if i'm not mistaken representative
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
weiler that relates to the section three
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
that i was talking about i don't believe
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
that relates to the section two does it
 
00:47:47.839 --> 00:47:49.829 align:start position:0%
that relates to the section two does it
correct

00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
so that was the uh the fba gets
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
triggered that impacts uh section three
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
and as long as we state in section three
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
that if the fba already exists then the
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
section three stuff will apply but the
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
part they're talking about now is the
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
section two part that's the part that
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
relates to dhhs correct and what they're
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
talking about correct thank you
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at um
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
at page one
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
line 21
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
where it's it says therefore this act
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
directs the dhhs to expand the use of
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
functional behavior assessments when
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
clinically indicated yeah so is that is
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
that the cost driver right there is that
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
the thing that that's okay correct so
 
00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.670 align:start position:0%
the thing that that's okay correct so
senator

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
yes sir i'm i have almost no time
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
and um and and i really need to see
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
numbers before um i i am comfortable
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
voting for this
 
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.390 align:start position:0%
voting for this
so

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.270 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
in case we don't get the numbers in time
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
what what i'm thinking we could do
 
00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.510 align:start position:0%
what what i'm thinking we could do
is

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
is delete this paragraph
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
6 on line 21 through whatever 24
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
from the house version and since it's in
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
the senate version we could take it to
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
committee a conference and that would
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
buy us time
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
to get better math
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
how how do you react to that
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh if that's what you feel like you need
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
to do to move the bell then you know
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's fine and i guess you know we will
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
i'll defer to you on strategy
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
um all right well
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
if we go to committee a conference it's
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
a partnership so um so representative
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
walner you have things to say
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
well i was just gonna ask um
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
when do you think you can have the um
 
00:49:51.119 --> 00:49:52.470 align:start position:0%
when do you think you can have the um
cost

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
for us sometime today is that was that
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
what i understood
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes we've done some preliminary work and
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
just need to wrap it up but we should be
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
able to get some ballpark numbers to
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
kevin today
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
i mean personally before i make any
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
decisions about
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
taking this paragraph out i would like
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh i think we've done about all we can
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh i i want to recess 416 and we'll pick
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
it up tomorrow
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll wait a second
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
just before we do could we could we get
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
some agreement or get a measure of
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
whether there is agreement on the small
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
change to line 15 because i think that
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
should be in there regardless of which
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
way we decide to go with the other
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
pieces so so what i was thinking about
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
that is that should if if we ended up
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
wanting to remove
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
section four
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
i'd rather do both those things in one
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
amendment because the amendment you
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
suggested didn't seem controversial i
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
completely agree i want to know if it's
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
let's confirm that it's not
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
controversial not do anything just
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
confirm here
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm good with uh representatives
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
amendment okay
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm becoming more perceptive and
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
sensitive with age i think
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
but okay so i so i i don't want to keep
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
throwing things at kevin and lls unless
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
we uh have a good cause so so so we'll
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
we'll recess 416
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
until tomorrow with the idea that
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
sometime within the next few hours we'll
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
get some math on this
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative edwards yes ma'am if we
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
if uh miss ross was able to
 
00:51:37.119 --> 00:51:37.910 align:start position:0%
if uh miss ross was able to
have

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
figures or some information
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
later this afternoon could that be
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
distributed to us before we leave here
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
today i i would love that i just don't
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
want to put any more pressure on them
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know uh so
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
the the sooner the better i think is the
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
case and and if we haven't recessed the
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
the whole work group today
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
since this bill is recessed i think we
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
could pick it back up if we get more
 
00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.510 align:start position:0%
could pick it back up if we get more
data

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
that brings us to
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
the bill i've been told i should not
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
call the omnibus
 
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.710 align:start position:0%
call the omnibus
uh

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
so the not omnibus build um
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh sb 430
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
has many many items in it
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
and uh representative irf over the
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
weekend uh walked through them
 
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.270 align:start position:0%
weekend uh walked through them
um

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.870 align:start position:0%
um
before

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
we get started with sort of the earth
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
driven discussion of this uh 430
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
do you all have any specific sections of
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
430 that you you already know you'd like
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's a big bill
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
i think this is why
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
it took hhs 11 and a half hours to go
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
have their hearings
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
i would like to not do that
 
00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:03.589 align:start position:0%
i would like to not do that
yes

00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
i i would like to see us focus on ones
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
that have financial impact
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
and not on strictly policy issues
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
i i i'm generally okay with that i i
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
just have not sorted these and so i'm
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm basically asking have you sorted
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
these into
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal and non-fiscal and do you have a
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
list of the fiscals you want to talk
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
about no but i bet representative erf
 
00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.670 align:start position:0%
about no but i bet representative erf
has

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
earth's pretty great so um so why don't
 
00:53:30.559 --> 00:53:31.589 align:start position:0%
earth's pretty great so um so why don't
we

00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
i know that he wants to talk about
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh paragraphs 3
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
6 22 and 55. is that right
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
that is correct and one of those is
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
policy but the other three are all
 
00:53:44.319 --> 00:53:45.270 align:start position:0%
policy but the other three are all
fiscal

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
are are there any other paragraphs to
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
add to that discussion not that i pulled
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
out a notice
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh 3
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%

you so you took this and made it a
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
formal amendment if the if the language
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
that you passed out was in your email
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
the other day that yes yes yes i have
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
that oh well let's do that then and i
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
also have today we issued a revised
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for the bill as amended by
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
the house so i'll hand that out on 4 30.
 
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:56.870 align:start position:0%
the house so i'll hand that out on 4 30.
yes

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to just do a general
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
overview on on what
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh amendment 1743
 
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
does to paragraph or section three of uh
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
of sb430
 
00:56:05.119 --> 00:56:05.910 align:start position:0%
of sb430
uh

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
we all know that we're supposed to do
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
ready aim fire
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
this this bill feels like a fire ready
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
aim um because we're gonna
 
00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.670 align:start position:0%
aim um because we're gonna
charge

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
that a pilot program gets started uh
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
just immediately is authorized to just
 
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.230 align:start position:0%
just immediately is authorized to just
go

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know the extent to which any
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
planning for this pilot project
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
has been done
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
so i the inserted language
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh which is a little hard actually if
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
you've got my copy of the word document
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
it kind of it may be helpful because it
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
the bold shows you
 
00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.750 align:start position:0%
the bold shows you
uh

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
what what changes got made between the
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
section and the uh this amendment this
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
amendment is just to replace all so you
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
can't really see what got changed um
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
i um
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
so so what i did was um
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
essentially say
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh that there should be a planning phase
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
and then after the planning phase then
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
the um then the people who are doing the
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
pilot project planning can come to the
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal committee
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
and ask for permission to begin
 
00:57:21.119 --> 00:57:22.390 align:start position:0%
and ask for permission to begin
execution

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
execution
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
i thought that might be necessary to
 
00:57:29.599 --> 00:57:30.870 align:start position:0%
i thought that might be necessary to
have

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
a more successful pilot and have us
 
00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.270 align:start position:0%
a more successful pilot and have us
understand

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.630 align:start position:0%
understand
better

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
i'll let you just read it if you unless
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
you want to go line by line on the
 
00:57:45.200 --> 00:58:08.870 align:start position:0%
you want to go line by line on the
changes

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
a a key item is on six where it's in
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
bold if the department determines that
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
all necessary coordination for the pilot
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
program has been sufficiently completed
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
the department may make a request of the
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
joint legislative fiscal committee to
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
begin conduct of the pilot program upon
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
an appropriate effective date the pilot
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
program shall not begin until approval
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
of the joint legal or legislative fiscal
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
committee so they could do that
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
very early in the in this process or
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
later if they need more time to really
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
feel like they've got their plan where
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
any thoughts
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
you still put the money in there
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh i think i think the money said it
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
would uh lapse if not spent right
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
so so the the funding is available they
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
can they can do the
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
so the fiscal committee would be allowed
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
or able to let them start because the
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation would already be there
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
and and anything that's not spent should
 
00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.069 align:start position:0%
and and anything that's not spent should
lapse

00:59:14.069 --> 00:59:14.079 align:start position:0%
lapse
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
is that is that clear to you and the way
 
00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:16.950 align:start position:0%
is that is that clear to you and the way
uh

00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
well in seven it actually does say that
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
the appropriation shall be non-lapsing
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
and continually appropriated to the
 
00:59:27.599 --> 00:59:31.589 align:start position:0%
and continually appropriated to the
department

00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
so we could have that redrafted with
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
that section removed if you yeah i i i
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
should have caught that i would want
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
uh representing
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
walls thank you mr chairman
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand why we're
 
00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:51.510 align:start position:0%
doing this
because

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
i and i don't know this is not my
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
bellywood i'm not familiar with the
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
details in this but in looking at this
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
nobody in hhs raised these concerns
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
a pilot program basically there's one
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
out there that they can sort of pick up
 
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
and not the program they can just pick
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
up and drop in it's been done elsewhere
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's not something that's novel
 
01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:14.470 align:start position:0%
it's it's not something that's novel
and

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
we don't need to try a pilot program
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
before we run the program because
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what the program needs
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
and and there's nobody here to testify
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
i'm i don't know i'm just asking
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
why are we doing it this way i i think
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
you've actually raised a very good
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
question you and i are both making
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
assumptions your assumption is a happy
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
one in that the they already know how to
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
do this pilot program from other
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
examples and they're ready to go
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
mine is the more cynical
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
having never seen a pilot project
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
get rolled out quickly and effectively
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
i just i'm just trying to make sure that
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
we have an effective approach
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
is there anyone in the department who's
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
able to speak to
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
the maturity of the planning for this
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
i also want to clarify representative
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
edwards i'm not making the assumption i
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
split the preface is by saying i don't
 
01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:09.670 align:start position:0%
split the preface is by saying i don't
know

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to look at it
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
analytically and think
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know if it ain't broke don't fix it
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
why are we trying to fix something that
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
nobody's come to us and said there's a
 
01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:19.030 align:start position:0%
nobody's come to us and said there's a
problem

01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
we're about to hear if it's fixed or not
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
so mr williams could you
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
yes uh john williams the director of
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs for the new
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of health and
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
services thank you
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
um on section three of the bill
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
that section actually was generated as
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
part of last year's legislation senate
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
bill 162 which required the department
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
to engage key stakeholders in
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
developmental services
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
to develop a plan moving forward to
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
address the issue of children who are
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
age 18 up to 21 who although in need of
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
developmental services are outside of
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
the school
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
districts for responsibility for paying
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
for those costs so this is to fill in a
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
gap for those services for that age
 
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.230 align:start position:0%
gap for those services for that age
cohort

01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
cohort
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
the plan was developed by working
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
together with this group
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
and eventually translated into the
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
legislation you see before you uh with
 
01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
the cap of 20 individuals that's what
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
the department estimates will likely be
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
the outside of the cap of those being
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
served with an understanding that there
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
would be a robust report that would have
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
to be developed and provided to both the
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
house and senate finance committees as
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
well as the policy committees on the
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
metrics before we take the next steps
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
oh i'm a man of fewer words
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
so you're saying yes this pilot program
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
is ready to go
 
01:02:44.559 --> 01:02:46.630 align:start position:0%
is ready to go
yes

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.670 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you it's been a joy working with
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
you for the last six years uh okay so
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
would you tell me uh tell us
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
it sounded to me like you just said that
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
you guys think that there's probably
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
only 20 eligible individuals to begin
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
with and and so when you pick 20 for
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
this pilot program that's nearly the
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
universe of the people that need the
 
01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
universe of the people that need the
program

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
did i did i mishear that or how big of a
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
potential population do we think will be
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
served once this program has established
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
itself as is effective
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
so pending this very important pilot
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
moving forward our department has worked
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
collaboratively to address the
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
behavioral rather the developmental
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
service needs of
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
children within that age cohort we've
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
been doing it on an ad hoc a one by one
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
basis uh the last i heard within the
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
last six months numbers were around five
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
or six individuals that we've recently
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
served however as you develop a pilot
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
like this the need and demand will have
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
to be reassessed as we move forward
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
because it could be
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
either a larger number of individuals
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
who may seek and need these particular
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
services the reason why i was capped at
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
20 was a reasonable number balancing out
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
as to what we expect to be participating
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
in the pilot program these are very
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
costly services and so there needed to
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
be some level of cost containment
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
and that we settled on the cap of 20.
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
could there be as many as 100 who would
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
need this program once we establish its
 
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.670 align:start position:0%
need this program once we establish its
effectiveness

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
we will need to further assess that
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
through the pilot itself to give those
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
numbers to you for a projection uh
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
around that there have been others
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
outside of the agencies who have
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
suggested higher numbers uh but what
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
we're seeing from the numbers that we're
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
currently serving we believe that we can
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
service at least those who are in need
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh at the present time within the
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
context of this pilot of a kappa 20.
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
so so we're
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
going to incorporate the universe of
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
known people who need this service and
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
that happens to be about 20.
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
i believe i suggested earlier that we're
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
working on an ad-hoc basis uh one by one
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
that the numbers were uh uh smaller than
 
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
that i believe i mentioned five or six
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
okay so 20 is probably a
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
very safe number then well assuming
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
you're going to have four years from the
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
18th birthday to the 22nd birthday
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to have those five you're
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay so so my concern in the in
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
exploring the 20 is if the population's
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
bigger then the future program's going
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be more expensive that's one point
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
the the second point was if the
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
population is bigger and we're only
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
servicing 20 i'd be worried about
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
selection to make sure that the
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
selection process was fair
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
and and not favorites
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
so so it sounds to me like i don't need
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
to worry about a really big program nor
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
that favoritism was used to pick the 20
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
eligible beneficiaries
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
all right mr chairman uh yes
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative walls um so as some of
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
you know i've been sitting on education
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
lately as well as in here and elsewhere
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
and one of the bills moving through
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
education is a bill that basically
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
expands services for disabled children
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 18 and 22.
 
01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:16.470 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 18 and 22.
and

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
i can get into the details of it but let
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
me just say that the way it's running i
 
01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.430 align:start position:0%
me just say that the way it's running i
think

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that you're gonna see a
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
hundred kids in this you're gonna see
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
much more than what you've got because
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
the bill basically makes it easier for
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
kids to continue to get services
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
through the school year in which they
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
turned 22
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
and there were two different versions
 
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
i'm struggling to remember the version
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
that finally came out of the committee
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
whether it was on their 22nd birth oh i
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
believe it was at the end of the term
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
that they turned 22. so that kids can
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
stay in the program even longer and get
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
services so long as they don't graduate
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
and if they graduate then they're out
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
but the belief is is that a lot of these
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
disabled kids would choose not to
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
graduate so that they could continue to
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
get services through the school district
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
to the end of the term where they turned
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
22. so we're talking the same age
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
population here i just want to let you
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
know that there's in other words they're
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
expanding services on the educational
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
side which may impact and lessen the
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
services on the hhs side that's what i'm
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you hey representative erf do you
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
do you have anything you want to add to
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
ah thank you mr chair um well i would
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
either delete it
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
or at least make the funds lapsing as
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to non-lapsing which they are
 
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:48.789 align:start position:0%
opposed to non-lapsing which they are
now

01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
that silence you hear is is me thinking
 
01:07:51.599 --> 01:07:54.630 align:start position:0%
that silence you hear is is me thinking
um

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
so i think i want to ask mr ripple to
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
just do a very simple amendment to this
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
yep and i i think that would be
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
accomplished just by removing the
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
sentence that says it shall be
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing because the default
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
assumption is if there's no language
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
then the funds will lapse
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
i i'd be fine with that so
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.679 --> 01:08:24.709 align:start position:0%
 
would

01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee be willing
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
to accept an amendment
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
that makes these
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
this 2.8 million dollars
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
lapsing versus non-lapsing
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
if you are in favor of an amendment like
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
that you'll raise your hand and then
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
i'll ask the opposite
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
but with the funds if if the program is
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
ready as mr williams seems to indicate
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
the funds could be spent immediately
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
the spending could begin immediately i
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't think they could spend it all
 
01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.189 align:start position:0%
don't think they could spend it all
immediately

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
right this is this is this is not where
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
you're gonna write one big check you're
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
going to uh dole out money on a more
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
periodic basis i believe
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay so the issue of lapsing versus
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing is relevant uh i believe so
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
um would you accept an amendment to make
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
these funds
 
01:09:19.679 --> 01:09:20.789 align:start position:0%
these funds
lapse

01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
lapse
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
as opposed to remain non-lapsing please
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
okay that looks unanimous those that
 
01:09:29.759 --> 01:09:31.590 align:start position:0%
okay that looks unanimous those that
would

01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
not want the amendment raise your hand
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
so so let's uh let's draft that
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
amendment and then i think we can
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
just just for confirmation if we had the
 
01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.189 align:start position:0%
just just for confirmation if we had the
amendment

01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
would you be in support of
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph three as amended raise your
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
with that uh we're going to close or
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's no we're not we are going to move
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
within 4 30
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
to s you want to go to 22 first
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
so why don't you do 22 because you
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
actually know it better than i do so
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
representative erf is now going to talk
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
to us about
 
01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.679 --> 01:10:28.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.430 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
section 22 and i'm doing this from
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
memory now i'm not looking at the bill
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
essentially it's redefining the term
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
personal care attendant
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
under medicaid rules a personal care
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
attendant is basically a home healthcare
 
01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:45.590 align:start position:0%
attendant is basically a home healthcare
worker

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
worker
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
and under the and i'm sure uh
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
mr lipman will correct me if i'm wrong
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
under the existing
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
and associated waivers
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
such as they are
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
family members can serve in that role
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
and be
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
paid basically
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
and there's some possibility that after
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency ends
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
and or additional waivers can't be
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
garnered and again mr lippman can
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
address this more accurately
 
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.709 align:start position:0%
address this more accurately
um

01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
there'd be a need for monies to continue
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
to continue that program going
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
and my suggestion would be just to let
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
the program end
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
and things go back to as they were
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
before this whole state of emergency
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
where family members took care of their
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
family members
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
as i i'm going to ask you to talk to
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
this mr libman but as i understand the
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
history of this
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
if we flash back about 10 years ago
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
people who needed at home uh care
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
had to go find a visiting nurse or
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
somebody like that and with
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
the shortages on visiting nurses and the
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
expenses of visiting nurses
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh it was it became perceived that it
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
would be cost effective if there was a
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
family member that could take care of
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
that member it was better to just go
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
ahead and pay that member to take that
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
family member to take care of the sick
 
01:12:22.159 --> 01:12:23.189 align:start position:0%
family member to take care of the sick
person

01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
because it was a good economic buy and
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
it helped strengthen families
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
and all of that sounds good
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
is that an accurate summary of the
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
history because then i want to keep
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
the record henry lipman medicaid
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
director in part it is mr chairman um
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
there's the the waivers like the
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
the home and kimmy based service waivers
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is also there's state plan services
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
which have
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
also have a component and
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
we find ourselves in a position where
 
01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
there isn't a workforce they're entitled
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
to the a benefit
 
01:13:08.719 --> 01:13:09.510 align:start position:0%
to the a benefit
if

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
if the family members don't step up in a
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
certain situation we could end up where
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
um the state has exposure or
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
kids could be
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
kids or others could be
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
institutionalized and
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
incur a logic expense what we're
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
proposing here is
 
01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.990 align:start position:0%
proposing here is
um

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
under the
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
as the vice chair said was under the
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
public health emergency we were able to
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
get a special waiver we're trying to
 
01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.790 align:start position:0%
get a special waiver we're trying to
negotiate

01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
negotiate
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
another way right now with cms we're
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
concerned whether we'll get in place in
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
time and we could end up having a cliff
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
and so what we're asking for is in the
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
event we're not able to get something
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
else in place is to have
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh monies available so that we don't
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
have a cliff we have some time to get
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
something in place
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
that being said you know to the extent
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
that we didn't use it it certainly would
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
lapse i just want to make that that
 
01:14:02.159 --> 01:14:03.510 align:start position:0%
lapse i just want to make that that
clear

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:06.950 align:start position:0%
okay um
so

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
with all of that in in place before the
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh i i still come back to my
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
concern i've always felt this was
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
probably a pretty good idea and it was
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
compassionate and it solved the problem
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
but i have always wondered because i'm a
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
cynical individual has anyone conducted
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
the due diligence to ensure uh fraud
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
protection is built into the program and
 
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
that we're actively avoiding fraud in
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
this program because it just seems
 
01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.550 align:start position:0%
this program because it just seems
susceptible

01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
susceptible
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
to the potential for fraud could you
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
talk to us about that
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
yes um i think in terms of the
 
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
amount of care that's allowed to be
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
provided that that's established in
 
01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.830 align:start position:0%
provided that that's established in
advance

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
advance
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
with a prior authorization
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
that in some instances here families are
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
entitled to private duty nurse a full
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
registered nurse
 
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.070 align:start position:0%
registered nurse
but

01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
there isn't a workforce to be able to
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
family members can fill in for for some
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
of it the non
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
the non uh board of nursing approved
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
levels of service where you don't have
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
to be licensed so the families are
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
getting less than what they're
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
if you will been assessed to to need and
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
what they're technically a title
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
entitled to so i guess in terms of the
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
the there's no more than 50 percent of
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
what is
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
is determined as necessary can be
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
provided by the family in terms of
 
01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.870 align:start position:0%
provided by the family in terms of
compensation

01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
second level is before someone can
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
take on this role they have to be
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
screened as any other provider
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
we use grant state independent living to
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
to if you will on board them like any
 
01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.189 align:start position:0%
to if you will on board them like any
other

01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
lna who might provide the services as an
 
01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.390 align:start position:0%
lna who might provide the services as an
example

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
and um they're monitoring you know to
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that the
 
01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
that the hours are documented whatever
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
and that what we're paying for is
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
actually been uh delivered but that's i
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
think we do have
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate controls here it's not just
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
you can decide to do what you want to do
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
as much as you want there's specific
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
has this program ever been audited
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
um well it hasn't been um
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
audited in a formal sense yet um but the
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's under our managed care
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
um structure and so that the mcos in
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
terms of processing claims have whatever
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
they would ordinarily do
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
we certainly will
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
demonstration if you will
 
01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.910 align:start position:0%
demonstration if you will
and

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
again my concern is what happens if we
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
just sort of
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
let go with no you know end up having a
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
cliff here in terms of what happens to
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
to these situations because some some
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
people have been in put in a position
 
01:16:58.159 --> 01:16:59.270 align:start position:0%
people have been in put in a position
where

01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
the a child's needs can't be met
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
um so they've you know maybe stopped
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
working um so that their child's needs
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
are met and then
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
so if we take that away they both don't
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
have employment and they're not getting
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
and i think we could end up with some
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
some concerns in terms of what the
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
state's position in terms of adequacy of
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
of care here
 
01:17:22.719 --> 01:17:24.709 align:start position:0%
of care here
question

01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
yes of mr littman
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
how many families are using this at this
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
time do you know
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the state plan side of it i think
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
okay mr chairman uh representative walls
 
01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.870 align:start position:0%
okay mr chairman uh representative walls
um

01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
i seem to remember reading a newspaper
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
about some families who had their care
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
cut off they were not being paid by the
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
states and they ended up staying home to
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
care for their disabled family member
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
and ended up having to go on public
 
01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:04.790 align:start position:0%
and ended up having to go on public
assistance

01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's are you aware of those kinds of
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
cases out there
 
01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
i don't have the those press accounts
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
but what you described is
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
likely could happen
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
i think is the case because you know
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
given the choice of
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
an example of a child who may need to uh
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
maybe um have a trach and need to have
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know regular care or something like
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
that with disabilities that they just
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
they're not in a position where they can
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
do nothing and so
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
that they could end up where you
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
mr ripple question for you
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
on page seven
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
line three
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
there is hereby appropriated to dhhs
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
700 000.
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing the word lapsing or
 
01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing so that means that the
 
01:18:55.669 --> 01:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
default is that these are lapsing funds
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
um is there are there any more questions
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative walter well i
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
did want to ask mr litman so
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
if a family um
 
01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:10.870 align:start position:0%
if a family um
did

01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
lose this reimbursement and they
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
had to make the decision that they would
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
have to have their family member go into
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
a state a facility that the state would
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
then be responsible for
 
01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.950 align:start position:0%
then be responsible for
so

01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
what is the range of costs for those
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of facilities
 
01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:30.550 align:start position:0%
kinds of facilities
um

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
you know you're talking
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
numbers that you know are more than what
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
it costs for a nursing home stay for
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
an individual you know depending on you
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
know like a child with that i described
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
it as you know
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
a trach dependent and
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
high medical needs it's
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it would reach 700 000
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
based on a number that would do there
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
but you know there's also i think in
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
terms of exposure
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
from legal standpoint in terms of not
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
meeting needs in the least restrictive
 
01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:07.590 align:start position:0%
meeting needs in the least restrictive
environment

01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.350 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
so can you explain what was happening
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
prior to the state of emergency
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
so i think the
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the workforce situation
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of number of lnas that
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
that left the workforce or went to
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
different spots i mean we lost
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
um somewhere i think it was reported in
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
the union leader um you know like 1500
 
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:29.830 align:start position:0%
the union leader um you know like 1500
um

01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
lnas dropped out of the workforce in
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
terms of providing services so i think
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
can comment with the
 
01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:38.709 align:start position:0%
can comment with the
the

01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
public health emergency covert situation
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
there wasn't you know there was always
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
some challenge but it became a major
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
challenge um
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of meeting meeting needs and
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
as it is today we're we're we're kind of
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
on the edge and i'm concerned about
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay so i personally am um predisposed
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
to approving this
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
but i would like to take a straw vote
 
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.270 align:start position:0%
but i would like to take a straw vote
and

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask it the same way if if
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
leaving section 22 and sp 430 as is
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
my recollection is we've always done
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
this to some extent
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
all right so uh we probably don't really
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
have any action on this because we're at
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
some point going to vote on 430 but
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
as a whole but we've removed the
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
concerns around 22.
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
do you have a preference of which one
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about next
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to move to
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
item 55
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
is on page 15
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
do you want to do you want to start us
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
off do you want the department to talk
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
about this how do you want to proceed
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
well basically just yeah the department
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
come up it's basically this is
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
increasing medicaid reimbursement rates
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
for birthing services and it seems to me
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing we would do in
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh that's true i'd like to hear
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
about that and i'd also want to hear
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
about this 25
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
figure because that you know the at
 
01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.310 align:start position:0%
figure because that you know the at
first

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
glance that seems like a very hefty
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
percentage and then
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
you give yourself the flexibility to
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
give different rates based on different
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
geography and i'm just curious what this
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
what the methodology and thoughts would
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
be there
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
so you go for it
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
again for the record henry medicaid
 
01:22:55.199 --> 01:22:56.310 align:start position:0%
again for the record henry medicaid
director

01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
um this bill was originally senate bill
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
401 proposed by senator bradley
 
01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.430 align:start position:0%
401 proposed by senator bradley
there's

01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.709 align:start position:0%
there's
um

01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
and senate bill 401
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
the senate used that for
 
01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.189 align:start position:0%
the senate used that for
um

01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:11.910 align:start position:0%
um
in

01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
finance changed that bill to be the
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
property tax relief bill in terms of
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
some bridges roads and and this is where
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
they ended up
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
frankly where we where we are with
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
obstetric services in the state um
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
is we
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
we did not budget for this in um
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
because we had the the rate increases in
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 the two 3.1 percent increases
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
but just the the base in which
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
a berth is paid for is off a base that's
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
around two thousand dollars so twenty
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
five percent on two thousand dollars is
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about for a whole
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
um inpatient stay drg payment
 
01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.910 align:start position:0%
um inpatient stay drg payment
um

01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
the the reason that the department
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
strongly supports this is that we've
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
seen 10
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
hospital closures of obstetric services
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the north country in particular um
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're left with a very
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
small network that
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
has during the public health emergency
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
gopher had to come through with some
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
money to keep
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
littleton um afloat in terms of
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
maintaining their service they were
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
ready to drop it as well
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
um a result of finances
 
01:24:34.719 --> 01:24:37.750 align:start position:0%
um a result of finances
and

01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of what
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
losing like a littleton or
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
or berlin
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
in particular as two examples would
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
create a major geographic hole in terms
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.159 --> 01:24:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
we're already starting to see with the
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
closures that have already
 
01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.390 align:start position:0%
closures that have already
happened

01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
more unplanned out of
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
we're

01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're concerned that what this proposal
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
does is just it buys us some time to
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
work on a longer term plan because this
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be enough to do it and i
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
think what i've talked to the senate
 
01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.070 align:start position:0%
think what i've talked to the senate
about

01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
senate finance is you know the the large
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
sums of money we're putting into for
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
example rebuilding the mental health
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
system particularly in patient capacity
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
that once you lose this obstetrics
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
capacity to try to re-establish it and
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
it is needed both from not just a
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare delivery standpoint but if if
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
you talk to the economic development
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
folks in terms of the north country as
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
an example that
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
um you know without a hospital
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
delivering burst you you got your
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
demographics are set in a way that you
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
know they're already tough up there in
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
terms of just being an old population
 
01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.270 align:start position:0%
terms of just being an old population
so

01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
i understand why you'd prefer to see it
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
in a budget approach but i think we'll
 
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
be coming back in the budget you know
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
with hopefully a longer range plan than
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
what this does this i think buys this
 
01:26:12.070 --> 01:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
time so we don't deal with more closures
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
represent weiler
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
as i recall new hampshire now has more
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
deaths than births so we've seen him
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
obviously from looking at the
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
demographics in the schools we're seeing
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
a much smaller number of and so what
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
percentage would you estimate if it's
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
anything like what we're seeing in the
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
school population it's like five percent
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
every year less
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the births so
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
i think we've been in the upper 11 000
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
total births in the state um i think
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
around 11 7
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
um 11.7 11 700 approximately you know
 
01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
we've been around
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit above 12 000 previously
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
there was i think just an article in the
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
paper today i think front page of the
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
monitor about a concern of a spike in
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh births related to what's
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
people getting back to sort of
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
planning life if you will um
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
but you know up in the north country in
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the medicaid percentages
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
whereas it's just about twenty five
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
percent of the birth statewide are our
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
medicaid it can approach forty percent
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
um and i think even a couple occasions
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of the births depend on
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
medicaid in order to deliver the service
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
and getting paid
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
you know something that is
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
probably less than
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
half of what commercial um
 
01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.990 align:start position:0%
half of what commercial um
uh

01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
insurers are paying in in some cases
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
more than three times less
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
you know i think that those hospitals
 
01:27:40.239 --> 01:27:42.310 align:start position:0%
you know i think that those hospitals
that

01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
are more dependent on medicaid need a
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
little extra help and that's why
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
the bill also has that provision that
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
you asked about representative edwards
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
which is the commissioner to be able to
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
target some of this funding so those
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
that are most vulnerable but would have
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
a base amount so that all
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
all the remaining hospitals are able to
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
continue i think that base amount was 20
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
and because there's a relatively small
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
amount of births
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
rural hospitals is there's enough to to
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
do that plus to to give an extra amount
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
to the to the north country and um also
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
there's the western part of the state
 
01:28:17.679 --> 01:28:18.550 align:start position:0%
there's the western part of the state
too

01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay so just generally my concern any
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
time there's discretion is it be applied
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
transparent and and fair manner but
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
that that's for all of these sorts of
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
things was it your testimony that a
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
normal newborn the medicaid
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate right now is about
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars per delivery yes
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
for normal i don't i don't know how they
 
01:28:40.709 --> 01:28:40.719 align:start position:0%
do it for anywhere near that and then
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
and then so obviously if there's a an
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
icu incident that's got to be more
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
um but uh and so medicaid's probably uh
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
cutting corners there too on uh the nicu
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i think you know we've done a lot
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
recently to
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
buttress mental health including um for
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
involuntary admissions our reimbursement
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
has gone significantly up
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
what i think you know
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
today what we're faced with if we don't
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
do something we're so low that we end up
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
creating something much more expensive
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
for us to deal with down the line here
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
so it's 25 enough
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's enough to buy us some time
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
to because there are some things that i
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
think are going on the state in terms of
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
studies of how maybe delivery models
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
could evolve and
 
01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's our intent to to
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
work with
 
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
the greater community that's delivering
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
babies to look at what the options are
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
because it's not just money it's also
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
workforce and making sure that you know
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's enough workforce and backup
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
available um
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
and so i think we
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
we do need this
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
um preferentially now um to avoid
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
further closure and then
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
to to look on a more comprehensive plan
 
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.790 align:start position:0%
to to look on a more comprehensive plan
um

01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
and i really do think that the north
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
country you know seen some
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
some benefit of
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
the pandemic if you will in terms of
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
increasing the
 
01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.750 align:start position:0%
increasing the
the

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
number of people that are in the
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
community that are of lower ages you
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
know balancing the demographics and i
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
think if you had uh taylor coswell here
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
he would he would support that um
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
strongly um
 
01:30:18.639 --> 01:30:19.669 align:start position:0%
strongly um
but

01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that
 
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
how about midwives do
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
do does midwifery get any
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
increase as a result of this so senate
 
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.950 align:start position:0%
increase as a result of this so senate
bill

01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
408 in terms of birthing centers um
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
provides for now i'm just talking about
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
what's in 430. in 430 no this is just
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
specifically for the institutional um
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
services in the hospital is that an
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
oversight should we add midwifery um
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
um in many instances
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
i think that we probably when we come
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
back we need to look at the professional
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
side of things um the obstetrician and
 
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:03.110 align:start position:0%
side of things um the obstetrician and
the

01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
um the midwifery
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
so this is just the technical side not
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
the professional side
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay in many cases that
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
now providers are part of hospital
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
systems through employment or some other
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
contract i i do think that the whole
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
system of caring for
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
for newborns and
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't i don't mean to cut you
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
off it's just we got a lot of roads
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
still to go uh mr ripple i'm i'm i'm
 
01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:31.830 align:start position:0%
still to go uh mr ripple i'm i'm i'm
reading

01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
reading
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh line 29 about the sum of 2.4 million
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
and similar to the last phrasing this
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
looks like these funds lapse
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes they would
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay so with that i i would just say uh
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
do you have any questions anyone have
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay so uh i'm i'm predisposed to
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
supporting this um is there any
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
discussion around that because i'd like
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
to take a straw vote if uh
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's 2.4
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay so same thing if you're in favor of
 
01:32:11.679 --> 01:32:12.629 align:start position:0%
okay so same thing if you're in favor of
leaving

01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
this section alone in 4 30
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
without modification please raise your
 
01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.790 align:start position:0%
without modification please raise your
hand

01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
okay that looks unanimous
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
so we can skip over this uh then
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:32:28.159 --> 01:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
um

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
now or do you think you're ready for six
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay so we're gonna go
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
back in time
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
to page three
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
so if i understand this
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
section correctly
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's essentially eliminating an annual
 
01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.550 align:start position:0%
it's essentially eliminating an annual
report

01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
and i had to read kind of deeply to get
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
into this on expanded
 
01:33:01.110 --> 01:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid family planning services
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
which was being provided to the fiscal
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee and i have not been on that
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee very long so i haven't seen it
 
01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:07.750 align:start position:0%
committee very long so i haven't seen it
but

01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
i actually would be interested in seeing
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
such a report on an annual basis so i
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
would suggest deleting this section so
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
that in fact
 
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
we would get an annual report on the
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid family planning
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
services to the fiscal committee so as i
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
understand your point on line 23 where
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
there's a strikethrough of the words and
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
annually thereafter making this you know
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
no longer an annual report
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
you would you would not want those words
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
stricken so that we would maintain this
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
as an annual report
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that's right i believe that's
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
what's necessary to achieve
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
the goal okay so i have a question on
 
01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:45.270 align:start position:0%
the goal okay so i have a question on
the

01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
earlier in line 12
 
01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.590 align:start position:0%
earlier in line 12
2013

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
2013
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
is referenced july 1 2013 i just wanted
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that wasn't a typo was it
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
john williams director of legislative
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
affairs and as you correctly point out
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's an existing law this actually
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
came from legislation from 2013
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
and part of our efforts here to
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
clean up outdated
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements this request was
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
made by director tilly from the division
 
01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:20.709 align:start position:0%
made by director tilly from the division
for

01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
public health we wanted to tread lightly
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
we understood the importance of the
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
remainder but we just wanted to remove
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
the annual reporting requirements since
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
we've been fulfilling that since the
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
2013 data okay mr williams i i
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
i don't i've been around and i've not
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
actually seen this report that i recall
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i'd uh i think as much
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
we fully funded the governor's family
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
planning services
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i suspect we'll continue to do that
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
but it would really be great to actually
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
get reports so i
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
personally in in favor of striking
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
through the strikethrough so that we can
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
keep the annual report
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the representative edwards if i
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
could respond just from a drafting
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
standpoint if that's the goal to keep
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
existing law then you'd be much better
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
off directing mr ripple to just removing
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
the section from the bill
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
because this represents existing law
 
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
all right so so i
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
so on the issue of deleting the annual
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement does
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
anyone on the committee
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
seem to want to get rid of the annual
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement or would you like
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
what we're doing to deliver family
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
services planning services i would like
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
to see it come to some agency or some
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee because i've never seen it
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
normally these reports come to fiscal
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
i've never seen one
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
and and i've been on hhs oversight so i
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it there either but um so
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
so let's uh let's do a straw poll
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
because i'm not i'm not getting this
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
complete sense but
 
01:35:58.880 --> 01:35:59.590 align:start position:0%
complete sense but
i

01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
would like to maintain the requirement
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
to keep an annual report and it sounds
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
like the smartest way to do that is just
 
01:36:09.990 --> 01:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
delete this section because the really
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
the only thing it does is delete the
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
three words in annually thereafter
 
01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:15.910 align:start position:0%
three words in annually thereafter
so

01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
do you guys want to talk about it
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
amongst yourself first or do you want to
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
just go for a straw vote
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
okay so um again we're gonna do two
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
votes uh first one will be
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
are you in favor of deleting lines 11
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
through 24 with the if i'm sorry 11 line
 
01:36:37.119 --> 01:36:38.310 align:start position:0%
through 24 with the if i'm sorry 11 line
11

01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
11
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
oh you're right it starts in line nine
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
nine through 24. so i i'm proposing that
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
we delete that so that we maintain the
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
annual requirement or if you are in
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
favor of deleting that section so that
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
the report remains annual you'll raise
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
i see everyone
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
okay so that's unanimous so mr ripple
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
can you make that happen yes
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:37:11.119 --> 01:37:12.709 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
so

01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
so i think we've talked about the four
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
sections of concern in 430 um
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
and so if that is the case and i'll let
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
you confirm it but what what i would
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
like to do though is because this is
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
just so thick there's so many issues
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
here uh is give everyone an opportunity
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
to come back
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and and we could we can still
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
pick out a section if you got an issue
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
with it so uh consider this an
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
um with that uh
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
i think i'm ready to close 4 30.
 
01:37:49.199 --> 01:37:50.070 align:start position:0%
i think i'm ready to close 4 30.
um

01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
mr ripple what do you think we've done
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
on 4 30
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
so i have two amendments so far one is
 
01:37:59.590 --> 01:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
you would accept amendment 1743 h
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
however you would remove the non-lapsing
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
sentence to make it lapsing instead and
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
thank you that's the way i understood it
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
this is relative to the childhood
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
adverse experiences treatment and
 
01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
adverse experiences treatment and
prevention

01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative walls has caught my eye
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
because this is another pilot program
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
kind of deal and i my working assumption
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
until i hear otherwise is
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
pilot projects need a lot of planning
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
for them to be effective and i'd like to
 
01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
hear about the planning senator whitley
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
welcome back what do you want to tell us
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i appreciate the
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh talk about this bill
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i admittedly this is a bit of a dense
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
bill there are a number of
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
programs and sort of clarifications in
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
here but the overall
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill is to fill in a gap
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
in our existing children's system of
 
01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
care so this legislature has done a
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
whole lot of work building the
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
children's system of care for children
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
with mental health
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh and um and also trauma and so
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
but there is a big there is a big gap in
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
services for young children
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
zero to five and so this bill looks at
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
the prevention side of the program
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we get families and children
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
when they are already in crisis when
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
they are in emergency rooms when they
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
are in out of state facilities and i am
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
often asked well how do we get these
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
families before
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
they get to crisis when they are the
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
most expensive and this is the way that
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
we do it we focus on the prevention side
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
so this is a really missing piece
 
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
of that puzzle
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
and it also recognizes that the impact
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
of trauma on young children is very
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
significant children are of course very
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to the impacts of trauma both
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
in how vulnerable they are just as young
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
children but also how it impacts their
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
brain but
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
the good news on that is that their
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
brains are very plastic
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
they are able to there's interventions
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
that we can do to mitigate the impacts
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
of trauma so that's what this bill
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
attempts to do so i'm happy to go
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
through the various parts um and answer
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
so first i just want to ask you a couple
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
simple questions sure okay
 
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:34.149 align:start position:0%
simple questions sure okay
um

01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
so the the cornerstone of a zero to five
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
age group
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with prevention
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
the target population for education is
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
really are really the parents right so
 
01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
so we're this program
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
at its core is intended to
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
educate parents to not abuse their
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
children in some way
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
and to avoid the the aces
 
01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:01.270 align:start position:0%
and to avoid the the aces
uh

01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
happening in the first place yes sir so
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
i you are absolutely correct that we
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
need to make sure we're to support young
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
children we need to support and educate
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
families i think to get exactly to what
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about if you look at
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
section 9
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
is the arpa appropriation for family
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
resources centers we already have a
 
01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:22.790 align:start position:0%
resources centers we already have a
robust

01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
robust
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
regional structure of family resource
 
01:41:25.199 --> 01:41:26.470 align:start position:0%
regional structure of family resource
centers

01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
centers
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
they have received federal money in the
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
past that we need to leverage
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
um but we need those resource centers to
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
have what they need to support families
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
to prevent child abuse and neglect it's
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
called primary prevention
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
so so you have a lot of interesting
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
people in the senate so you've probably
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
heard somebody
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
raise the issue
 
01:41:49.199 --> 01:41:50.390 align:start position:0%
raise the issue
of

01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
is it appropriate for the government to
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
be intervening with parents
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
to parent them on how to parent is that
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
is that an appropriate role of
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
government have you heard that general
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
question and how would you answer it we
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
actually didn't get that question in the
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
senate i mean i think here all all these
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
are voluntary we're not forcing parents
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
to get interventions these are just you
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
know interventions that are available
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
should families need the support so
 
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
there's nothing mandatory about this i
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
think that's not that's not something i
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
believe the senate would support at this
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
point but these are the supports that
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
should be available and the treatment
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
that should be available if a family and
 
01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
what what is your reasoning or how would
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
you argue
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
on why this shouldn't just be
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
incorporated in the next budget
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh well because children are in crisis
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
right now we have children that are you
 
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
know the the
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic has exacerbated a lot of things
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
including the children's mental health
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
crisis we have children in crisis right
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
now we can't wait any longer and we do
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
know i mean
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
this is one of the most horrific things
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
that i have heard recently during the
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic we have seen an increase in
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
child sex abuse for this age group so
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
this is a crisis that we can't really i
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
know it's horrific we can't really hold
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
off on
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
um the other piece to is it is it mr
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
chair is that we have the dollars
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
available right now through arpa dollars
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
those are discretionary dollars so there
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
are no
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds there are no excuse me
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
state funds appropriated so i'm sorry if
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
you look at the fiscal note it is
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
incorrect at this point there are four
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
appropriations listed
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note but on the senate
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
floor we took out two of those so the
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
only remaining appropriations are number
 
01:43:40.639 --> 01:43:41.430 align:start position:0%
only remaining appropriations are number
two

01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
seven hundred thousand and number four
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
one hundred uh one million so the other
 
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
two appropriations are gone and uh and
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
the remaining appropriations are
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
strictly arpa dollars so so mr ripple
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
are you aware of a update to the fiscal
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
note in works
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh we have i haven't yet updated that
 
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
one but
 
01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
i can take a look and see if i can
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
provide an update for tomorrow
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
you agree with senator whitley's
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
observation though i do yes
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
all right so i i'm going to come to
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative erf in just a second i
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
got one more question for you
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh you just mentioned something heinous
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
that zero to five sexual abuse
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
and and we're talking about a voluntary
 
01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:25.350 align:start position:0%
and and we're talking about a voluntary
program

01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm just curious if we think that
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
the depravity of a of a perpetrator in
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
this situation is just beyond
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
anything we can do on a voluntary basis
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
i mean i i i understand for everything
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
else for this is maybe a good program
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
but i just i i don't know if we're
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
setting as an objective to
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
or how we would even go about
 
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
remediate such a horrible problem yeah
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know i yes so in in new hampshire
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
you may know that we have both a
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
voluntary and if there's a finding of
 
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect then that's a whole
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
different track for parents and you know
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
the director of dcyf can speak to that
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
so we have that when there's a finding
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
there that will be some sort of
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory things involved and then we
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
have a voluntary system
 
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the impacts of child sex
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
abuse so part of this um
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
the the one of the remaining
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
appropriations is to expand the
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
workforce for child parent psychotherapy
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
that's an intervention for young
 
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
children to mitigate the impacts of
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
horrific trauma that we were just
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
talking about so i think it is
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know imperative that these children
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
that have been impacted by this horrific
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
trauma get the treatment that they need
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
to grow up into healthy adults so this
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
it just seems that the treatment plan
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
would be to arrest in prison imprison
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator but um but anyway
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
anyways i don't want to get into all
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
that i do want to give representative
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
erf an opportunity to ask this question
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
so just one question
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
given these are all arpa funds couldn't
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
this just come through fiscal
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
there uh thank you for the question
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
there are some portions that did go
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
through fiscal for example there's a
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
pilot program in here that the
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
department has been working on um and
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
the authority is in in this language and
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
they did go through fiscal but these are
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
the remaining portions that have not
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
gone through fiscal and there isn't
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
really a plan to do so i i don't want to
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
again for the record rebecca ross
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
director of the bureau for children's
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
behavioral health that's correct we did
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal item that was approved in
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
november of last year for 1.6 million
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
for the zero to five population these
 
01:46:46.229 --> 01:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
are additional programs that were not
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
included in that it would codify
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
some portions of this permanently as
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
part of the system of care
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason he didn't go
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
through physical because you're there's
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
policy stuff in here that would become
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
part of the system of care correct
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
so these funds
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
these are arpa funds so
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
is there a user to lose it aspect of
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh that is a good question i
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
so the dollars that we're talking about
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
here are not um sort of designated arpa
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
dollars they're arpa discretionary
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
dollars and maybe mr ripple can answer
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
that question i don't know when our
 
01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
official requirement to spend is
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
i actually don't know that one off the
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
top of my head i'd have to check on it
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
all right so it's really just a
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
cautionary note to the department to
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that they get the program
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
the funds obligated before they run out
 
01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:57.350 align:start position:0%
the funds obligated before they run out
but

01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
um okay so
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
i is are there any other questions i i
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
think um
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm generally uh predisposed to this
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
unless somebody tells me i'm not but i
 
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
think i am
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh is is
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
i'm ready for a strava are you all ready
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
for a strava okay so
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor of
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
of otp on sb 444 you'll raise your hand
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything anybody in
 
01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.830 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything anybody in
opposition

01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%

okay so that brings us down to the final
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
two but these final two are rather
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
significant so
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
i i would like to uh put us into recess
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
for about five ten minutes so that
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
everyone can stretch their legs and and
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
and kind of
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
re-ready themselves to to go through
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
this so
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh i have uh
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
the time now 2 50.
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
um let's let's get started no later than
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you might want to know that
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
the official mr ripple just sent us
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
information on 416. i just saw it in my
 
01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:40.070 align:start position:0%
information on 416. i just saw it in my
email

01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:40.080 --> 01:56:14.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.599 --> 01:57:09.109 align:start position:0%
 
458.

01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
so mr ripple you you do not have an
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
amendment for 458 right so we're just
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
going to use my discussion draft okay
 
01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
which i do not i did not print out
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
so so i have three o'clock
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
is everyone ready to get started i i
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
probably ought to wait for mr ripple
 
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
he's probably secretly the most
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
so i i've given you a discussion draft
 
02:00:39.679 --> 02:00:40.709 align:start position:0%
so i i've given you a discussion draft
on

02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:00:40.719 --> 02:00:42.550 align:start position:0%
on
458

02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
458
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
by that i mean i went through there and
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
i i made some markups to stimulate some
 
02:00:48.239 --> 02:00:56.390 align:start position:0%
i i made some markups to stimulate some
conversation

02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:56.400 --> 02:01:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:01:19.510 --> 02:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
so mr ribson i i i'm
 
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'm i'd like you to sit at the
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
table so if we have questions that come
 
02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:28.790 align:start position:0%
table so if we have questions that come
up

02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
but uh because the committee
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
talked about 458 last friday
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
and and we have this discussion draft to
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
walk through
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh i i think i think the role i'd like
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
you to be prepared to play is to follow
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
along with us and and then if we have an
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
issue that we want to take a side track
 
02:01:51.750 --> 02:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
on have you get engaged
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
do you but i want to respect do you want
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
any preparatory remarks before we we
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
start driving through this
 
02:02:02.229 --> 02:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
for the committee i want to end by five
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
why do i want to end by five because
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
janet clayman
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
needs to leave and so we'd like to get
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
all our paperwork into janet so
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
so uh 458 an act relative to the
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
use services center and operation of a
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
topic that we come through if we just go
 
02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:29.589 align:start position:0%
topic that we come through if we just go
chronologically

02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
chronologically
 
02:02:29.599 --> 02:02:30.830 align:start position:0%
chronologically
is

02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
i took
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
and had begun to amend the sen the
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
version passed by the senate
 
02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
i skipped over
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
and this is a little bit rude probably i
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
skipped over
 
02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:52.870 align:start position:0%
skipped over
the

02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
version that got passed
 
02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
out of the policy committee
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
and out and out of the house
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
why did i do that i did that because
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
i had
 
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
a sidebar
 
02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:08.310 align:start position:0%
a sidebar
with

02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
who said
 
02:03:13.750 --> 02:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
to me that
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
he really liked the senate version
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that he could see himself signing
 
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
the senate version
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
so so i
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
have tacked towards the senate version
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
and then identified some things where i
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
know we're at odds
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
that we'll be at odds with the policy
 
02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:34.709 align:start position:0%
that we'll be at odds with the policy
committee

02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
how bad is that well i don't know if you
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
listened to the um
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
the executive session on 458
 
02:03:44.239 --> 02:03:45.030 align:start position:0%
the executive session on 458
in

02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:03:48.229 --> 02:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
children and family law
 
02:03:48.239 --> 02:03:49.109 align:start position:0%
children and family law
but

02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the committee
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
basically said
 
02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:55.750 align:start position:0%
basically said
that

02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
i don't want to mischaracterize it so i
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
won't i
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
so this is not meant to be anything like
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
a quote but my interpretation of what
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
she said was we're going to do things
 
02:04:10.229 --> 02:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
like reduce the capacity down to six and
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
then if finance thinks differently they
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
can negotiate it up
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
um and so i
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
also heard from
 
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
you were there
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
is is that a fair summary i don't i
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
it is okay
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
then the other big thing
 
02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
the house did
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
was they inserted a lot of language from
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
hb 254
 
02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
254 passed the house went over to the
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
senate the senate
 
02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
as i understand
 
02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:48.390 align:start position:0%
as i understand
has

02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
gotten themselves in a position to
 
02:04:50.719 --> 02:04:52.310 align:start position:0%
gotten themselves in a position to
adopt

02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
or to pass sb 254
 
02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:56.629 align:start position:0%
or to pass sb 254
with

02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
what has been characterized as
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
some minor amendments
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh and those minor amendments
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh if nothing else addressed concerns
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
that were expressed
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
that if there was no consequence for
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
property crime
 
02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:12.870 align:start position:0%
property crime
possible

02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
that we would be invent inviting
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
property crime such as the smash and
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
grab types of things that we're seeing
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
i i i don't think there's any intent to
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
start taking kids
 
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
who have
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
participated in property crimes and
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly put them in the sununu
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
center now this is just a fallback i
 
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.030 align:start position:0%
center now this is just a fallback i
think

02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
and our judges if we look at the data
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
our judges have done a pretty good job
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
along with the legislature of reducing
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
the census over the last few years
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
um from 2019 to 2020
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
there's been an obvious trend down
 
02:05:52.390 --> 02:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
to where
 
02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of 11's and
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
10's towards the right side so that's a
 
02:06:00.069 --> 02:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
daily census
 
02:06:00.079 --> 02:06:01.589 align:start position:0%
daily census
so

02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a background that's me
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
trying to tee this up
 
02:06:07.119 --> 02:06:07.990 align:start position:0%
trying to tee this up
um

02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:08.790 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
the first issue that gets addressed
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
is the is the bed capacity
 
02:06:14.639 --> 02:06:15.510 align:start position:0%
is the is the bed capacity
um

02:06:15.510 --> 02:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:18.709 align:start position:0%
the uh
the

02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:21.510 --> 02:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee on children and family law
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to go to six instead of the 18
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
that was in hb2
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
it did not appear from watching the
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
executive session on the bill that there
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
was any data behind it it seemed as
 
02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:36.709 align:start position:0%
was any data behind it it seemed as
though

02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
though
 
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
it was a a hope and a prayer kind of
 
02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:40.709 align:start position:0%
it was a a hope and a prayer kind of
number

02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative walner you and i had a
 
02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
chance to talk briefly this weekend and
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
and you i think you have something you
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
may want to say on whether
 
02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
6 12 18 or some other number is
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
well i do think that you know we've
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot in the last
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
several years to
 
02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
reduce the uh
 
02:07:03.679 --> 02:07:04.629 align:start position:0%
reduce the uh
the

02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
number of children that are housed at um
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
the sununu center and i think there's
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
still a few things that we can do to
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
continue reducing it
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
i do think it's interesting that
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
what we were handed out
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
to right just now
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
looks different than what i got in my
 
02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:24.229 align:start position:0%
looks different than what i got in my
email

02:07:24.229 --> 02:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
email
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
i got something where it was divided by
 
02:07:31.599 --> 02:07:32.950 align:start position:0%
i got something where it was divided by
detained

02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
detained
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
and committed and so when i look at
 
02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
those numbers i think this is something
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
where it's all been lumped together so
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
it makes the numbers somewhat larger
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
also i do
 
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
pay attention to the dashboard
 
02:07:51.910 --> 02:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
that we get monthly
 
02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:53.109 align:start position:0%
that we get monthly
and

02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
i need to go find my february day or my
 
02:07:57.750 --> 02:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
march dashboard but
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
i thought in the month of february the
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
dashboard actually said we were at eight
 
02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:03.750 align:start position:0%
dashboard actually said we were at eight
children

02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:04.709 align:start position:0%
children
so

02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
i i just wonder what the discrepancies
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
are with this this piece that we just
 
02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:09.750 align:start position:0%
are with this this piece that we just
got

02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
and what we received in our email
 
02:08:14.550 --> 02:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
so what you receive your email is a
 
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
excel file that has three tabs on it
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
the first tab is the daily count of
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
every single day from january 1 2019
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
through today and it's a list that has
 
02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
male female detained committed
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
the second tab is this chart which is
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
just a
 
02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
chart format of the average daily census
 
02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
of each of those months so if you took
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
all of those days and averaged them out
 
02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
this chart shows that the third tab on
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
that excel spreadsheet has the same data
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
but just listed in a spreadsheet form
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
rather than in a chart
 
02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure i'm to answer your
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
second question
 
02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's i'm certain that there were not
 
02:08:49.589 --> 02:08:49.599 align:start position:0%
only eight youth at syse in february so
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what that is i'll have to
 
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
look again and see i just i mean it
 
02:08:56.390 --> 02:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
could just have been a typo so who knows
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
can i have another yes
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:08:59.679 --> 02:09:02.790 align:start position:0%
go ahead
so

02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
i guess for this
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
for our deliberations here today i would
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
like to and i guess everybody must have
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
gotten in their email
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
charts that were separated
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
i guess what i would
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
like to take a look at are the number of
 
02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:23.109 align:start position:0%
like to take a look at are the number of
committed

02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
committed
 
02:09:23.119 --> 02:09:24.229 align:start position:0%
committed
children

02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to committed and detained
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
inflates the number
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
can can i turn that into a specific
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
question uh so for example
 
02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:39.750 align:start position:0%
question uh so for example
on

02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh december 1st of 2020
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
it shows a total daily population of 10.
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
can you tell us what the committed
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
versus detained were
 
02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
so again the spreadsheet that i sent out
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
had one page with every single day so
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
december 1st 2020 there were let me just
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
so so i think you're just going to have
 
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
to eyeball it and give us a number first
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
2020 there were four detained females
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
zero detained males so total of four
 
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
detained on december 1st 2020
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
let's see i'm trying to make sure i have
 
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
this lined up right on the printout
 
02:10:28.079 --> 02:10:30.870 align:start position:0%
this lined up right on the printout
sorry

02:10:30.870 --> 02:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
we're asking you to compare apples and
 
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
oranges though because you have daily
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
information and we have an average of a
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
month yeah and you have you have the
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
daily too it was in the spreadsheet that
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
i sent you i said i sent both the daily
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i had that wrong december 2020
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
total detained
 
02:10:54.550 --> 02:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
was four there were zero female detained
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
four male detained total committed was
 
02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:58.629 align:start position:0%
four male detained total committed was
five

02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
there was one female committed and four
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
male committed on that date
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
total commitment was
 
02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
on that date total committed five on
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
december one twenty
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
on that date on that one date right so
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
it varies so um
 
02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
 
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
no i just wanted to
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
point out that there are
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
two categories and i believe this chart
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
sort of lumps everyone together
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
and i think we need to look at
 
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
so let me ask you a question about that
 
02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
is it your thought
 
02:11:36.079 --> 02:11:37.510 align:start position:0%
is it your thought
that

02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
we could reduce the population at sununu
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
more by simply having a different place
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
i think that would be that would be a
 
02:11:51.520 --> 02:11:52.629 align:start position:0%
i think that would be that would be a
possibility

02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
02:11:55.109 --> 02:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
by using uh providers that we're already
 
02:11:55.119 --> 02:11:57.750 align:start position:0%
by using uh providers that we're already
using

02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.760 --> 02:11:58.629 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
so the way that syc currently operates
 
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
and the way that we anticipate a future
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
state operating is we no longer
 
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
programmatically distinguish between
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
detained and committed kids because the
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
numbers have gotten so small once upon a
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
time there was a detained unit separate
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
from the rest of the committed facility
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
as the numbers got so small it became
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
silly because sometimes you'd have one
 
02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599 align:start position:0%
kid in a detained unit and you'd have
 
02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
you know so we got to the point where we
 
02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:21.119 align:start position:0%
started mixing kids
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
by gender and by programmatic need
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
rather than by detention or commitment
 
02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:26.470 align:start position:0%
rather than by detention or commitment
status

02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
status
 
02:12:28.069 --> 02:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
just made much more sense operationally
 
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
because you condense the kids
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
in a way that you could you know have
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
sensible or at least something
 
02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
approaching sensible staffing
 
02:12:35.679 --> 02:12:36.709 align:start position:0%
approaching sensible staffing
the

02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:38.310 --> 02:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
moving detained kids out i think could
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
be challenging you still need a fully
 
02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:44.790 align:start position:0%
be challenging you still need a fully
secured

02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
secured
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
facility for detained kids a lot of
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
times the detained kids are actually
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
even more unstable and difficult to work
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
with than the committed kids although it
 
02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
varies because we have kids that come in
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
with all types of needs and offenses
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
so you could do that but i i don't know
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
that while it might reduce the size of
 
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
that facility you would then need a
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
separate facility that you were paying
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
somebody else to run or that the state
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
so the approach
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
and there's no legislation now telling
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
you to segregate detain from committed
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
and therefore at this point if we're
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
using existing legislation it is an
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
aggregate number right
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
so um so the first thing i did was
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
where in the senate bill it said 18 beds
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
i added
 
02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
that the facility is at least 14 beds
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
but no more than 18.
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
i direct that the commissioner dhhs
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
shall conduct a data analysis to
 
02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
determine the bed capacity to be used
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
for future architectural designs using
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
pan's past census trends and expected
 
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
census impacts of current legislation
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
and to do that no later than july 31 of
 
02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
this year
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
the department will prioritize locating
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
the well we'll stop there because this
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
is that's really the point of that
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
is to say
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
rather than make this a legislative
 
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
effort to just
 
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
grab a number i i would hope that we
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
would agree that data analysis is the
 
02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to set the capacity
 
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
and and that
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
we we can trust and defer to the
 
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner the process of doing a data
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
analysis to pick the number
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
we up we i think we're kind of around
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
the same ballpark 18 was in hp2
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
maybe this data suggests it doesn't need
 
02:14:39.910 --> 02:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
to be as much as 18 except for the fact
 
02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:40.870 align:start position:0%
to be as much as 18 except for the fact
that

02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
you never know when you're going to get
 
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
a weird surge you're never going to know
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
when you're going to need to have a
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
unique division of male female
 
02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:52.310 align:start position:0%
unique division of male female
and

02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
separations due to things like gang
 
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
status and the like so so some surge
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
capacity does seem to make sense above
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
just a hard number
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
um delegating
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
to the professionals
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
the actual
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
size between that range
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
do you guys want to talk about that
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
what do you think representative long
 
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.229 --> 02:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
senate bill 254
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
now we know there's a couple of areas
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
that are problematic
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
would that
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
would some of that language decrease
 
02:15:36.719 --> 02:15:38.950 align:start position:0%
would some of that language decrease
detained

02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
detained
 
02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:39.750 align:start position:0%
detained
i'm

02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
i am not comfortable predicting that
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
that's going to necessarily decrease the
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
census and for the reasons i spoke about
 
02:15:47.189 --> 02:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
last time because what
 
02:15:47.199 --> 02:15:47.830 align:start position:0%
last time because what
the

02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
the original original version of 254
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
prior to the one that passed the house
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
retains something that was that's in
 
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
current law which is three lesser crimes
 
02:15:57.669 --> 02:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
could still have a child go to syc and
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's actually the way that most kids
 
02:16:01.109 --> 02:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
who go to sysc end up there after
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
multiple charges not after a first
 
02:16:07.189 --> 02:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
offense the way that 254 changed that in
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
one of the amendments in the current
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
version that's over in the senate was it
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated that kind of pathway but
 
02:16:14.550 --> 02:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
added in a new pathway based on
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
community safety and community risk
 
02:16:18.149 --> 02:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
which is a policy i don't necessarily
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
think is a bad
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
shift but i am not i'm not able to
 
02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
predict that that's going to result in
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
less kids in the facility
 
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
and i think you know it's it's risky to
 
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
assume that that's going to result in
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
less kids in the facility i just i don't
 
02:16:34.709 --> 02:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
know that it will and i'd be it could
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
result in more kids i mean i just don't
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know how that's going to play
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
out compared to the current the current
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
pathway that's fair thank you
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
we're representing wyler
 
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair but detained
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
so the ones that are not detained can we
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
no there's not there's not bail um in
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
the juvenile system when kids are
 
02:17:01.519 --> 02:17:02.469 align:start position:0%
the juvenile system when kids are
detained

02:17:02.469 --> 02:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
detained
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
typically they go in for it could even
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
be a couple days while things are sorted
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
out there could be weeks while things
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
are sorted out or if there's
 
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
complexities they could be in detained
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
status for
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
i've seen kids in ordinary detained
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
status for three or four months while
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for certification
 
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
processes and things like that and even
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
longer and when kids go in as adults we
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
categorize them as detained so when kids
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
go in because they've been charged and
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
and found guilty of an adult level
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
offense and they remain with us until
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
they turn 18 in that instance those all
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
fall into the detained category the
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
commitment category is following
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
adjudication when a determination is
 
02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
made that
 
02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
the youth committed whatever offense and
 
02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
the way that law currently works most
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
offenses result in what is a three-month
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
time in a commitment status followed by
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
a parole hearing
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
at which point most of the young people
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
do get out after three months committed
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
status and then we'll move on to whether
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
it's back home or residential program or
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
some other option and then some of the
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
more serious offenses could be a six
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
month prior to parole
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
yeah because the lawyers are defending
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
and delaying and all that sort of thing
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
but so this is unusual to have these few
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
and detained i guess
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
yeah you know what's really interesting
 
02:18:10.639 --> 02:18:11.669 align:start position:0%
yeah you know what's really interesting
is

02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know that and if you look at that
 
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
day by day data and really did analysis
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
you would see there was a period where
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
we had more detained kids than committed
 
02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:19.110 align:start position:0%
we had more detained kids than committed
kids

02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
kids
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
but now we've seen that kind of flip
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
back again not by a lot a couple more
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
committed a couple more to team but it's
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
no you know if you look at the
 
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
historical data going back 20 years
 
02:18:28.589 --> 02:18:28.599 align:start position:0%
you're seeing
 
02:18:31.429 --> 02:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
120 committed kids and 20 detained kids
 
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
and now we're seeing about
 
02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:34.150 align:start position:0%
and now we're seeing about
ballpark

02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
ballpark
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
six and six five and five
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
unpredictable so so i would imagine that
 
02:18:39.359 --> 02:18:40.469 align:start position:0%
unpredictable so so i would imagine that
financial

02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
financial
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
disclosure that you hear sometimes about
 
02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
past performances not indicative of the
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
future performance that that applies
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
here too right i mean we can do a great
 
02:18:52.309 --> 02:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
data analysis but it's sort of difficult
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
to foresee
 
02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
how well that trend will hold up in the
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
long term and we're building a facility
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
for what 20 30 years at least
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
i'd imagine so okay
 
02:19:03.599 --> 02:19:04.629 align:start position:0%
i'd imagine so okay
so

02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:04.639 --> 02:19:06.950 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
so i i don't want to call anyone out by
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
name but i've heard
 
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
a member of this committee say that the
 
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
the bad count should be
 
02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:17.429 align:start position:0%
the bad count should be
six

02:19:17.429 --> 02:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
six
 
02:19:19.349 --> 02:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
does anyone want to talk about the
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
number six
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
if if mine's if mine's the name you want
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
to call i'll feel free i'm glad to speak
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
to it i've told you i don't support your
 
02:19:26.319 --> 02:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
to it i've told you i don't support your
amendment

02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's fine i have time to find another
 
02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:34.610 align:start position:0%
vice chair
 
02:19:34.610 --> 02:19:35.830 align:start position:0%
vice chair
[Music]

02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
could i ask uh rep
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative um mr ripson another
 
02:19:42.719 --> 02:19:43.750 align:start position:0%
representative um mr ripson another
question

02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:44.790 align:start position:0%
question
so

02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
could you
 
02:19:48.950 --> 02:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
tell me how many
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
group home beds you are contracted for
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh rebecca ross can probably give the
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
exact number but it's
 
02:20:00.389 --> 02:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
probably 400 or so around the state
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
you have any idea how many children are
 
02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
in those beds
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
i think point-in-time data is probably
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 300 and change right
 
02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:09.270 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 300 and change right
now

02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:15.429 --> 02:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
maybe within the last
 
02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
year and a half or so we went to
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
governor council with contracts
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
and that we've changed our way of paying
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
we don't pay any longer
 
02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
per day we now pay by contract
 
02:20:31.590 --> 02:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
so you're contracting for a certain
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
number of beds at a facility is that
 
02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
right not not quite so we did shift to a
 
02:20:38.550 --> 02:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
contracted model for the first time
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
about a little over a year ago or in
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
some instances a little less than a year
 
02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
ago those contracts were finalized the
 
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
reasoning for that was
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
prior to that all these providers were
 
02:20:48.230 --> 02:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
basically operating on they had to meet
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
minimum basic medicaid rule standards
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
and that was kind of the extent of how
 
02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
we were able to
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
to derive what it was we wanted from
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
these providers and we we wanted a lot
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
more than what we were getting so we we
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
created different levels of care with
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
different intensities
 
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
different requirements such as becoming
 
02:21:04.150 --> 02:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
accredited programs utilizing models
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
such as
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
six core strategies to reduce restraint
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
and seclusion etc and we entered into a
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
contract with the providers for that
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
purpose put it out for a public bid
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
everything else the contracts still do
 
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
set a daily rate however so they still
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
do get paid on a daily rate basis for
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
the kids that they're serving
 
02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
but the rates through those contracts
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
were enhanced to actually match what we
 
02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
were asking them to do as opposed to the
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
historical model which people had their
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
rates set once and then they were stuck
 
02:21:29.840 --> 02:21:31.030 align:start position:0%
rates set once and then they were stuck
stagnant

02:21:31.030 --> 02:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
stagnant
 
02:21:34.389 --> 02:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
for in some instances 12 13 years
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah okay just one more question okay um
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
so we
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
have the capacity of 400 beds
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
we're probably around 300
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
at any one time
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
yeah there's probably about that many
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
under contract with about 300 or so that
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
are currently filled i would be careful
 
02:21:54.389 --> 02:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
to say capacity because one of the
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
challenges we've been seeing
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
really since the start of covid but for
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
different reasons is providers not being
 
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
able to actually have the amount of
 
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
available beds that they are required to
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
enter their contracts initially because
 
02:22:07.110 --> 02:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
of separation rules they had under covid
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
currently has much more to do with
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
workforce capacity and not feeling they
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
can safely operate to the full capacity
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
of their contract
 
02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
of their contract
so

02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
we could say i mean i'm sure that of
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
those hundred beds that
 
02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:23.030 align:start position:0%
those hundred beds that
aren't

02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
that are not filled at any one time it
 
02:22:27.190 --> 02:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
might be hard to fill all of the i mean
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
it might be hard to get the um group
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
homes to be able to take all
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
all of those because
 
02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:34.950 align:start position:0%
all of those because
of

02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
staffing and a number of different
 
02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:37.429 align:start position:0%
staffing and a number of different
things

02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
but there is some capacity in group
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
homes at this point i assume
 
02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
i think there's wait lists at most of
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
them but yes on paper there's capacity
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
whether there's you know actual
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
availability today to take a child i
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
think the big distinguishing point that
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
i would make though is that
 
02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:55.110 align:start position:0%
i would make though is that
um

02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
right we don't maintain discretion over
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
whether a child is detained and
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
committed that's that's a court's
 
02:23:00.710 --> 02:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether a child is
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
detained or committed or put into
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
residential care what we do have the
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
authority to do and which we do
 
02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:05.910 align:start position:0%
authority to do and which we do
regularly

02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
02:23:07.990 --> 02:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
is if a child comes to us committed we
 
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
do have the authority to
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
administratively administratively
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
release a child to a residential program
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
if we think the residential program is
 
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
better suited we do that pretty
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
regularly um
 
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
so we often do see kids move from these
 
02:23:24.230 --> 02:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
facilities from from sysc onto
 
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
residential programs
 
02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
but in the first instance we're not the
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
deciding body of courts the deciding
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
body as to where that child is going to
 
02:23:32.950 --> 02:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
go um
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll leave it at that okay thank
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
you so so these census numbers in other
 
02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
words uh reflect those that you you kept
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
and do not include those that you moved
 
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
into an alternative group home
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
correct yeah there's no
 
02:23:51.270 --> 02:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
these are the numbers of the kids are
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
actually in the building excluding the
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
kids under the vermont contract they're
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
not included in these numbers thank you
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
so so this is really to the committee
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of a two-part question
 
02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
are you are you comfortable delegating
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner the authority to do
 
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
the quantitative or the data analysis to
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
establish a bed capacity
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
and if you are
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable with this range of
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
selecting between 14 and 18. would you
 
02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:19.830 align:start position:0%
selecting between 14 and 18. would you
prefer

02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
12 to 20 which i you know i i picked 18
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
of 14 to 18 based on
 
02:24:29.349 --> 02:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
sitting in my comfy chair typing
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm open to
 
02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
i'm listening to the
 
02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
director and i think he's got you know
 
02:24:46.630 --> 02:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
the numbers in his head every day
 
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
more than any of the rest of us could
 
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
come up with and i think from his
 
02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:51.270 align:start position:0%
come up with and i think from his
testimony

02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:57.670 --> 02:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
so part a of that is you're you're
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable delegating to the commission
 
02:25:00.790 --> 02:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
or the authority to pick the final
 
02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:01.750 align:start position:0%
or the authority to pick the final
number

02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
i am
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
do you uh part b do you do you you think
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
the 14 to 18 range gives the
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner enough
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility or would you
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
prefer a different set of numbers
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful it could go less than 14 but
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
if it goes higher what are we going to
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
do and you know i
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'd also like us to look at the option
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
of using more of the private
 
02:25:28.230 --> 02:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh group homes and and
 
02:25:30.630 --> 02:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
having some of them maybe come up to a
 
02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:32.309 align:start position:0%
having some of them maybe come up to a
uh

02:25:32.309 --> 02:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
i guess it's stage four level of uh
 
02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:37.590 align:start position:0%
i guess it's stage four level of uh
security

02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:38.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
so mr ripple at this point um what i
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
would what i would do before this became
 
02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh and there's so much more to it than
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
this but just the beginning
 
02:25:52.469 --> 02:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
is to change the 14 to 12.
 
02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:56.389 align:start position:0%
okay okay
um

02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not hearing anyone say no to
 
02:26:04.830 --> 02:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
i you know certainly respect
 
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh mr ripson's
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
information but i think really it's it's
 
02:26:14.309 --> 02:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature right now that's making
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
the decision
 
02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
what what number would you select
 
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
i would select six
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative long you have an informal
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
voting going on over there
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
what do you think about delegation of
 
02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and what the number
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
should be yeah i mean i did support the
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
six in the policy committee
 
02:26:41.270 --> 02:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
um i
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
it may be a dream
 
02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:44.469 align:start position:0%
it may be a dream
uh

02:26:44.469 --> 02:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
i mean the more i listen to mr ripson
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
the more i see that
 
02:26:52.389 --> 02:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
my six may not be the correct number
 
02:26:54.070 --> 02:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:55.670 align:start position:0%
um but
i

02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
i just want to be assured that we're
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
doing everything that we can
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
to be sure that if there's a program
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
in a community or
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
a service somewhere else
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:14.830 --> 02:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
that child gets that service and not be
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
detained since you were in children and
 
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
family law
 
02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:19.910 align:start position:0%
family law
was

02:27:19.910 --> 02:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
the number six derived
 
02:27:25.590 --> 02:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
from a data analysis perspective or
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
was that
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
a number that was perhaps aspirational
 
02:27:32.309 --> 02:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
as opposed to databased
 
02:27:32.319 --> 02:27:33.670 align:start position:0%
as opposed to databased
uh

02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
i mean i could only speak for myself
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
and it was aspirational
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
for me
 
02:27:40.469 --> 02:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative walls yes
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
so this has been worked on multiple
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
terms multiple years and these numbers
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
have been examined there have been
 
02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:02.630 align:start position:0%
have been examined there have been
working

02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
the number of of the appropriate number
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
of beds has been studied with multiple
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups the department a lot of
 
02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
people have looked at this over a long
 
02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
time this is not something that is
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
aspirational this is this is based on
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
data and you know the disability rights
 
02:28:21.910 --> 02:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
center legal
 
02:28:23.349 --> 02:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh services
 
02:28:25.030 --> 02:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know uh who we heard from before
 
02:28:26.710 --> 02:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
michelle ranger and other people have
 
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
been involved in this in setting this up
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
and i feel like we're kind of sitting
 
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
here right now
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
shooting by the seat of our pants really
 
02:28:36.070 --> 02:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
just relying on the testimony of mr
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
ribson when there's been a lot of other
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
information that came in um and it's
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
been a situation where we have seen over
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
and over again kind of
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
there were two things that contributed
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
to the large numbers of kids
 
02:28:50.230 --> 02:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
incarcerated at sununu one was the size
 
02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the facility if you build it they'll
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
come the other one was the can the the
 
02:28:58.389 --> 02:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
laws under which kids could be committed
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
um as we have reduced the crimes for
 
02:29:03.030 --> 02:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
which kids can be committed
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
we've watched those numbers drop
 
02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
i mean there's been a whole complex of
 
02:29:10.230 --> 02:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
things that have been going on
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
really since we raised the age of
 
02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
delinquency in 2014. they have really
 
02:29:15.990 --> 02:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
worked hard now
 
02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
what would that make that about eight
 
02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:18.550 align:start position:0%
what would that make that about eight
years

02:29:18.550 --> 02:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
of working on this and
 
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know there's a reason we're at six
 
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's not just people shooting by the
 
02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
seat of the pants and and i'm concerned
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we've got one witness here we're
 
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
not hearing from all the people that
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
have worked on this year after year
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
after year from all the people that have
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
been on the study committees that have
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
come up with these numbers and studied
 
02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
this and determined this really is a
 
02:29:41.830 --> 02:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
realistic number and we're doing this
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
here on really very limited information
 
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'm staying with six so
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
actually the opposite that all the
 
02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
analysis that we've seen year after year
 
02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
after year from the alvarez and marcel
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
study to what got into hb2
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
in order to give us the flexibility
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
needed the number was 18.
 
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i i i'm
 
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
expressing some interest in entertaining
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
the possibility of a lower number but
 
02:30:13.110 --> 02:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
six is an imaginary as far as i'm
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
concerned that is a total aspirational
 
02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
stab in the dark and i just am
 
02:30:21.510 --> 02:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
embarrassed at the lack of data analysis
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
that would determine the number six we
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
have a public safety responsibility and
 
02:30:29.270 --> 02:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i think if we put six in there that
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
is an abdication of our responsibility
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
and i will not
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
allow six to be the number uh
 
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
if i have anything i can do about it
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
because that's just it's just imaginary
 
02:30:43.990 --> 02:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's fiction
 
02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
so uh it it mr ripson's here to
 
02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:47.910 align:start position:0%
so uh it it mr ripson's here to
represent

02:30:47.910 --> 02:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
all the analysis has been done to date
 
02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh it is so despite my emotional
 
02:30:56.550 --> 02:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
outburst there mr ripson if you had to
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
guess the number right now based on all
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
of your analysis of all this data for
 
02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
over all of these years and we were
 
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
projecting for a facility for the next
 
02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
20 to 30 years
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
what what number would you sick select
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
the number that we the number that we
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
continue to support is 18. that's not
 
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
based on the idea that we expect there
 
02:31:18.389 --> 02:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
to be 18 kids there but based on the
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
idea which was written in one of the
 
02:31:21.270 --> 02:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
very early versions of
 
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
of this language i think back during the
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
budget process is that we anticipate an
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
average daily census of 12
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
but that given the need to separate
 
02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
three different groups two different
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
groups for male one for female that you
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
need some excess capacity because you're
 
02:31:35.190 --> 02:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
not going to have an exact number of
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
females in the two different groups on
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
any given day you need some flexibility
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
in spacing i think that's what the data
 
02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
to date shows and and to the extent that
 
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
the argument is that um there's been a
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
lot of analysis to point to a lower
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
number um you know when i first got here
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
people were talking about building a
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
facility for 40
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
right that's only three i've only been
 
02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
here for
 
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
four and a half years at this point um
 
02:31:57.270 --> 02:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
people were talking about building three
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
different facilities in the state at 20
 
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
a piece i mean there are lots of ideas
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
being floated around
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we've gone from about
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
75 kids when i arrived in this state to
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
an average of 12 i think is pretty
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
remarkable progress and when i talk to
 
02:32:11.429 --> 02:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
my colleagues around the country they're
 
02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
shocked by that progress
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
but i haven't seen the evidence yet
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
that we're at a place where we can
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
operate with sex and again i point back
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
to the reality that that dcyf sysc
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
does not decide who goes to this
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
facility judges decide that
 
02:32:31.429 --> 02:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
prosecutors impact that public defenders
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
impact that
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
certainly we get asked for
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
probation officers opinions on these
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
cases but we're not the deciders we just
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
have to take all comers no matter what
 
02:32:42.389 --> 02:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
and until i see data that the people who
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
decide these things have us down to
 
02:32:46.230 --> 02:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
operating at six i'd be horribly
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with
 
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so so we've spent uh 32
 
02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
minutes on on this particular topic and
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's a critical topic because it's like
 
02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
the number one cost driver of the whole
 
02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
replacement facility and then it's going
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
to be the cost driver behind the
 
02:33:08.469 --> 02:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
staffing behind it and so it's really
 
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
important that the committee
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
pick an approach to this that
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
works because if we don't pass
 
02:33:17.439 --> 02:33:18.469 align:start position:0%
works because if we don't pass
this

02:33:18.469 --> 02:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:33:18.479 --> 02:33:19.349 align:start position:0%
this
bill

02:33:19.349 --> 02:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
there's no plan uh the sununu center by
 
02:33:24.790 --> 02:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
law has to just shut down at the end of
 
02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:25.910 align:start position:0%
law has to just shut down at the end of
march

02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
march
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh there there is no continuity of
 
02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
operations without this bill
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
it would be irresponsible for is to not
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
pass this bill
 
02:33:39.190 --> 02:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
and we can't pass this bill unless we
 
02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
agree on a number
 
02:33:43.270 --> 02:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
so what i think i'm going to do is i'm
 
02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
going to put us into
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
a recess for five minutes so that we can
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:37.590 --> 02:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
okay we're out of uh recess for our
 
02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:39.190 align:start position:0%
okay we're out of uh recess for our
caucuses

02:55:39.190 --> 02:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
caucuses
 
02:55:42.230 --> 02:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:55:45.590 --> 02:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
what uh we're going to discuss next is
 
02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:47.190 align:start position:0%
what uh we're going to discuss next is
uh

02:55:47.190 --> 02:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:55:49.590 --> 02:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 458
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%

02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
i'd move we
 
02:56:10.389 --> 02:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%

blurb uh there will not be a minority
report

02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
this ripple is was there was no
 
02:58:03.670 --> 02:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
amendment prepared for 459 right i don't
 
02:58:05.750 --> 02:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
think there was there wasn't okay
 
02:58:08.150 --> 02:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
so uh we have a
 
02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:11.200 align:start position:0%

02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:58:43.190 --> 02:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:45.429 --> 02:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
we'll wait for mr ripple to return to
 
02:59:36.230 --> 02:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:53.190 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

and uh i i sent this out
 
03:03:49.990 --> 03:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
last night
 
03:03:52.630 --> 03:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
you got a copy of it represented walnut
 
03:03:54.630 --> 03:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
from last night
 
03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
did you did you see that from last night

03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:02.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:04:02.469 --> 03:04:02.479 align:start position:0%

sure that i had provided her a digital
 
03:04:08.469 --> 03:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
copy last night
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
i think i'd like to walk through this
 
03:04:20.070 --> 03:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
and then have some discussion
 
03:04:23.910 --> 03:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
at the appropriate times the
 
03:04:27.510 --> 03:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
the first thing that uh that i suggest
 
03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
we do
 
03:04:32.469 --> 03:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
is the definition of workplace violence
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
03:04:36.150 --> 03:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
was so broad it no longer meant
 
03:04:38.070 --> 03:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
workplace violence it meant something
 
03:04:38.080 --> 03:04:39.349 align:start position:0%
workplace violence it meant something
else

03:04:39.349 --> 03:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
else
 
03:04:42.070 --> 03:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
so it included
 
03:04:45.110 --> 03:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh verbal abuse even if the victim
 
03:04:47.110 --> 03:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
had no stress
 
03:04:49.750 --> 03:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
so so so that didn't seem to make sense
 
03:04:49.760 --> 03:04:50.469 align:start position:0%
so so so that didn't seem to make sense
so

03:04:50.469 --> 03:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
tightened up workplace violence so that
 
03:04:55.750 --> 03:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
a normal person would understand the
 
03:04:58.070 --> 03:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
word violence and then created a new
 
03:04:58.080 --> 03:04:59.349 align:start position:0%
word violence and then created a new
definition

03:04:59.349 --> 03:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
definition
 
03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
for hostile words hostile words means
 
03:05:03.670 --> 03:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
aggressive belligerent verbal abuse in
 
03:05:06.070 --> 03:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
which the recipient reasonably believes
 
03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
that the speaker intends to injure or
 
03:05:08.160 --> 03:05:09.190 align:start position:0%
that the speaker intends to injure or
create

03:05:09.190 --> 03:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
create
 
03:05:11.269 --> 03:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
excessive stress or in which the
 
03:05:14.790 --> 03:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
recipient suffers psychological trauma
 
03:05:16.710 --> 03:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not wedded to that particular
 
03:05:18.950 --> 03:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
definition but i am sort of wedded to
 
03:05:20.790 --> 03:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
the concept of
 
03:05:23.910 --> 03:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
of breaking workplace violence up
 
03:05:27.670 --> 03:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
into um a distinct subsect because
 
03:05:29.990 --> 03:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
initially it's just it's just so broad
 
03:05:32.950 --> 03:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean anything any comment on
 
03:05:32.960 --> 03:05:34.550 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean anything any comment on
that

03:05:34.550 --> 03:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
03:05:36.960 --> 03:05:38.469 align:start position:0%
i agree
representative

03:05:38.469 --> 03:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:05:40.230 --> 03:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
03:05:42.469 --> 03:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
again you know i don't
 
03:05:44.309 --> 03:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not on criminal i don't do criminal
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
work usually but often in the law
 
03:05:50.070 --> 03:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
specific words have developed specific
 
03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
meanings their specific definitions are
 
03:05:53.670 --> 03:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
out there on specific meanings
 
03:05:55.830 --> 03:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to understand where this
 
03:05:58.630 --> 03:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
definition of hostile words came from is
 
03:05:59.830 --> 03:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
that a
 
03:06:02.309 --> 03:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
widely accepted definition i said i
 
03:06:03.510 --> 03:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
invented it
 
03:06:05.429 --> 03:06:05.439 align:start position:0%
you invented it yeah i believe i said
 
03:06:05.439 --> 03:06:06.150 align:start position:0%
you invented it yeah i believe i said
that

03:06:06.150 --> 03:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:06:08.469 --> 03:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
i i wrote that because
 
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh workplace violence was uh so
 
03:06:13.030 --> 03:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
inclusive it needed to be broken out so
 
03:06:15.269 --> 03:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
i i wrote the definition of hostile
 
03:06:15.279 --> 03:06:16.230 align:start position:0%
i i wrote the definition of hostile
words

03:06:16.230 --> 03:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
words
 
03:06:20.309 --> 03:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
so the question i have is
 
03:06:21.590 --> 03:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
has this been through legislative
 
03:06:21.600 --> 03:06:25.190 align:start position:0%
has this been through legislative
services

03:06:25.190 --> 03:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:29.030 --> 03:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
no okay well no the re there's
 
03:06:30.870 --> 03:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
discussion that's great
 
03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
there's a reason i'm asking that and
 
03:06:33.670 --> 03:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know i i just want to be careful
 
03:06:37.750 --> 03:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
when we're inventing definitions in the
 
03:06:37.760 --> 03:06:38.550 align:start position:0%
when we're inventing definitions in the
law

03:06:38.550 --> 03:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:06:40.870 --> 03:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
that we're not changing definitions that
 
03:06:42.710 --> 03:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
are out there in another part of the law
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
and inconsistent with it because there
 
03:06:47.190 --> 03:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
are words that have come to have meaning
 
03:06:49.349 --> 03:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
and that meaning is across the board in
 
03:06:51.750 --> 03:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
lots of different crimes or civil
 
03:06:51.760 --> 03:06:52.710 align:start position:0%
lots of different crimes or civil
actions

03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
actions
 
03:06:52.720 --> 03:06:53.590 align:start position:0%
actions
and

03:06:53.590 --> 03:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:06:55.990 --> 03:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
when we invent new words i just out of
 
03:06:58.630 --> 03:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
an interest in time i agree with you and
 
03:07:00.870 --> 03:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this is to discuss it the
 
03:07:03.510 --> 03:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
pro and it will need to go through oos
 
03:07:05.990 --> 03:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
before we have a draft so i think you're
 
03:07:07.830 --> 03:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about finding alternative
 
03:07:09.990 --> 03:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
definitions that are already in the law
 
03:07:11.590 --> 03:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
we can do that when we run this through
 
03:07:14.469 --> 03:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
ols as you recall this bill was voted
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
out on thursday and we have no time to
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
really do this the justices needs i'd be
 
03:07:21.910 --> 03:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
open to interim study this bill and then
 
03:07:24.790 --> 03:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
we could have all kinds of times
 
03:07:26.790 --> 03:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not open to interim studying it
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
because i think it's urgent that we
 
03:07:30.389 --> 03:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
protect our health care workers but
 
03:07:32.950 --> 03:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
before we do this i just was looking to
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
find out if somebody who knows more
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
about criminal law than i do
 
03:07:39.190 --> 03:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
could help me understand
 
03:07:41.269 --> 03:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
if it may be great that you've invented
 
03:07:42.870 --> 03:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
this all the whole cloth and it may work
 
03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
just fine right here i'm not saying it
 
03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't i'm just saying we need to find
 
03:07:46.800 --> 03:07:48.790 align:start position:0%
doesn't i'm just saying we need to find
out

03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:07:51.110 --> 03:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
how about the where i started though
 
03:07:52.790 --> 03:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
did do you agree with the way the
 
03:07:55.670 --> 03:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
workplace violence was defined in the uh
 
03:07:57.750 --> 03:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
in the bill that we received
 
03:07:59.990 --> 03:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
workplace violence means any act or
 
03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
threat of physical violence harassment
 
03:08:04.630 --> 03:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
intimidation or other threatening
 
03:08:07.110 --> 03:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
behavior that occurs at a health care
 
03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
facility including verbal abuse without
 
03:08:13.030 --> 03:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
regard whether the victim sustains an
 
03:08:17.269 --> 03:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
injury psychological trauma or stress
 
03:08:20.150 --> 03:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
if a victim has no stress from words is
 
03:08:26.230 --> 03:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:29.670 --> 03:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
what jumps at me with my legal mind is
 
03:08:31.349 --> 03:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
some of these things require something
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
called men's rhea which in english it
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
means intent and was this
 
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
language an attempt to
 
03:08:40.389 --> 03:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
address a need for intent i don't know
 
03:08:42.389 --> 03:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
the answer to this but i look at this
 
03:08:45.429 --> 03:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
with different eyes than you do
 
03:08:48.070 --> 03:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
because of my training and it just
 
03:08:49.910 --> 03:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
raises questions for me and i'm not
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
trying to be critical of what you did
 
03:08:55.269 --> 03:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
i think words are there for a reason and
 
03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
having gotten this the last minute i
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:09:00.630 --> 03:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
if by taking those words out we're
 
03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
taking out an element that has
 
03:09:04.630 --> 03:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that's all i'm
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
trying to say i'm not saying i agree or
 
03:09:08.950 --> 03:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
disagree with them i'm just saying
 
03:09:10.950 --> 03:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
without knowing the history of how that
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
definition got there and what the intent
 
03:09:16.070 --> 03:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
was of what what's the waterfront they
 
03:09:18.230 --> 03:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
were trying to cover with those words
 
03:09:20.150 --> 03:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
i'm reluctant to change it without
 
03:09:25.030 --> 03:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:26.150 --> 03:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
is there any other comment on the
 
03:09:31.269 --> 03:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:33.269 --> 03:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
all right i think it leaves it so broad
 
03:09:35.670 --> 03:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
that if a nurse walks into a room and
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
the person turns their back on them and
 
03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
ignores them
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
some might say that's a hostile act so
 
03:09:47.349 --> 03:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
for what it's worth i agree with your
 
03:09:48.560 --> 03:09:50.710 align:start position:0%
for what it's worth i agree with your
definitions

03:09:50.710 --> 03:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
03:09:51.670 --> 03:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
um so then in two i'm just looking at it
 
03:09:57.110 --> 03:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what i what i did
 
03:09:59.830 --> 03:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
here i created a new
 
03:10:01.910 --> 03:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph 4 and that caused some
 
03:10:01.920 --> 03:10:03.269 align:start position:0%
paragraph 4 and that caused some
remembering

03:10:03.269 --> 03:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
remembering
 
03:10:03.279 --> 03:10:06.229 align:start position:0%
remembering
said

03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:08.309 --> 03:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
health facilities
 
03:10:11.349 --> 03:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
may implement and maintain a workplace
 
03:10:13.349 --> 03:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
violence prevention program
 
03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
so this gets right at the issue of
 
03:10:21.110 --> 03:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the financial impact of this policy
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
is that this has been set up to be
 
03:10:26.150 --> 03:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
mandatory where the straight state is
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
directing that these programs take place
 
03:10:32.469 --> 03:10:32.479 align:start position:0%
and we saw that when it just looked at
 
03:10:34.630 --> 03:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
our two hospitals without
 
03:10:37.030 --> 03:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
regard to the third that will be opening
 
03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh if everything goes well
 
03:10:39.359 --> 03:10:40.389 align:start position:0%
uh if everything goes well
um

03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:40.399 --> 03:10:41.110 align:start position:0%
um
it

03:10:41.110 --> 03:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:10:45.030 --> 03:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
it adds an fte per facility in order to
 
03:10:47.429 --> 03:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
run these internal programs
 
03:10:50.950 --> 03:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
so uh so what what i did here
 
03:10:54.389 --> 03:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
was basically say that participation
 
03:10:54.399 --> 03:10:55.110 align:start position:0%
was basically say that participation
in

03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:10:55.120 --> 03:10:55.830 align:start position:0%
in
an

03:10:55.830 --> 03:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:10:58.229 --> 03:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
internal workplace violence program
 
03:10:59.429 --> 03:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
having one
 
03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
is a
 
03:11:03.429 --> 03:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
is not mandated by this program but it
 
03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.910 --> 03:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
said program may consider the size and
 
03:11:13.830 --> 03:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
complexity of the health facility and
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
shall address
 
03:11:18.630 --> 03:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
the following topics or others deemed
 
03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate by the health facility the
 
03:11:22.870 --> 03:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
goal of which is to encourage
 
03:11:22.880 --> 03:11:24.389 align:start position:0%
goal of which is to encourage
participation

03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
participation
 
03:11:26.790 --> 03:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
and address prevention recognition
 
03:11:28.950 --> 03:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
response and reporting of workplace
 
03:11:28.960 --> 03:11:31.910 align:start position:0%
response and reporting of workplace
violence

03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
so it maintains the program
 
03:11:36.389 --> 03:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
by including
 
03:11:38.469 --> 03:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
the elements that would have been in the
 
03:11:40.950 --> 03:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
program but rather than making them
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
mandatory it makes them suggestive and
 
03:11:45.510 --> 03:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
it also opens it up so
 
03:11:48.469 --> 03:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
that it it it can be more the program
 
03:11:52.790 --> 03:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
could be more than what was described
 
03:11:55.750 --> 03:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
is there any comment about just strictly
 
03:11:58.870 --> 03:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
limiting for a second the conversation
 
03:11:58.880 --> 03:11:59.750 align:start position:0%
limiting for a second the conversation
on

03:11:59.750 --> 03:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:12:04.309 --> 03:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
voluntary or versus mandatory
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
requirements to have an internal
 
03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
workplace violence program
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
and before anyone talks i care deeply
 
03:12:15.269 --> 03:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
about violence in a healthcare workplace
 
03:12:18.229 --> 03:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
i've worked 43 years in hospitals i've
 
03:12:19.750 --> 03:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
seen it
 
03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:20.630 align:start position:0%
seen it
and

03:12:20.630 --> 03:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:12:23.030 --> 03:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
i i think health care administrators
 
03:12:26.070 --> 03:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
want to preclude this anyways
 
03:12:28.950 --> 03:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative walls
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
i think changing your first shale to
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
make guts the program i think it makes
 
03:12:35.190 --> 03:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
it meaningless and it eliminates the
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
protections that this bill is trying to
 
03:12:38.870 --> 03:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
provide to our health care workers i
 
03:12:41.030 --> 03:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
think some of the other maze that you've
 
03:12:42.309 --> 03:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
done i mean i kind of went through as
 
03:12:43.830 --> 03:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
much of this as i could read in the time
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
allotted because i didn't see it until
 
03:12:47.110 --> 03:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:12:49.349 --> 03:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
some of the mays are
 
03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
acceptable but that one in particular i
 
03:12:53.510 --> 03:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
think that just guts it and i think if
 
03:12:56.630 --> 03:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
we don't require a facility to have a
 
03:12:58.870 --> 03:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
workplace prevention program we might as
 
03:13:01.030 --> 03:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
well not even be passing this because
 
03:13:02.950 --> 03:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
they can do this without us so saying
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
may that already exists what we're
 
03:13:06.550 --> 03:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is provide the
 
03:13:07.750 --> 03:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
protection and the way we're going to
 
03:13:12.389 --> 03:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:19.590 --> 03:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
the nurses lobbyist called me to say
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
that they felt
 
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't required it wouldn't be
 
03:13:25.349 --> 03:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
done but i see you have language in here
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
to require a report so if they don't
 
03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
bring in the program they have to report
 
03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
why which may put pressure on them to
 
03:13:37.429 --> 03:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
bring in the program especially if you
 
03:13:40.229 --> 03:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
create a lengthy thing to describe why
 
03:13:42.389 --> 03:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
don't you have such a program and what
 
03:13:44.150 --> 03:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
is your experience if you put that in
 
03:13:46.469 --> 03:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
there to to try to explain it force them
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
to makes a decision i think
 
03:13:53.910 --> 03:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
so the totality of it was meant to
 
03:13:53.920 --> 03:13:55.269 align:start position:0%
so the totality of it was meant to
create

03:13:55.269 --> 03:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
create
 
03:13:57.190 --> 03:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
a bottoms up
 
03:14:00.469 --> 03:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
free market of criticism and pressure
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
instead of a top-down
 
03:14:04.870 --> 03:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
directive mandate
 
03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
from a government
 
03:14:09.990 --> 03:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
and so in a live free or die state when
 
03:14:12.870 --> 03:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
i heard so much about how everyone wants
 
03:14:15.429 --> 03:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
to do this and everyone cares
 
03:14:18.389 --> 03:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to me like a mandate is
 
03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
necessary what is needed is guidance and
 
03:14:21.840 --> 03:14:23.110 align:start position:0%
necessary what is needed is guidance and
leadership

03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
03:14:24.870 --> 03:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
and and that's what
 
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
i attempted to do with this rewrite
 
03:14:31.030 --> 03:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative irf
 
03:14:33.910 --> 03:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so i agree
 
03:14:35.590 --> 03:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't seem
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
like a mandate is necessary however one
 
03:14:40.229 --> 03:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
of the things that we heard the other
 
03:14:40.239 --> 03:14:41.190 align:start position:0%
of the things that we heard the other
day

03:14:41.190 --> 03:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:14:43.190 --> 03:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
had something to do with the legal
 
03:14:45.429 --> 03:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
gymnastics of it and and i can't speak
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
to that directly i'm sure there's
 
03:14:48.790 --> 03:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
somebody here who can but i did speak
 
03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
probably with the same lobbyist that
 
03:14:52.229 --> 03:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
representative wallner spoke to
 
03:14:54.070 --> 03:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
regarding how we could get
 
03:14:56.389 --> 03:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
i think all the way to what you want but
 
03:14:58.870 --> 03:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
without removing the word mandate
 
03:15:02.070 --> 03:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
so in the course of that conversation
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
i asked so is everybody are all the
 
03:15:06.150 --> 03:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals on board and i believe the
 
03:15:08.229 --> 03:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
answer we got to that last
 
03:15:11.590 --> 03:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday last week last week
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
was yes
 
03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
okay i said how about all the urgent
 
03:15:15.670 --> 03:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
care centers
 
03:15:18.469 --> 03:15:18.479 align:start position:0%
no the two biggest ones are
 
03:15:20.389 --> 03:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
and the three that are less have fewer
 
03:15:21.830 --> 03:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
than three clinics i don't know if
 
03:15:23.269 --> 03:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
they're not or they're or they're they
 
03:15:25.510 --> 03:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
haven't responded but in any case uh the
 
03:15:27.510 --> 03:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion was made to
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
as is already in the bill later on
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
relating to the members of the
 
03:15:34.150 --> 03:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
commission uh the members for the health
 
03:15:35.910 --> 03:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
the urgent cares as i recall come from
 
03:15:38.070 --> 03:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
the those with larger than three clin
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
with more than three clinics the
 
03:15:41.190 --> 03:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion was made to put that same
 
03:15:43.269 --> 03:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
wording up into the definition of
 
03:15:45.429 --> 03:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
healthcare facility and in fact i guess
 
03:15:47.190 --> 03:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
i can probably read you the language
 
03:15:48.630 --> 03:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
better if you want to hear the actual
 
03:15:48.640 --> 03:15:51.349 align:start position:0%
better if you want to hear the actual
language

03:15:51.349 --> 03:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:51.359 --> 03:15:54.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:15:54.309 --> 03:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:55.990 --> 03:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
health facility
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
as it's currently stated with another
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
sentence the term does not include any
 
03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:01.830 align:start position:0%
sentence the term does not include any
non-hospital

03:16:01.830 --> 03:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
non-hospital
 
03:16:04.070 --> 03:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
urgent care with less than three clinics
 
03:16:06.469 --> 03:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so with that my
 
03:16:08.710 --> 03:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is there's nobody that
 
03:16:10.790 --> 03:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
would be affected by this that doesn't
 
03:16:12.229 --> 03:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
want to be affected by it except for the
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
state perhaps i'll come back to that
 
03:16:16.150 --> 03:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
so that gets rid of the yes it's still
 
03:16:18.550 --> 03:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
mandatory but
 
03:16:20.950 --> 03:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
but everybody wants to be in
 
03:16:22.229 --> 03:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
give one second i'll get back to where i
 
03:16:24.389 --> 03:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
was i've heard that but i've actually
 
03:16:27.269 --> 03:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
not seen any documentation to show each
 
03:16:30.150 --> 03:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
facility has said that they want to be
 
03:16:32.469 --> 03:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
in this i've heard it said but i've not
 
03:16:33.830 --> 03:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
seen it
 
03:16:35.349 --> 03:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
i'll let others speak to that let me let
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
me go through the things i think we need
 
03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
to change and then you can have people
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
up to speak to that i obviously i can't
 
03:16:42.710 --> 03:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
speak to that myself and personally
 
03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay um so as you have
 
03:16:46.790 --> 03:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
suggested we need to remove all
 
03:16:48.710 --> 03:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable identifiable
 
03:16:49.670 --> 03:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
information i mean there's any
 
03:16:51.590 --> 03:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
disagreement from the reports that are
 
03:16:52.950 --> 03:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
produced i don't think there's any
 
03:16:54.469 --> 03:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
disagreement about that
 
03:16:56.469 --> 03:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
strike the two thousand dollar fine and
 
03:16:57.910 --> 03:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
by that essentially you're making it
 
03:17:00.309 --> 03:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
voluntary because if anybody
 
03:17:02.229 --> 03:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't get involved
 
03:17:03.510 --> 03:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get fined what's
 
03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
going to happen so you're so that gives
 
03:17:07.429 --> 03:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
you back to your goal if nobody has to
 
03:17:10.630 --> 03:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
be in there they want to be in there
 
03:17:12.229 --> 03:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
include your definitions of workplace
 
03:17:13.830 --> 03:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
violence and hostile words and then of
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
course get hostile words into the proper
 
03:17:17.670 --> 03:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
places in the document and i have one
 
03:17:19.030 --> 03:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
sample cut at that which i was going to
 
03:17:20.790 --> 03:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
send to mr ripple later
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
today maintain your repeal date um i
 
03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
think it was in 10 years or something so
 
03:17:28.870 --> 03:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
so keep that let whatever it is
 
03:17:30.550 --> 03:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
so that the program can be looked at as
 
03:17:31.990 --> 03:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
you suggest in that time frame and see
 
03:17:33.750 --> 03:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
if it still needs to be
 
03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
in place
 
03:17:37.110 --> 03:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
and if we all feel it's appropriate
 
03:17:38.950 --> 03:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
remove state facilities they apparently
 
03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
have very good programs already and that
 
03:17:42.950 --> 03:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the cost and they they
 
03:17:44.950 --> 03:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
could be optionally invited to attend so
 
03:17:47.110 --> 03:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
would you do that in a as you're
 
03:17:48.950 --> 03:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
redefining the definition of health
 
03:17:48.960 --> 03:17:50.550 align:start position:0%
redefining the definition of health
facility

03:17:50.550 --> 03:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
i mean where would that happen yeah sure
 
03:17:54.710 --> 03:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
i mean you're you're talking about how
 
03:17:57.030 --> 03:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
you would limit the size of the urgent
 
03:18:00.150 --> 03:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
care centers and we could uh in that
 
03:18:03.110 --> 03:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
definition actually exclude state yeah
 
03:18:05.190 --> 03:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
yes and i actually asked uh kevin again
 
03:18:07.349 --> 03:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
i asked mitch ripple about this he did
 
03:18:09.190 --> 03:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
this didn't have time to do it today but
 
03:18:11.190 --> 03:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
the idea would be to not only include
 
03:18:13.190 --> 03:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
nhh and and uh
 
03:18:15.269 --> 03:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
glencliff home obviously also hamsa will
 
03:18:16.630 --> 03:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
be coming on board but it should be
 
03:18:18.150 --> 03:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
general enough that any future state
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
facility doesn't have to be involved and
 
03:18:23.429 --> 03:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate wording to let them opt in
 
03:18:25.190 --> 03:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
so i think that's all of the items that
 
03:18:27.269 --> 03:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
would turn it into something closer to
 
03:18:29.030 --> 03:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for without the word
 
03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
mandate and if i missed anything perhaps
 
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
the other folks that speak to it but i
 
03:18:34.550 --> 03:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
think you could speak to the people here
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
that could give you some confidence
 
03:18:38.309 --> 03:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
about the
 
03:18:39.830 --> 03:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
the people that
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
really want to be into the in this and
 
03:18:43.349 --> 03:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
why they want to be in it thank you mr
 
03:18:43.359 --> 03:18:48.150 align:start position:0%
why they want to be in it thank you mr
chair

03:18:48.150 --> 03:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:51.670 --> 03:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
so i added into this references to
 
03:18:55.429 --> 03:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh rsa 354a right to freedom from
 
03:18:57.910 --> 03:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination in public workplaces
 
03:18:59.190 --> 03:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
because i
 
03:19:00.389 --> 03:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
helps clarify
 
03:19:05.910 --> 03:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
the expectations of behavior towards one
 
03:19:05.920 --> 03:19:07.190 align:start position:0%
the expectations of behavior towards one
another

03:19:07.190 --> 03:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:19.269 --> 03:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
would you
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
if we recast this more along the lines
 
03:19:24.229 --> 03:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
that you're suggesting would you keep uh
 
03:19:25.590 --> 03:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
the part here
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
on the second page where
 
03:19:28.630 --> 03:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
it says
 
03:19:30.550 --> 03:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
health facilities opting out of
 
03:19:32.550 --> 03:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
participation with the new hampshire
 
03:19:35.190 --> 03:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
health care workplace safety commission
 
03:19:37.349 --> 03:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
shall submit a written notification
 
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
within 15 days of the effective date of
 
03:19:41.830 --> 03:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
03:19:44.950 --> 03:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
stating their decision to opt out
 
03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
would you keep that
 
03:19:49.510 --> 03:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
sure i mean are you basically saying if
 
03:19:51.990 --> 03:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
any of the facilities um
 
03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:52.950 align:start position:0%
any of the facilities um
that

03:19:52.950 --> 03:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:19:54.630 --> 03:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
just wanted to jump out without being
 
03:19:54.640 --> 03:19:55.990 align:start position:0%
just wanted to jump out without being
fined

03:19:55.990 --> 03:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
fined
 
03:19:57.910 --> 03:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
you want this out of them from them is
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying
 
03:20:03.510 --> 03:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know does it become um
 
03:20:06.550 --> 03:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
superfluous to have them sign a document
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
opting out if
 
03:20:10.710 --> 03:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
if your observation is correct and it
 
03:20:13.030 --> 03:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
basically becomes voluntary without any
 
03:20:15.750 --> 03:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
fines anyways i i guess i will leave it
 
03:20:17.110 --> 03:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the committed i mean i
 
03:20:18.229 --> 03:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
have no problem with that being in there
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
leave it to the rest of the committee
 
03:20:21.990 --> 03:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
determined if that's
 
03:20:24.150 --> 03:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
representing weiler do you have an uh an
 
03:20:24.160 --> 03:20:26.710 align:start position:0%
representing weiler do you have an uh an
opinion

03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:38.630 --> 03:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:40.469 --> 03:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
having their submit something in writing
 
03:20:42.070 --> 03:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
then they can't deny that it's been
 
03:20:45.030 --> 03:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
offered and then their employees can say
 
03:20:46.950 --> 03:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
why did can look at what they offered
 
03:20:48.229 --> 03:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
and say why
 
03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
make you make them explain
 
03:20:51.830 --> 03:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments on this
 
03:20:51.840 --> 03:20:53.910 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments on this
point

03:20:53.910 --> 03:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative walsh just can you tell
 
03:20:57.429 --> 03:20:57.439 align:start position:0%
me i'm not exactly sure which paragraph
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
03:21:01.110 --> 03:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's a little hard because this
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
isn't numbered it turns out to be the
 
03:21:06.630 --> 03:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
second page if you flip it over and if
 
03:21:09.030 --> 03:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
you go down about 60 percent it says
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
renumber from here before
 
03:21:13.830 --> 03:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities opting out of
 
03:21:16.870 --> 03:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
participation that that section
 
03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
basic basically i'm saying you know if a
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
hospital or or one of these covered
 
03:21:25.110 --> 03:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
entities don't want to participate they
 
03:21:27.590 --> 03:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
would be expected to
 
03:21:29.510 --> 03:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
say so in writing
 
03:21:32.229 --> 03:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
that is meant to bring public pressure
 
03:21:33.670 --> 03:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
on them
 
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:21:37.510 --> 03:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
they would have a bottoms-up approach
 
03:21:37.520 --> 03:21:38.469 align:start position:0%
they would have a bottoms-up approach
to

03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:21:40.389 --> 03:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
wanting to participate
 
03:21:44.950 --> 03:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:44.960 --> 03:21:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:47.910 --> 03:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
today when there's a shortage of health
 
03:21:49.510 --> 03:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
care workers out there
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
i agree health care workers are going to
 
03:21:53.110 --> 03:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
be inclined to look at something like
 
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
this and go maybe this is not where i
 
03:21:56.389 --> 03:21:56.399 align:start position:0%
want to work but we're educating
 
03:21:58.150 --> 03:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers like crazy and maybe
 
03:21:59.830 --> 03:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
in five or ten years we're going to have
 
03:22:03.429 --> 03:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of health care workers and i
 
03:22:05.750 --> 03:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
would like to just
 
03:22:07.269 --> 03:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem with mandating
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
this i think we need to protect workers
 
03:22:09.680 --> 03:22:10.630 align:start position:0%
this i think we need to protect workers
period

03:22:10.630 --> 03:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:22:12.790 --> 03:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:22:14.150 --> 03:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
i think there are always going to be
 
03:22:15.429 --> 03:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
people willing to work at those
 
03:22:17.910 --> 03:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
facilities that don't have the safety
 
03:22:20.469 --> 03:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
provisions in place and then they're
 
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
going to be victimized they're they're
 
03:22:23.349 --> 03:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
going to get hurt somebody's going to
 
03:22:26.710 --> 03:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
hurt them i think we should be mandating
 
03:22:29.190 --> 03:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's just my belief i just think so
 
03:22:30.870 --> 03:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
should we extend the mandate to home
 
03:22:30.880 --> 03:22:32.710 align:start position:0%
should we extend the mandate to home
depot

03:22:32.710 --> 03:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
depot
 
03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
do you care equally about uh all workers
 
03:22:38.070 --> 03:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
or are we just doing a carve out for
 
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
health care and treating them as a
 
03:22:42.070 --> 03:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
separate part of society
 
03:22:43.510 --> 03:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think there's social and other things
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
that address home depot i'm just talking
 
03:22:47.110 --> 03:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
about right now health care workers
 
03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
and i'd be interested in hearing what
 
03:22:52.309 --> 03:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative earth is trying to say
 
03:22:54.790 --> 03:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
my comments were related to the existing
 
03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
bill so there would be a mandate
 
03:22:58.630 --> 03:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
the modifications i was talking about
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
were to the existing bill
 
03:23:03.190 --> 03:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
not to not to represent ezra's bills and
 
03:23:05.590 --> 03:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
that what he was asking was of the items
 
03:23:07.269 --> 03:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
that are in his
 
03:23:09.190 --> 03:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
proposal would we keep
 
03:23:11.870 --> 03:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
for instance education rsa
 
03:23:14.309 --> 03:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
354-a colon 29
 
03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
etc and would we keep the health
 
03:23:18.550 --> 03:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
facilities so the idea is that we would
 
03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
stick with the mandate that was that was
 
03:23:22.229 --> 03:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
everything i was describing
 
03:23:23.830 --> 03:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
when my conversations with the with the
 
03:23:25.750 --> 03:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
lobbyists that they were willing to
 
03:23:25.760 --> 03:23:27.110 align:start position:0%
lobbyists that they were willing to
basically

03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:23:28.229 --> 03:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
change those things and there was
 
03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
essentially a voluntary mandatory system
 
03:23:32.790 --> 03:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
i can't remember what the words were
 
03:23:34.389 --> 03:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
they they used was actually something
 
03:23:34.399 --> 03:23:35.429 align:start position:0%
they they used was actually something
like

03:23:35.429 --> 03:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:23:38.870 --> 03:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:42.830 --> 03:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
if we have mass speak i don't want to be
 
03:23:45.269 --> 03:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
unrecognized okay thank you i didn't
 
03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
need to jump the gun um
 
03:23:50.389 --> 03:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
so the idea is to have it be
 
03:23:52.469 --> 03:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
mandatory for pry facility private
 
03:23:54.630 --> 03:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
facilities but voluntary for state
 
03:23:56.630 --> 03:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
facilities is that my understanding well
 
03:23:58.309 --> 03:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
the suggestion was again this came from
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
the lobbyists if we're concerned about
 
03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
the cost the only cost in the bill is
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
the state facility saying they have to
 
03:24:06.070 --> 03:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
have people
 
03:24:06.080 --> 03:24:07.030 align:start position:0%
have people
so

03:24:07.030 --> 03:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:24:08.229 --> 03:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the state has a
 
03:24:09.910 --> 03:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
pretty good it has pretty good programs
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
in place so if we the committee decide
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the cost all we have to do
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
is say the states don't have the state
 
03:24:17.590 --> 03:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
facilities don't have to be part of the
 
03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:18.870 align:start position:0%
facilities don't have to be part of the
mandatory

03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
03:24:20.150 --> 03:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh they can be an exception to the
 
03:24:21.750 --> 03:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory demand
 
03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering matt
 
03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:25.429 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering matt
mattha

03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
mattha
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
may i follow up yes so what about if we
 
03:24:30.469 --> 03:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
say state facilities run by the state
 
03:24:32.469 --> 03:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
but if the state facilities are run by a
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
private entity then they're subject to
 
03:24:34.560 --> 03:24:35.349 align:start position:0%
private entity then they're subject to
this

03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
so that if we're talking about state
 
03:24:39.110 --> 03:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
employees that's exempt but if the state
 
03:24:40.870 --> 03:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
has contracted out the running one of
 
03:24:42.870 --> 03:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
these facilities to a private entity
 
03:24:44.229 --> 03:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
what would you think about then making
 
03:24:48.229 --> 03:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
i don't want any of this mandatory so
 
03:24:52.950 --> 03:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm all i'm already being drugged
 
03:24:56.870 --> 03:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
through the razor wire okay uh
 
03:24:59.510 --> 03:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
this this this is not why i got shot at
 
03:25:01.750 --> 03:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
is to tell hospitals that they have to
 
03:25:04.150 --> 03:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
do a program that is common sense that
 
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
they ought to do
 
03:25:05.680 --> 03:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
they ought to do
but

03:25:07.590 --> 03:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i cannot get over the fact
 
03:25:12.469 --> 03:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
of the story that i was told as i told
 
03:25:13.990 --> 03:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
you two weeks ago about two
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
strangulations at dartmouth-hitchcock
 
03:25:19.030 --> 03:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
two not one but two and they still don't
 
03:25:22.150 --> 03:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
have the the safety precautions in place
 
03:25:24.309 --> 03:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
to ensure that doesn't happen i mean
 
03:25:25.910 --> 03:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
these are serious things that are
 
03:25:27.670 --> 03:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
happening in what's probably the best
 
03:25:30.389 --> 03:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
hospital in the state and they
 
03:25:31.750 --> 03:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
should have the money and they should
 
03:25:33.190 --> 03:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
have the motivation to protect their
 
03:25:35.590 --> 03:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
workers and they're not
 
03:25:37.510 --> 03:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
let me for the record state that i'm
 
03:25:41.349 --> 03:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to strangulation of anyone
 
03:25:45.429 --> 03:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh i and i think that an institution as
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
wealthy and as enlightened as dartmouth
 
03:25:50.070 --> 03:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
would be all over this that they don't
 
03:25:52.870 --> 03:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
need the state to do this to them right
 
03:25:54.550 --> 03:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
but but they're not maybe maybe i'm
 
03:25:57.750 --> 03:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
naive i just think better of people um
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
03:26:01.510 --> 03:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh let's let's
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
just just to point out what
 
03:26:06.150 --> 03:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative erf has suggested and
 
03:26:08.550 --> 03:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
which has changed things is where on the
 
03:26:11.590 --> 03:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
first page in section two
 
03:26:14.950 --> 03:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
where it reads where i deleted the word
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
shall and inserted may
 
03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:19.670 align:start position:0%
shall and inserted may
earth

03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
earth
 
03:26:21.830 --> 03:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
would like to keep shall
 
03:26:24.389 --> 03:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
and get rid of may so the shall would
 
03:26:26.550 --> 03:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
remain and so what we were trying to do
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
is crosswalk the rest of this
 
03:26:31.510 --> 03:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
to see if there are any good components
 
03:26:34.469 --> 03:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
that we ought to keep in the division
 
03:26:38.070 --> 03:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.150 --> 03:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm a little thick and i know
 
03:26:41.910 --> 03:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
you just said this but i want to hear it
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
clearly so we're looking at line
 
03:26:45.600 --> 03:26:46.630 align:start position:0%
clearly so we're looking at line
12

03:26:46.630 --> 03:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
12
 
03:26:48.309 --> 03:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
and the shell there you're suggesting
 
03:26:48.319 --> 03:26:49.269 align:start position:0%
and the shell there you're suggesting
that

03:26:49.269 --> 03:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:26:52.710 --> 03:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
on page 1 line 12 on the original bill
 
03:26:54.229 --> 03:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
wait i don't have that in front of me
 
03:26:54.239 --> 03:26:55.349 align:start position:0%
wait i don't have that in front of me
okay

03:26:55.349 --> 03:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
let me explain to you what he's doing
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
yeah because i'm getting a little lost
 
03:27:01.190 --> 03:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we should start with
 
03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
did everybody understand what i was
 
03:27:04.630 --> 03:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
doing that i was starting from the
 
03:27:06.070 --> 03:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
original bill and making those half a
 
03:27:08.229 --> 03:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
dozen changes to try to make it more of
 
03:27:09.910 --> 03:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
a quote voluntary system with a
 
03:27:12.309 --> 03:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
mandatory word do we get that
 
03:27:14.950 --> 03:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay so if you all are on board with
 
03:27:17.190 --> 03:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
that hopefully
 
03:27:18.870 --> 03:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
so that's our basis we're starting from
 
03:27:20.790 --> 03:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
that point what representative edwards
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
is doing is going through his amendment
 
03:27:26.229 --> 03:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
and suggesting pieces of his amendment
 
03:27:26.239 --> 03:27:27.030 align:start position:0%
and suggesting pieces of his amendment
that

03:27:27.030 --> 03:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:28.229 --> 03:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
would they also be appropriate to be
 
03:27:30.389 --> 03:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
incorporated into
 
03:27:32.710 --> 03:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
the bill as it is
 
03:27:34.229 --> 03:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you does that make sense yeah i'm
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
just i'm sorry i was having a hard time
 
03:27:36.479 --> 03:27:37.590 align:start position:0%
just i'm sorry i was having a hard time
following

03:27:37.590 --> 03:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
following
 
03:27:39.110 --> 03:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you that does help keith thank you
 
03:27:39.120 --> 03:27:40.830 align:start position:0%
thank you that does help keith thank you
very

03:27:40.830 --> 03:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:27:45.030 --> 03:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:45.990 --> 03:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know what other pieces you want
 
03:27:47.349 --> 03:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
to add in i can add i can discuss those
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
two that we talked about you might go
 
03:27:50.790 --> 03:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
through those two or do you want to sure
 
03:27:52.630 --> 03:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
let's just wrap up the two okay so he
 
03:27:52.640 --> 03:27:53.670 align:start position:0%
let's just wrap up the two okay so he
mentioned

03:27:53.670 --> 03:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:27:57.030 --> 03:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
two right off the bat on the second page
 
03:27:58.309 --> 03:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
one of the ones you wanted to keep on
 
03:27:59.510 --> 03:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
the second page is the first thing
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's well the second thing that's
 
03:28:02.309 --> 03:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
heavily bolded it's about eight lines
 
03:28:04.389 --> 03:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
down it has a number two and parens in
 
03:28:06.309 --> 03:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
front of it it relates to freedom from
 
03:28:06.319 --> 03:28:07.590 align:start position:0%
front of it it relates to freedom from
discrimination

03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
03:28:08.870 --> 03:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't personally see a problem
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
with including that in the in the bill
 
03:28:14.150 --> 03:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:16.070 --> 03:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
suggest that they do
 
03:28:18.630 --> 03:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
further down on that same page where
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's what he mentioned earlier the
 
03:28:21.429 --> 03:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
renumber from here and for that that
 
03:28:21.439 --> 03:28:22.710 align:start position:0%
renumber from here and for that that
paragraph

03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
03:28:25.910 --> 03:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
he would also like to uh include in the
 
03:28:25.920 --> 03:28:28.150 align:start position:0%
he would also like to uh include in the
um

03:28:28.150 --> 03:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:29.910 --> 03:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
03:28:30.950 --> 03:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
i'll let you
 
03:28:33.510 --> 03:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and and i also want to charge the
 
03:28:36.550 --> 03:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner of dhhs on staying on top
 
03:28:37.590 --> 03:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:28:39.990 --> 03:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
eligible members once we get the health
 
03:28:43.910 --> 03:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
care facility definition uh hammered out
 
03:28:43.920 --> 03:28:45.269 align:start position:0%
care facility definition uh hammered out
and

03:28:45.269 --> 03:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:47.910 --> 03:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
have the commissioner know who's
 
03:28:50.790 --> 03:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
actively in the program and and if
 
03:28:52.790 --> 03:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
people are not or institutions are not
 
03:28:54.630 --> 03:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
actively involved
 
03:28:56.070 --> 03:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
that they would be
 
03:28:58.630 --> 03:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
indicated as not being active
 
03:29:02.790 --> 03:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh later i suggest in the bill that
 
03:29:05.190 --> 03:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
they create a website where all this
 
03:29:07.990 --> 03:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
stuff is very transparent
 
03:29:10.710 --> 03:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
so that there's an opportunity for the
 
03:29:13.110 --> 03:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
public to know who's participating and
 
03:29:15.510 --> 03:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
who is not and therefore they can put
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
their own bottoms up pressure on the
 
03:29:17.520 --> 03:29:19.590 align:start position:0%
their own bottoms up pressure on the
system

03:29:19.590 --> 03:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:29:19.600 --> 03:29:21.590 align:start position:0%
system
comment

03:29:21.590 --> 03:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:29:21.600 --> 03:29:23.110 align:start position:0%
comment
well

03:29:23.110 --> 03:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:29:25.590 --> 03:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
i find it very confusing
 
03:29:25.600 --> 03:29:27.750 align:start position:0%
i find it very confusing
to

03:29:27.750 --> 03:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:29:27.760 --> 03:29:28.710 align:start position:0%
to
on

03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:29:30.870 --> 03:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
one hand say
 
03:29:35.110 --> 03:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
that they may implement now that they
 
03:29:38.229 --> 03:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
keep in shall they shall implement and
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
then come over here and have opt out
 
03:29:42.710 --> 03:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
i mean maybe there's a different way of
 
03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
saying if
 
03:29:47.510 --> 03:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
a healthcare facility is not
 
03:29:48.630 --> 03:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
does not
 
03:29:50.550 --> 03:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
abide by this
 
03:29:52.790 --> 03:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
they have to do a report but it then
 
03:29:55.269 --> 03:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
opens up for me oh well maybe i can out
 
03:29:58.389 --> 03:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
there yeah so i agree with your point uh
 
03:30:00.389 --> 03:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
once it when we went from
 
03:30:01.830 --> 03:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
may to shall
 
03:30:04.150 --> 03:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
this shifted this paragraph
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
so i i would just see deleting most of
 
03:30:09.590 --> 03:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
the paragraph but what i would like to
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
see remain
 
03:30:14.710 --> 03:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
is the commissioner of the dhhs shall
 
03:30:17.670 --> 03:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
follow up so their participants status
 
03:30:20.070 --> 03:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
is at proactively known
 
03:30:21.229 --> 03:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
such the
 
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
participation status is properly
 
03:30:26.710 --> 03:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
reported in the annual report
 
03:30:29.269 --> 03:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
so so if there is somebody who's covered
 
03:30:31.990 --> 03:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
who's supposed to be covered by a show
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
but isn't coming to any meetings
 
03:30:37.269 --> 03:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
the commissioner would annotate that in
 
03:30:39.190 --> 03:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
the annual report that
 
03:30:42.630 --> 03:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
xyz hospital is supposed to be in the
 
03:30:45.030 --> 03:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
program but never came to a meeting
 
03:30:47.510 --> 03:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
never provided a report that that's what
 
03:30:49.590 --> 03:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to do there
 
03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
so you would take out the opt out i'd
 
03:30:53.670 --> 03:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
take the opt out out because it just
 
03:30:55.910 --> 03:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense
 
03:30:57.429 --> 03:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
once it becomes
 
03:30:57.439 --> 03:31:00.389 align:start position:0%
once it becomes
mandatory

03:31:00.389 --> 03:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:00.399 --> 03:31:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:31:07.590 --> 03:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
mr ripple
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
have i lost you because because i i
 
03:31:13.830 --> 03:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
could try harder no
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
i get it so that last sentence under
 
03:31:17.590 --> 03:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
renumber from here most of it would be
 
03:31:18.870 --> 03:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
out but the sentence that begins the
 
03:31:20.790 --> 03:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner of hhs that would stay in
 
03:31:20.800 --> 03:31:21.429 align:start position:0%
commissioner of hhs that would stay in
and

03:31:21.429 --> 03:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:23.110 --> 03:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know we might have to
 
03:31:25.429 --> 03:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
figure out where exactly in the in the
 
03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
rsa it would go but it would be in there
 
03:31:26.960 --> 03:31:27.990 align:start position:0%
rsa it would go but it would be in there
somewhere

03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:31:33.110 --> 03:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay so then the next one does another
 
03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:37.830 align:start position:0%
okay so then the next one does another
xiaomi

03:31:37.830 --> 03:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
xiaomi
 
03:31:37.840 --> 03:31:39.030 align:start position:0%
xiaomi
each

03:31:39.030 --> 03:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
each
 
03:31:40.630 --> 03:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
health facility
 
03:31:42.150 --> 03:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
may prepare
 
03:31:44.710 --> 03:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
and submit to the healthcare workplace
 
03:31:48.630 --> 03:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
safety commission an annual report
 
03:31:50.950 --> 03:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
so in talking to
 
03:31:53.349 --> 03:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
one of the lobbyists
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
it was suggested to me
 
03:31:56.640 --> 03:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
it was suggested to me
that

03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:31:59.590 --> 03:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
the report
 
03:32:02.469 --> 03:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
probably ought to be mandatory even if
 
03:32:03.670 --> 03:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
we made
 
03:32:03.680 --> 03:32:04.469 align:start position:0%
we made
the

03:32:04.469 --> 03:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
development of an internal program
 
03:32:06.960 --> 03:32:10.710 align:start position:0%
development of an internal program
optional

03:32:10.710 --> 03:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
and so if we were to honor that feedback
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
this should just not be changed at all
 
03:32:18.710 --> 03:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
it should just remain
 
03:32:22.309 --> 03:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:25.990 --> 03:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
moving on the chair of the joint hhs
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
oversight committee with the advice of
 
03:32:30.229 --> 03:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
the commission may recommend updates to
 
03:32:32.150 --> 03:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire statutes sort of the rule
 
03:32:34.710 --> 03:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
making process led by jail car
 
03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
basically what what was going on prior
 
03:32:38.229 --> 03:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
to this
 
03:32:40.630 --> 03:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
is that the commission was going direct
 
03:32:41.830 --> 03:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
to the com
 
03:32:44.070 --> 03:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me the commission
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
the workplace violence commission was
 
03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
going to the commissioner of dhhs
 
03:32:47.840 --> 03:32:49.110 align:start position:0%
going to the commissioner of dhhs
directly

03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
directly
 
03:32:50.550 --> 03:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
in saying
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner of dhhs
 
03:32:55.110 --> 03:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
was supposed to
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh with the advice and consent of the
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
members of the commission and i i don't
 
03:33:05.590 --> 03:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think we want to delegate
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
the uh executive branch action
 
03:33:12.630 --> 03:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
based on the consent of a commission
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
i i i think a smart commissioner would
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
listen to the commission and and
 
03:33:17.520 --> 03:33:18.389 align:start position:0%
listen to the commission and and
interpret

03:33:18.389 --> 03:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
interpret
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
it but
 
03:33:22.229 --> 03:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
the consent of the commission for the
 
03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner to act
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
should not be part of this
 
03:33:31.110 --> 03:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:34.870 --> 03:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay and so so how about the inclusion
 
03:33:37.030 --> 03:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the joint
 
03:33:40.070 --> 03:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
hhs oversight committee as as part of
 
03:33:46.630 --> 03:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:49.110 --> 03:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's a good place to land a
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
report on workplace violence
 
03:33:53.590 --> 03:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
and if there are laws that are needed
 
03:33:55.110 --> 03:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's the right place for people to
 
03:33:56.550 --> 03:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
consider whether or not there are new
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
i see you nodding
 
03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
it's good
 
03:34:04.239 --> 03:34:07.670 align:start position:0%
it's good
okay

03:34:07.670 --> 03:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:10.070 --> 03:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
all right so on the next page the third
 
03:34:12.710 --> 03:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
page i got into playing around when the
 
03:34:14.950 --> 03:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
annual report would be due
 
03:34:18.229 --> 03:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
and and this is just me sitting alone so
 
03:34:19.830 --> 03:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
if you have a different opinion share it
 
03:34:22.070 --> 03:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you my reasoning at the
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
time i thought having the annual report
 
03:34:26.790 --> 03:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
done at the end of december
 
03:34:30.469 --> 03:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
would be good because by the time
 
03:34:30.479 --> 03:34:31.429 align:start position:0%
would be good because by the time
um

03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
the budget process started we'd have a
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
current fresh copy of a report and so if
 
03:34:39.510 --> 03:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
there are any budget items
 
03:34:40.870 --> 03:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
addressed uh in the normal order
 
03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
but i don't really have a strong opinion
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
other than i do think that we should be
 
03:34:51.670 --> 03:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
more clear on when the annual report is
 
03:34:51.680 --> 03:34:53.830 align:start position:0%
more clear on when the annual report is
due

03:34:53.830 --> 03:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
due
 
03:34:57.830 --> 03:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:57.840 --> 03:34:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:34:58.790 --> 03:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
is this the annual report for each
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
facility or just one annual report from
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
the commissioner i i believe in this
 
03:35:06.950 --> 03:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
reference this is meant to be the
 
03:35:09.510 --> 03:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
commission on workplace violence their
 
03:35:11.910 --> 03:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
annual report and they would have to
 
03:35:14.630 --> 03:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
aggregate data from
 
03:35:16.950 --> 03:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
multiple institutions in order to do a
 
03:35:16.960 --> 03:35:18.550 align:start position:0%
multiple institutions in order to do a
roll-up

03:35:18.550 --> 03:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
roll-up
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
which is why i think i gave them some
 
03:35:23.590 --> 03:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
time to actually complete the report
 
03:35:26.070 --> 03:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
so let me suggest if the where you have
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
changed shell to may there in the second
 
03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:29.030 align:start position:0%
changed shell to may there in the second
line

03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:35:31.190 --> 03:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
that if you do that what i'm afraid of
 
03:35:32.070 --> 03:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
is that there will not be
 
03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
standardization among facilities
 
03:35:38.070 --> 03:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
so i i'll give up on the shell we can it
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
can be a shot i just think
 
03:35:41.590 --> 03:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
i i i don't believe that it
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
standardization wouldn't work
 
03:35:46.469 --> 03:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
without it but i'm okay okay so let's
 
03:35:47.750 --> 03:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
change that back to shell if you don't
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
mind except representing your verb has
 
03:35:53.990 --> 03:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
got an idea i can see okay okay
 
03:35:55.110 --> 03:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead representation i just want to
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
point out that this is not the end
 
03:35:56.399 --> 03:35:57.190 align:start position:0%
point out that this is not the end
report

03:35:57.190 --> 03:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:35:58.710 --> 03:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
this is one that's produced by each of
 
03:36:00.389 --> 03:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
the healthcare facilities number four
 
03:36:01.830 --> 03:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
which is what this references back to
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
says each health facility shall prepare
 
03:36:05.030 --> 03:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
and submit to the healthcare workplace
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
safety blah blah blah so this is talking
 
03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
about what that annual report is and i
 
03:36:10.870 --> 03:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
don't disagree that it shouldn't be a
 
03:36:12.389 --> 03:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
date certain you might want to actually
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
say that for the calendar year ending
 
03:36:17.269 --> 03:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
december 31st must be prepared by
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
january 15th or january 30th or
 
03:36:20.950 --> 03:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
something so you have the whole full
 
03:36:22.790 --> 03:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
year to work with four years worth of
 
03:36:24.150 --> 03:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
data and then the report comes out in
 
03:36:24.160 --> 03:36:25.670 align:start position:0%
data and then the report comes out in
january

03:36:25.670 --> 03:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
january
 
03:36:27.110 --> 03:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
just a thought
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know i don't see it but i i recall
 
03:36:33.030 --> 03:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere that i did set a date for when
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
the report was supposed to be due
 
03:36:38.950 --> 03:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but i but i may be wrong i was
 
03:36:41.750 --> 03:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
getting punched happy yesterday
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
so um okay so the next item
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
the incident including environmental and
 
03:36:49.349 --> 03:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
patient-specific risk factors present at
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
the time of the incident and then i
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
added as well as the appropriate
 
03:36:56.229 --> 03:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
categorization of the incident as
 
03:36:59.429 --> 03:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
workplace violence and or hostile words
 
03:37:01.590 --> 03:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
the reason i inserted that is because i
 
03:37:04.630 --> 03:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
want these reports to be meaningful
 
03:37:07.190 --> 03:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to have a definition
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
where we're aggregating data into a
 
03:37:13.030 --> 03:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
category so large that there's no way to
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
really interpret the data so i'm
 
03:37:17.229 --> 03:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there should be
 
03:37:22.309 --> 03:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:26.070 --> 03:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
any comment on that any opposition
 
03:37:26.080 --> 03:37:27.110 align:start position:0%
any comment on that any opposition
okay

03:37:27.110 --> 03:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:37:29.190 --> 03:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
next next down we're talking about
 
03:37:29.200 --> 03:37:31.030 align:start position:0%
next next down we're talking about
classifications

03:37:31.030 --> 03:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
classifications
 
03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:32.070 align:start position:0%
classifications
um

03:37:32.070 --> 03:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:32.080 --> 03:37:33.110 align:start position:0%
um
i

03:37:33.110 --> 03:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:37:34.550 --> 03:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
i i
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
i inserted but not any identifiable
 
03:37:39.510 --> 03:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
personal information
 
03:37:42.309 --> 03:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
because up above it had included the
 
03:37:44.469 --> 03:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
possibility of or actually the
 
03:37:47.110 --> 03:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
requirement that the names and job
 
03:37:49.349 --> 03:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
titles of employees involved in the
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
incident i i want this stripped of
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
personal data
 
03:37:56.309 --> 03:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
and about the only exception i would uh
 
03:37:59.110 --> 03:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
include would be if there's a police
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
report that gets attached because a
 
03:38:03.510 --> 03:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
police report is you know public
 
03:38:03.520 --> 03:38:04.790 align:start position:0%
police report is you know public
information

03:38:04.790 --> 03:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:38:06.790 --> 03:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
and then i left somewhere in here i
 
03:38:09.269 --> 03:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
talked about other governmental entity
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
official documents
 
03:38:13.510 --> 03:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know in case i overlook something
 
03:38:15.429 --> 03:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
with the police report
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
is there any comment about
 
03:38:19.990 --> 03:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
making sure these reports are
 
03:38:23.670 --> 03:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
devoid of personal data
 
03:38:23.680 --> 03:38:25.750 align:start position:0%
devoid of personal data
no

03:38:25.750 --> 03:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman i just
 
03:38:29.429 --> 03:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
i agree with everything you're saying
 
03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
except i don't see in here where police
 
03:38:33.429 --> 03:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
reports are included that's all
 
03:38:36.550 --> 03:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
i i i i'm hoping to portend a future
 
03:38:39.510 --> 03:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
event because i i do believe
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's in here somewhere but we'll we'll
 
03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:42.870 align:start position:0%
it's in here somewhere but we'll we'll
see

03:38:42.870 --> 03:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
um okay so i'm dropping down the little
 
03:38:45.840 --> 03:38:47.189 align:start position:0%
um okay so i'm dropping down the little
g

03:38:47.189 --> 03:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
g
 
03:38:47.199 --> 03:38:49.670 align:start position:0%
g
um

03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
so the percentage of employees that have
 
03:38:54.229 --> 03:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
participated in the workplace violence
 
03:38:54.239 --> 03:38:55.349 align:start position:0%
participated in the workplace violence
program

03:38:55.349 --> 03:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:38:58.630 --> 03:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
okay so this was left ambiguous so
 
03:39:00.950 --> 03:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
somebody could interpret it and say
 
03:39:03.510 --> 03:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
every time i'm to include a percentage
 
03:39:06.550 --> 03:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
of employees i need to calculate the
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
most recent 12 months
 
03:39:11.469 --> 03:39:11.479 align:start position:0%
and rather than having to do a constant
 
03:39:13.590 --> 03:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
recalculation every time they're looking
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
at this i'm saying that they should uh
 
03:39:18.870 --> 03:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
use the the
 
03:39:18.880 --> 03:39:20.550 align:start position:0%
use the the
the

03:39:20.550 --> 03:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
kind of a fixed percentage for
 
03:39:26.229 --> 03:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
their participation in the training and
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
the like
 
03:39:30.389 --> 03:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
do you have a comment on that
 
03:39:33.110 --> 03:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
03:39:33.120 --> 03:39:34.150 align:start position:0%
representative walner
no

03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:39:34.160 --> 03:39:38.630 align:start position:0%
no
okay

03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:41.670 --> 03:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
how about you sean
 
03:39:43.269 --> 03:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
are you do you have a copy of this are
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.359 --> 03:39:48.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:39:48.309 --> 03:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
so this is just clarity and and and
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
having to share
 
03:39:54.630 --> 03:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
the data instead of having to
 
03:39:56.630 --> 03:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
recalculate the data all the time i'm
 
03:39:58.950 --> 03:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
saying just use a point in time from the
 
03:39:58.960 --> 03:40:04.070 align:start position:0%
saying just use a point in time from the
report

03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:05.830 --> 03:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
well come on to the mic because you're
 
03:40:14.229 --> 03:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:16.150 --> 03:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair sean thomas
 
03:40:17.590 --> 03:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
from demers and praise representing the
 
03:40:20.389 --> 03:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire nurses association
 
03:40:22.229 --> 03:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
so with respect to this
 
03:40:24.389 --> 03:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
to g
 
03:40:26.550 --> 03:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
the idea here is this number would only
 
03:40:28.710 --> 03:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
be calculated once and be included in
 
03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
this annual report from the facility to
 
03:40:32.950 --> 03:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
03:40:35.429 --> 03:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
and so would be
 
03:40:37.750 --> 03:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
the percentage with respect to the
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
entire year
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
so you know if 95 of employees say had
 
03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
completed this training the number then
 
03:40:45.510 --> 03:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
would be 95 percent
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't it's not per incident it
 
03:40:48.630 --> 03:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be recalculated each
 
03:40:50.469 --> 03:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
incident it's just per report which is
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
once per year okay and that may not be
 
03:40:54.469 --> 03:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
clear i think i think i tried to write
 
03:40:56.389 --> 03:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
it that way if anyone doesn't think
 
03:40:59.269 --> 03:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's written well that that the mr
 
03:41:01.189 --> 03:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
thomas just explained what i was trying
 
03:41:02.630 --> 03:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
to get at
 
03:41:04.150 --> 03:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative i think what
 
03:41:05.349 --> 03:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
he's saying is remember recall this is
 
03:41:07.429 --> 03:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
an annual report so it's only being done
 
03:41:07.439 --> 03:41:08.469 align:start position:0%
an annual report so it's only being done
once

03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
once
 
03:41:10.870 --> 03:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
i know but what what
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
they also were talking about incidences
 
03:41:15.510 --> 03:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:41:17.429 --> 03:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
every time and you can have an inci you
 
03:41:19.830 --> 03:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
could have 12 incidences once a month
 
03:41:21.990 --> 03:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
and so this was just to just clarify
 
03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
that when there's an incident
 
03:41:25.510 --> 03:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
you're not having to calculate the
 
03:41:27.429 --> 03:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
percentage of the prior 12 months you're
 
03:41:30.229 --> 03:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to go use the
 
03:41:32.309 --> 03:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's what i was trying to
 
03:41:32.319 --> 03:41:33.910 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's what i was trying to
do

03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:41:37.590 --> 03:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh mr or representative weiler yes sir
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
i predicted a minority of the people
 
03:41:43.590 --> 03:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
eligible to file reports
 
03:41:45.990 --> 03:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
will file the majority of the reports
 
03:41:48.469 --> 03:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
and it be no way from this
 
03:41:50.950 --> 03:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
way this is written to tell
 
03:41:53.590 --> 03:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
that that was the case right is that a
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
good thing or a bad thing well
 
03:41:58.710 --> 03:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
i think as an employer you'd want to
 
03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
know if there's some that have very
 
03:42:02.469 --> 03:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
thin-skinned and see everything as an
 
03:42:05.510 --> 03:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
attack while others are
 
03:42:09.429 --> 03:42:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
i see what your point is
 
03:42:12.399 --> 03:42:13.670 align:start position:0%
i see what your point is
uh

03:42:13.670 --> 03:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:42:15.830 --> 03:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
but because we have a non-retaliation
 
03:42:18.550 --> 03:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
clause in this later it may make it
 
03:42:21.030 --> 03:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
better for the employer to not know
 
03:42:23.349 --> 03:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
from these reports who's
 
03:42:25.830 --> 03:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
creating the incident reports you know
 
03:42:28.389 --> 03:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
the lack of knowledge could be a defense
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
if somebody claims retaliation but
 
03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's just a thought that's brainstorming
 
03:42:34.319 --> 03:42:35.349 align:start position:0%
it's just a thought that's brainstorming
um

03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:38.150 --> 03:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
i the participation status of each
 
03:42:40.630 --> 03:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
health care facility eligible for active
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
cooperation in this workplace
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
program so this i think that's referring
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
to the annual report
 
03:42:50.309 --> 03:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know just a clear delineation by
 
03:42:53.990 --> 03:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
hospital name who is involved who's
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in this program and who's
 
03:42:58.550 --> 03:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
actively participating
 
03:42:58.560 --> 03:42:59.429 align:start position:0%
actively participating
um

03:42:59.429 --> 03:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
again the thought was a free market
 
03:43:04.950 --> 03:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
pressure campaign could be launched if
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's not participating
 
03:43:07.520 --> 03:43:08.309 align:start position:0%
somebody's not participating
there

03:43:08.309 --> 03:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:43:11.349 --> 03:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
jay there shall not be any identifiable
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
personal personal information recorded
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
in any report here it is representative
 
03:43:16.080 --> 03:43:16.950 align:start position:0%
in any report here it is representative
walls

03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
walls
 
03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
unless contained within an attached
 
03:43:21.590 --> 03:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
police report or other official report
 
03:43:24.790 --> 03:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
of a governmental entity violations may
 
03:43:26.950 --> 03:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
be adjudicated under the provisions of
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
the right to freedom of discrimination
 
03:43:30.630 --> 03:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
in the workplace i think that's the
 
03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.309 --> 03:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
um but because i think it representative
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
or mr ripple
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
that that's something you may want to
 
03:43:44.870 --> 03:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
highlight for uh ols i i think that's
 
03:43:47.189 --> 03:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
the right adjudication for
 
03:43:50.150 --> 03:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
but i could be wrong
 
03:43:53.110 --> 03:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
the next one uh seven roman numeral
 
03:43:55.510 --> 03:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
seven all persons within a health care
 
03:43:57.670 --> 03:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
facility are protected by the right to
 
03:43:59.670 --> 03:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
freedom of discrimination and public
 
03:44:02.550 --> 03:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
workplaces in education that's a true
 
03:44:05.189 --> 03:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
statement it's just adding clarity to
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
the rest of it
 
03:44:09.510 --> 03:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
um no person or health care facility
 
03:44:12.870 --> 03:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
shall retaliate in any manner against
 
03:44:15.590 --> 03:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
any reporting individual acting in good
 
03:44:15.600 --> 03:44:16.550 align:start position:0%
any reporting individual acting in good
faith

03:44:16.550 --> 03:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
faith
 
03:44:20.389 --> 03:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
mr thomas was earlier willing to accept
 
03:44:22.309 --> 03:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
the addition of the concept of good
 
03:44:22.319 --> 03:44:23.349 align:start position:0%
the addition of the concept of good
faith

03:44:23.349 --> 03:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
faith
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
so that an employee
 
03:44:28.309 --> 03:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't kind of weaponize
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
this reporting system
 
03:44:33.429 --> 03:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh just to you know create havoc
 
03:44:33.439 --> 03:44:34.229 align:start position:0%
uh just to you know create havoc
so

03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:36.150 --> 03:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
so this this just says as long as
 
03:44:38.070 --> 03:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
they're working in good faith they
 
03:44:39.910 --> 03:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
they're protected
 
03:44:43.110 --> 03:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:43.120 --> 03:44:44.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:44:44.550 --> 03:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:46.630 --> 03:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
dropping down
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner the department of
 
03:44:49.590 --> 03:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
health and human services shall be
 
03:44:52.070 --> 03:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintaining an easily
 
03:44:54.710 --> 03:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
navigable searchable distinct page on
 
03:44:56.710 --> 03:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
the department's website to share
 
03:44:58.630 --> 03:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
information on the activities of the new

hampshire healthcare workplace safety
 
03:45:00.560 --> 03:45:01.670 align:start position:0%
hampshire healthcare workplace safety
commission

03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:45:03.830 --> 03:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
topics to be included on the page shall
 
03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
include but not be limited to and then a
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
bunch of things but first is just the
 
03:45:11.510 --> 03:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
idea that this is an addition to the
 
03:45:14.309 --> 03:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
existing bill that we had
 
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
because i'm trying to create public
 
03:45:19.830 --> 03:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
pressure to participate and not just
 
03:45:20.710 --> 03:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:45:22.309 --> 03:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
a government
 
03:45:22.319 --> 03:45:23.670 align:start position:0%
a government
mandate

03:45:23.670 --> 03:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
03:45:25.670 --> 03:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
any issues with that do you want this on
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:31.990 --> 03:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
why not i hear
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
so what would they put on there they
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
would put a listing of all health care
 
03:45:38.710 --> 03:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
facilities by names with their business
 
03:45:41.429 --> 03:45:41.439 align:start position:0%
address included which are
 
03:45:43.830 --> 03:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
subject to the provisions of this
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
program that we're writing
 
03:45:48.550 --> 03:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
they would include the participation
 
03:45:51.830 --> 03:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
status of each facility as active
 
03:45:54.550 --> 03:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
opted out which no longer makes sense
 
03:45:55.990 --> 03:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
or unknown
 
03:45:58.870 --> 03:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh i i i don't know
 
03:46:00.870 --> 03:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
opted out probably should be replaced
 
03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
with something like inactive maybe
 
03:46:05.510 --> 03:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
if they're since we're getting rid of
 
03:46:06.870 --> 03:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
the opt out
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
do you see that mr ripple that too
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
very bottom of the page
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
very bottom of the page last night yes

03:46:21.030 --> 03:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
inactive
 
03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
change to inactive got it and if anyone
 
03:46:26.070 --> 03:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
has a better way of categorizing
 
03:46:28.710 --> 03:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
participation i'm i'm open that's just
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
can i say something what made sense
 
03:46:32.550 --> 03:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh representative irf and miss
 
03:46:34.950 --> 03:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
ripple note that the old section 7 got
 
03:46:36.150 --> 03:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
deleted that was the one that contained
 
03:46:38.150 --> 03:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
the fine information that that's where
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that's coming up here in a moment
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
um the meeting date the other thing that
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
they'll report on the website is the
 
03:46:50.950 --> 03:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
meeting dates of each meeting of the new
 
03:46:53.830 --> 03:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire health care workplace safety
 
03:46:53.840 --> 03:46:55.670 align:start position:0%
hampshire health care workplace safety
commission

03:46:55.670 --> 03:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:46:58.150 --> 03:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't mind if these were
 
03:47:00.790 --> 03:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
retroactive dates when the commission's
 
03:47:00.800 --> 03:47:02.550 align:start position:0%
retroactive dates when the commission's
met

03:47:02.550 --> 03:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
met
 
03:47:03.910 --> 03:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know that they need to be
 
03:47:05.550 --> 03:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
perspective because later in the
 
03:47:07.750 --> 03:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality part i don't think we're
 
03:47:09.429 --> 03:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
making this uh
 
03:47:11.590 --> 03:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
a public meeting so
 
03:47:14.309 --> 03:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
so posting dates in advance aren't is
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
aren't necessary
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh i would want them to hyperlink access
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
to each approved set of new hampshire
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
healthcare workplace safety commission
 
03:47:24.000 --> 03:47:24.950 align:start position:0%
healthcare workplace safety commission
minutes

03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:47:26.550 --> 03:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
if minutes of the meeting are not
 
03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
available the meeting date will be
 
03:47:30.150 --> 03:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
listed with the statement minutes
 
03:47:32.469 --> 03:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
unavailable so this raised a
 
03:47:32.479 --> 03:47:34.630 align:start position:0%
unavailable so this raised a
conversation

03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
03:47:34.640 --> 03:47:35.590 align:start position:0%
conversation
about

03:47:35.590 --> 03:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
if this is uh if these meetings are
 
03:47:40.710 --> 03:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
confidential confidential what would
 
03:47:42.389 --> 03:47:42.399 align:start position:0%
these minutes be doing
 
03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
i i think you could still write
 
03:47:46.870 --> 03:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
high-level minutes to inform the public
 
03:47:48.389 --> 03:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
of what's going on
 
03:47:50.630 --> 03:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
by saying here the here's the date we
 
03:47:50.640 --> 03:47:51.429 align:start position:0%
by saying here the here's the date we
met

03:47:51.429 --> 03:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
met
 
03:47:53.269 --> 03:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
here are the organizations that were
 
03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
present here are the organizations that
 
03:47:59.189 --> 03:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
were absent we talked about these issues
 
03:48:01.590 --> 03:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
and these are some of the things that we
 
03:48:04.630 --> 03:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
think should be considered by the
 
03:48:07.269 --> 03:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
commission in the future or
 
03:48:09.429 --> 03:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
by the state with new law
 
03:48:11.189 --> 03:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
so i think they can do high level
 
03:48:13.469 --> 03:48:13.479 align:start position:0%
minutes without violating the
 
03:48:15.910 --> 03:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
confidentiality we're giving them
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:20.640 --> 03:48:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:48:23.910 --> 03:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
so annually for the year ending in the
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
calendar year a press release shall be
 
03:48:28.469 --> 03:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
issued within 60 days highlighting the
 
03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
act of participation in health care
 
03:48:32.389 --> 03:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
facilities and any major findings or
 
03:48:32.399 --> 03:48:33.830 align:start position:0%
facilities and any major findings or
recommendations

03:48:33.830 --> 03:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
in the army they used to call these
 
03:48:36.239 --> 03:48:37.590 align:start position:0%
in the army they used to call these
attaboys

03:48:37.590 --> 03:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
attaboys
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to publicly acknowledge
 
03:48:43.189 --> 03:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
participation and give thanks
 
03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
i think i think they could be good press
 
03:48:47.110 --> 03:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
releases and again it's a source of
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
public pressure
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
okay so i removed
 
03:48:59.349 --> 03:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
all the next which had been in there
 
03:48:59.359 --> 03:49:00.870 align:start position:0%
all the next which had been in there
allowing

03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
discretion to the commissioner to of
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:10.950 --> 03:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
03:49:13.590 --> 03:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
removing the fines
 
03:49:15.510 --> 03:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
mr thomas do you have a comment on
 
03:49:30.150 --> 03:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.910 --> 03:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative we're okay with removing
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
the fines if that means uh the program
 
03:49:36.469 --> 03:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
remains mandatory
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
so so far have you heard anything that
 
03:49:40.790 --> 03:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
make you think that we're
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
not going to make this mandatory and i i
 
03:49:45.510 --> 03:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't mean all the 42 conversations i i
 
03:49:47.990 --> 03:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
mean the public hearing today no sir all
 
03:49:48.000 --> 03:49:49.269 align:start position:0%
mean the public hearing today no sir all
right

03:49:49.269 --> 03:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:49:50.790 --> 03:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:49:53.189 --> 03:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
you may as well sit there if you'd
 
03:49:53.199 --> 03:49:54.389 align:start position:0%
you may as well sit there if you'd
um

03:49:54.389 --> 03:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:55.910 --> 03:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
now that i can trust what you have to
 
03:49:55.920 --> 03:49:59.510 align:start position:0%
now that i can trust what you have to
say

03:49:59.510 --> 03:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:01.510 --> 03:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
03:50:03.750 --> 03:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative walner well we've got
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
mr thomas up here go ahead are there any
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
other pieces that we've just gone
 
03:50:08.880 --> 03:50:10.550 align:start position:0%
other pieces that we've just gone
through

03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
particularly i was wondering about all
 
03:50:12.479 --> 03:50:13.830 align:start position:0%
particularly i was wondering about all
this

03:50:13.830 --> 03:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
policy for the department of health and
 
03:50:20.950 --> 03:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:22.870 --> 03:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
it on the website and all of that is
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
there any parts of that that are
 
03:50:26.950 --> 03:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
concerning or are you
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
set with that
 
03:50:29.279 --> 03:50:31.990 align:start position:0%
set with that
uh

03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:33.750 --> 03:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
obviously i think primarily that's an
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
issue for the department i mean what i
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
would say specifically about that piece
 
03:50:40.630 --> 03:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh and representative edwards already
 
03:50:42.070 --> 03:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
commented on this
 
03:50:43.590 --> 03:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh i think specifically we were
 
03:50:45.510 --> 03:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
concerned with the meeting dates being
 
03:50:48.950 --> 03:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
included uh with these meetings being
 
03:50:51.429 --> 03:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
confidential and not public and why that
 
03:50:53.830 --> 03:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
would be necessary uh and then why the
 
03:50:55.510 --> 03:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
minutes would be included presumably the
 
03:50:57.349 --> 03:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
minutes two would be confidential but
 
03:50:59.590 --> 03:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know he he
 
03:51:02.150 --> 03:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
based on how he describes it i don't
 
03:51:03.990 --> 03:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
think those are those seem to be
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
non-issues at this point it's it's a
 
03:51:07.349 --> 03:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
question that question now whether or
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
not the department that's okay with the
 
03:51:10.710 --> 03:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
department and that's not for
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
for us to worry about but we're okay
 
03:51:15.269 --> 03:51:15.279 align:start position:0%
with it with that piece being in there
 
03:51:17.910 --> 03:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
ms minahan did you have to an opinion
 
03:51:26.469 --> 03:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:28.389 --> 03:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
sorry and i'm sorry i had to step out
 
03:51:30.550 --> 03:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
i'm starting i was running a zoom and
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:34.560 --> 03:51:38.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:51:38.309 --> 03:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:38.319 --> 03:51:39.349 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
i did talk with
 
03:51:41.279 --> 03:51:43.189 align:start position:0%
i did talk with
the

03:51:43.189 --> 03:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:51:45.910 --> 03:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
individual that runs our quality program
 
03:51:47.030 --> 03:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
at the
 
03:51:49.510 --> 03:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
foundation for healthy communities and
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
she's staff for the quality commission
 
03:51:54.790 --> 03:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
and she is very concerned about all of
 
03:51:57.670 --> 03:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
that being put on the website
 
03:52:01.670 --> 03:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
and because the entire process
 
03:52:03.910 --> 03:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the quality commission which this
 
03:52:07.030 --> 03:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
commission is mirrored after
 
03:52:07.040 --> 03:52:07.750 align:start position:0%
commission is mirrored after
and

03:52:07.750 --> 03:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:11.189 --> 03:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
we worked really carefully to mirror it
 
03:52:13.510 --> 03:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
we none of that should be
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
all of that is confidential and it
 
03:52:16.710 --> 03:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
should not be on the department's
 
03:52:16.720 --> 03:52:18.309 align:start position:0%
should not be on the department's
website

03:52:18.309 --> 03:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
website
 
03:52:20.389 --> 03:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
there will be no public
 
03:52:20.399 --> 03:52:21.429 align:start position:0%
there will be no public
minutes

03:52:21.429 --> 03:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:52:22.710 --> 03:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
03:52:25.110 --> 03:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite understanding where that
 
03:52:27.269 --> 03:52:27.279 align:start position:0%
came from and i apologize i didn't not
 
03:52:29.429 --> 03:52:29.439 align:start position:0%
hear that discussion point um
 
03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative edward so so i can tell
 
03:52:34.550 --> 03:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
you where it came from i i i invented it
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
because what i was attempting to do
 
03:52:38.670 --> 03:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
was to create
 
03:52:42.790 --> 03:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
a public awareness component of this
 
03:52:42.800 --> 03:52:43.830 align:start position:0%
a public awareness component of this
uh

03:52:43.830 --> 03:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:43.840 --> 03:52:45.030 align:start position:0%
uh
commission

03:52:45.030 --> 03:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:52:46.870 --> 03:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
so that staff
 
03:52:49.510 --> 03:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
patients community members
 
03:52:52.389 --> 03:52:52.399 align:start position:0%
could be informed of what's going on and
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
that they could uh
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
apply their own form of pressure to
 
03:52:56.640 --> 03:52:57.750 align:start position:0%
apply their own form of pressure to
encourage

03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh the participation of the
 
03:53:02.150 --> 03:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh entity
 
03:53:04.309 --> 03:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
so so uh
 
03:53:08.229 --> 03:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
so i i'm i'm okay with striking d on the
 
03:53:08.239 --> 03:53:10.150 align:start position:0%
so i i'm i'm okay with striking d on the
minutes

03:53:10.150 --> 03:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:53:12.790 --> 03:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
because that was just an idea to you
 
03:53:12.800 --> 03:53:13.830 align:start position:0%
because that was just an idea to you
know

03:53:13.830 --> 03:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:53:15.429 --> 03:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
if you want if you want the public to
 
03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
move you got to give them some
 
03:53:19.189 --> 03:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
information so this was my thought that
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
the commission could decide
 
03:53:24.469 --> 03:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
what it may want to include in the
 
03:53:24.479 --> 03:53:25.429 align:start position:0%
what it may want to include in the
minutes

03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:53:27.990 --> 03:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that they're
 
03:53:30.630 --> 03:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
a useful organization and that people
 
03:53:32.950 --> 03:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
should care about them
 
03:53:35.510 --> 03:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
it was a marketing piece
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification um
 
03:53:40.950 --> 03:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
there is an annual report um
 
03:53:43.990 --> 03:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
as like with the quality commission um
 
03:53:46.150 --> 03:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
so i don't believe that that is
 
03:53:49.269 --> 03:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
necessary i also am concerned about
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
adding the freedom from discrimination
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
in public workplace references
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding from reviewing that rsa
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
is that is for um
 
03:54:01.030 --> 03:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
that does not apply to private entities
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
so i don't and the hospitals already are
 
03:54:03.840 --> 03:54:05.189 align:start position:0%
so i don't and the hospitals already are
um

03:54:05.189 --> 03:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:06.750 --> 03:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
follow federal
 
03:54:09.030 --> 03:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination um so i don't i
 
03:54:11.110 --> 03:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
don't believe that that is actually
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
necessary i think that's a
 
03:54:14.870 --> 03:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation though
 
03:54:17.750 --> 03:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
rsa 354 is
 
03:54:20.309 --> 03:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
covers the state and it includes private
 
03:54:22.469 --> 03:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
entities okay that's not that was not my
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
reading i i cannot support putting that
 
03:54:26.550 --> 03:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
in there um i
 
03:54:29.429 --> 03:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
our position is the commission as
 
03:54:32.870 --> 03:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
drafted um we were we were supportive of
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
because again
 
03:54:36.469 --> 03:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
we worked really hard
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
on that entire drafting
 
03:54:42.150 --> 03:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
i also wasn't clear why the annual
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
report was being moved to the end of the
 
03:54:47.590 --> 03:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
year and i again i'm sorry i had to step
 
03:54:49.269 --> 03:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
out of the room i had to explain that
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
because um i wanted the report done
 
03:54:54.469 --> 03:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
freshly enough so it could be considered
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
in the budget process
 
03:55:03.910 --> 03:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.349 --> 03:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
um and again we we support mandatory um
 
03:55:10.710 --> 03:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
we don't support um voluntary
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
and i think we're gonna look do you
 
03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
understand that we're working so
 
03:55:17.590 --> 03:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
we're working from your original bill
 
03:55:18.870 --> 03:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
and we're taking pieces of this and
 
03:55:20.309 --> 03:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
putting it in the original bill so it is
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
still mandatory okay minus defines and
 
03:55:25.750 --> 03:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay some some of the some institutions
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
the the small urgent care facilities
 
03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
yeah you're here for that part of the
 
03:55:31.349 --> 03:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
conversation yes okay yeah i don't have
 
03:55:34.150 --> 03:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
an opinion on the urgent care centers um
 
03:55:37.510 --> 03:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
so i i appreciate um that if
 
03:55:39.510 --> 03:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
to take them out
 
03:55:39.520 --> 03:55:40.389 align:start position:0%
to take them out
they

03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
they may or may not want to participate
 
03:55:44.229 --> 03:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure um the hospital urgent care
 
03:55:47.910 --> 03:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:49.750 --> 03:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you were there any other
 
03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:55:53.460 --> 03:55:53.470 align:start position:0%
i had a question about the
 
03:55:53.470 --> 03:55:54.790 align:start position:0%
i had a question about the
[Music]

03:55:54.790 --> 03:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:55:58.150 --> 03:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
the calendar date of december 31st
 
03:55:58.160 --> 03:55:59.429 align:start position:0%
the calendar date of december 31st
you

03:55:59.429 --> 03:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:56:00.790 --> 03:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
so you didn't feel that was an
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate date
 
03:56:02.399 --> 03:56:03.189 align:start position:0%
appropriate date
or

03:56:03.189 --> 03:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:56:06.469 --> 03:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
was it necessary well the effective date
 
03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
is starts in july of 23 so i thought we
 
03:56:12.309 --> 03:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
were going to be following that that
 
03:56:15.030 --> 03:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal state fiscal year um
 
03:56:17.670 --> 03:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's why i thought i wasn't
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
understanding why it was going to to
 
03:56:19.680 --> 03:56:20.870 align:start position:0%
understanding why it was going to to
december

03:56:20.870 --> 03:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
december
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that's necessarily
 
03:56:25.830 --> 03:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
problematic except
 
03:56:28.070 --> 03:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
if it starts in july i was thinking do
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
we have a short first year of six months
 
03:56:30.720 --> 03:56:31.830 align:start position:0%
we have a short first year of six months
report

03:56:31.830 --> 03:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:56:33.910 --> 03:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
or do we have an 18 month that's why i
 
03:56:35.830 --> 03:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
was getting confused about that i didn't
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
understand i'd say yes and it's probably
 
03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
going to take you six months to get all
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
the carbon blown out of the cylinders to
 
03:56:45.910 --> 03:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:48.309 --> 03:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
03:56:49.510 --> 03:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:56:49.520 --> 03:56:50.950 align:start position:0%
okay so
uh

03:56:50.950 --> 03:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
the next one down
 
03:56:54.150 --> 03:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know i have no
 
03:56:54.160 --> 03:56:55.269 align:start position:0%
you know i have no
uh

03:56:55.269 --> 03:56:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
i don't really care about it i i the
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
members of the commission may ideally be
 
03:57:03.349 --> 03:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
composed instead of shao and i
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh i just i i just like if this is going
 
03:57:09.750 --> 03:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
to be a private entity
 
03:57:11.750 --> 03:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
that they have the flexibility to do a
 
03:57:14.389 --> 03:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
little self-government and if they
 
03:57:16.389 --> 03:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
had different members
 
03:57:16.399 --> 03:57:17.590 align:start position:0%
had different members
then

03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:57:19.670 --> 03:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's really not a state issue
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
but so i could see
 
03:57:26.710 --> 03:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:29.110 --> 03:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
then on duties down below
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
the duty of the commission shall propose
 
03:57:31.520 --> 03:57:32.710 align:start position:0%
the duty of the commission shall propose
changes

03:57:32.710 --> 03:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
and this just changes who they're uh
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
plugging into
 
03:57:39.030 --> 03:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
proposed changes to the joint
 
03:57:41.110 --> 03:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
legislative health and human services
 
03:57:44.389 --> 03:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
committee and the commissioner of dhhs
 
03:57:47.189 --> 03:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
so because the so that there's a direct
 
03:57:51.510 --> 03:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
legit legislative communication
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any
 
03:58:02.229 --> 03:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
the next one on the next page d probably
 
03:58:04.950 --> 03:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
should just be stricken since we don't
 
03:58:07.670 --> 03:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
we no longer have uh envisioned the
 
03:58:13.429 --> 03:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:13.439 --> 03:58:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
on

03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:58:18.630 --> 03:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh on the chair when they get elected
 
03:58:18.640 --> 03:58:19.670 align:start position:0%
uh on the chair when they get elected
uh

03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
my suggestion was to have the very
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
initial term of the chair be for three
 
03:58:26.870 --> 03:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
years instead of two years
 
03:58:31.189 --> 03:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
so that you get into a method where
 
03:58:33.670 --> 03:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
you're always overlapping an experienced
 
03:58:36.309 --> 03:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
vice chair with a brand new chair an
 
03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
experienced chair with a brand new vice
 
03:58:41.590 --> 03:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
chair so it's kind of a one-time deal
 
03:58:43.830 --> 03:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
to to have the chair serve for three
 
03:58:47.189 --> 03:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
years and not two but subsequently two
 
03:58:49.510 --> 03:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's what that's intended to do
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
any concerns
 
03:58:54.630 --> 03:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
anyone thinking that's a brilliant idea
 
03:58:57.429 --> 03:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
yeah yes yes that's brilliant thank you
 
03:58:59.830 --> 03:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to take that in testimony
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:59:03.110 --> 03:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
but seriously if anyone doesn't like
 
03:59:04.630 --> 03:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
that let me know
 
03:59:04.640 --> 03:59:06.309 align:start position:0%
that let me know
um

03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:08.070 --> 03:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
then in
 
03:59:08.080 --> 03:59:09.590 align:start position:0%
then in
education

03:59:09.590 --> 03:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:59:11.830 --> 03:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
the chair will be respond this is an
 
03:59:13.830 --> 03:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
addition the chair will be responsible
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
for ensuring information intended for
 
03:59:17.189 --> 03:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
the public
 
03:59:19.830 --> 03:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
is transmitted in appropriate format to
 
03:59:23.349 --> 03:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of dhhs or designee
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
and again the belief is that we want
 
03:59:28.870 --> 03:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
the public aware enough of what's going
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
on so that the staff and the public
 
03:59:34.870 --> 03:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
can let the hospital systems know that
 
03:59:39.429 --> 03:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:42.309 --> 03:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
and and that i deleted and i have to
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
think why but i deleted all such
 
03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
information shall be demons
 
03:59:47.359 --> 03:59:49.510 align:start position:0%
information shall be demons
disseminated

03:59:49.510 --> 03:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
disseminated
 
03:59:51.510 --> 03:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
through each participant's safety and
 
03:59:53.910 --> 03:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
security program well i i don't know
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
that if you if we're saying each
 
03:59:57.189 --> 03:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
participant is supposed to have a safety
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
security program or are we already
 
04:00:00.550 --> 04:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
getting too much into the internal
 
04:00:03.269 --> 04:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
affairs of and and operational structure
 
04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:00:07.030 --> 04:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
members i it just seems like that was
 
04:00:09.670 --> 04:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
too specific your comment there mr
 
04:00:09.680 --> 04:00:11.110 align:start position:0%
too specific your comment there mr
thomas

04:00:11.110 --> 04:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
thomas
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
what i would say to that is is that
 
04:00:14.870 --> 04:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
particular language is
 
04:00:17.110 --> 04:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
comes exactly out of the
 
04:00:19.670 --> 04:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh quality safety commission after which
 
04:00:21.429 --> 04:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
this commission is modeled so this is
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
already existing language and current
 
04:00:23.199 --> 04:00:25.510 align:start position:0%
already existing language and current
law

04:00:25.510 --> 04:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:27.670 --> 04:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's a process that is known and that
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
protects the confidentiality which is
 
04:00:31.030 --> 04:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
obviously of utmost importance in this
 
04:00:31.040 --> 04:00:31.990 align:start position:0%
obviously of utmost importance in this
case

04:00:31.990 --> 04:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
and then with respect to the piece you
 
04:00:36.389 --> 04:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
added the sentence you added above i
 
04:00:39.510 --> 04:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
would only just want to reference in
 
04:00:43.189 --> 04:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
down in section 7 151 j7
 
04:00:46.389 --> 04:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
i think this is already addressed
 
04:00:49.110 --> 04:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
where it says specifically
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
any information about processes or
 
04:00:52.630 --> 04:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
outcomes provided pursuant to this
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
section shall be aggregate data only and
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
shall not reference individual incidents
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
patients health care providers or
 
04:01:00.150 --> 04:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
institutions so i don't know that it's
 
04:01:02.229 --> 04:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
necessary in this particular location as
 
04:01:02.239 --> 04:01:03.189 align:start position:0%
necessary in this particular location as
well

04:01:03.189 --> 04:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
well the this is sort of got the
 
04:01:07.670 --> 04:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
opposite intent though this this is
 
04:01:09.910 --> 04:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
meant to have the chair
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
use the dhhs website
 
04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
as a way of being a beacon to the public
 
04:01:19.590 --> 04:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
about the program this this this is this
 
04:01:21.910 --> 04:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
is the opposite of confidentiality this
 
04:01:23.590 --> 04:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
is the chair
 
04:01:23.600 --> 04:01:24.870 align:start position:0%
is the chair
deciding

04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
deciding
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
how to use the website process to get
 
04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate attention on this program
 
04:01:32.880 --> 04:01:33.670 align:start position:0%
appropriate attention on this program
just

04:01:33.670 --> 04:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
so so just to get it out of here
 
04:01:38.309 --> 04:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
the strikethrough from all such
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
information through disgust i could see
 
04:01:44.150 --> 04:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
just putting it back in there then
 
04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
but do you do you still have a concern
 
04:01:49.110 --> 04:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
about the addition of the
 
04:01:54.389 --> 04:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:56.550 --> 04:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
um as i state
 
04:01:59.110 --> 04:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
i we do the hospital association again
 
04:02:01.510 --> 04:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
that is not the intent of the commission
 
04:02:03.590 --> 04:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's not how the quality commission is
 
04:02:06.870 --> 04:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
structured there is an annual report as
 
04:02:09.189 --> 04:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
stated and that is how um
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
this information is disseminated so we
 
04:02:15.030 --> 04:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
we are not um
 
04:02:16.870 --> 04:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure how that all would
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
work but um
 
04:02:20.710 --> 04:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
we respectfully um
 
04:02:22.070 --> 04:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
the reporting the annual reporting um
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
accomplishes the same thing
 
04:02:27.840 --> 04:02:31.189 align:start position:0%
accomplishes the same thing
right

04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:33.200 --> 04:02:33.210 align:start position:0%
is the whole annual report public
 
04:02:33.210 --> 04:02:34.469 align:start position:0%
is the whole annual report public
[Music]

04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:02:34.479 --> 04:02:36.870 align:start position:0%
[Music]
yes

04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.710 --> 04:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
so i thought this was such an important
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
topic with incidences like two
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
strangulations happening every month
 
04:02:45.630 --> 04:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
you know that that that there was more
 
04:02:48.229 --> 04:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
contemporaneous need for information
 
04:02:50.790 --> 04:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
sharing and public awareness
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
this this this was an attempt to help
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
highlight the importance of this
 
04:02:58.150 --> 04:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
commission you want to underplay that
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
um i
 
04:02:59.760 --> 04:03:00.469 align:start position:0%
um i
am

04:03:00.469 --> 04:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
am
 
04:03:00.479 --> 04:03:01.590 align:start position:0%
am
following

04:03:01.590 --> 04:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
following
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative edwards all the work of
 
04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
the study committee and the experts that
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
testified and this is the approach that
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
was agreed upon as i shared with you on
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
senate bill 100
 
04:03:15.110 --> 04:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
study committee report
 
04:03:15.120 --> 04:03:16.150 align:start position:0%
study committee report
so

04:03:16.150 --> 04:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:16.160 --> 04:03:17.349 align:start position:0%
so
again

04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:03:20.550 --> 04:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
the quality commission has had 17 years
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
of success and
 
04:03:26.070 --> 04:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
that structure is what we uh
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
respectfully want to follow um so
 
04:03:31.990 --> 04:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
mr ripple uh just keep 151 j4 education
 
04:03:39.030 --> 04:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
the same no changes
 
04:03:40.870 --> 04:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
no changes to
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
your proposal no to the way the bill
 
04:03:46.070 --> 04:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
um and then in confidentiality all
 
04:03:51.189 --> 04:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
information other than public facing
 
04:03:53.910 --> 04:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
minutes or police reports
 
04:03:56.150 --> 04:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
so it does allow that there may be a
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
police report
 
04:04:10.389 --> 04:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:13.670 --> 04:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
i would need to check with um folks i'll
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
need to check on that
 
04:04:20.550 --> 04:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh so down on three
 
04:04:23.590 --> 04:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh in addition um
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh this is about the
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
incidents where individuals are involved
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the principles of data
 
04:04:33.189 --> 04:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
minimization will be respected to
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
include de-identification of any
 
04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
04:04:41.110 --> 04:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
so far we've said that that's
 
04:04:43.269 --> 04:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
the intent anyway so
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh and the under administration uh added
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
the phrase and data privacy to make the
 
04:04:51.750 --> 04:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
sentence the final sentence on the page
 
04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
read the activities of the department of
 
04:04:55.030 --> 04:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
health and human services and its
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
employees or agents shall be subject to
 
04:05:00.150 --> 04:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
the same confidentiality provisions and
 
04:05:03.030 --> 04:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
data privacy as those that apply to the
 
04:05:03.040 --> 04:05:06.710 align:start position:0%
data privacy as those that apply to the
commission

04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:09.750 --> 04:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
going on to the last page uh that's just
 
04:05:11.590 --> 04:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
an issue again with the
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
when is the report due
 
04:05:18.070 --> 04:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
the go ahead
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
you might want to move that into january
 
04:05:22.150 --> 04:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
so they can capture all of the year's
 
04:05:22.160 --> 04:05:25.030 align:start position:0%
so they can capture all of the year's
data

04:05:25.030 --> 04:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:26.389 --> 04:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
is this the annual report you're talking
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
about yeah i don't i like i said i just
 
04:05:32.469 --> 04:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh threw a dart at that and my goal in
 
04:05:34.469 --> 04:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
the big picture was just to have a fresh
 
04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
report for the budget process so maybe
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
that report is coming out
 
04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
you know january
 
04:05:41.199 --> 04:05:43.750 align:start position:0%
you know january
31.

04:05:43.750 --> 04:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
31.
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
can you change that january 31 as of
 
04:05:49.189 --> 04:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
december 31st
 
04:05:49.199 --> 04:05:51.429 align:start position:0%
december 31st
okay

04:05:51.429 --> 04:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:05:51.439 --> 04:05:52.790 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
then the such report
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
may describe the activities of the
 
04:05:57.840 --> 04:06:00.790 align:start position:0%
may describe the activities of the
commission

04:06:00.790 --> 04:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.030 --> 04:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to be able to say
 
04:06:05.189 --> 04:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
that we would indicate the institution's
 
04:06:07.349 --> 04:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
participation or their lack of
 
04:06:09.510 --> 04:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
participation if they weren't
 
04:06:09.520 --> 04:06:11.110 align:start position:0%
participation if they weren't
participating

04:06:11.110 --> 04:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
participating
 
04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
so um so let's change that may
 
04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
there in the middle of that paragraph
 
04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
to shall
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to keep the lack of
 
04:06:20.960 --> 04:06:22.469 align:start position:0%
i'd like to keep the lack of
participation

04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
participation
 
04:06:24.630 --> 04:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
listed as well
 
04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
you have a problem with highlighting
 
04:06:27.680 --> 04:06:29.269 align:start position:0%
you have a problem with highlighting
institutions

04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
that don't participate who are supposed
 
04:06:31.359 --> 04:06:33.830 align:start position:0%
that don't participate who are supposed
to

04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
i mean that's the point of making this
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:41.590 --> 04:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
right so i don't know that it's
 
04:06:43.429 --> 04:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
necessary okay
 
04:06:47.110 --> 04:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
so then at the bottom of that paragraph
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh any information about processes or
 
04:06:51.990 --> 04:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes provided pursuant to this
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
section shall be aggregate data only
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
shall not reference individual incidents
 
04:06:59.510 --> 04:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
and then it closes with other than to
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
identify the health care facilities oh
 
04:07:03.510 --> 04:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
drop that
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
that whole black part there can be
 
04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:14.150 --> 04:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
on rulemaking i deleted the phrase and
 
04:07:16.630 --> 04:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
consent of a majority of the members
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
because the executive branch of the
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
state government doesn't rely on the
 
04:07:25.269 --> 04:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
consent of a commission it establishes
 
04:07:25.279 --> 04:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
consent of a commission it establishes
so

04:07:26.150 --> 04:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
a smart commissioner will listen to the
 
04:07:31.590 --> 04:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
advice and then do the right thing
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
you have an issue with that
 
04:07:35.590 --> 04:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
does anyone have an issue with those
 
04:07:35.600 --> 04:07:36.389 align:start position:0%
does anyone have an issue with those
things

04:07:36.389 --> 04:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:07:39.429 --> 04:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
so so so i i think we've gone through
 
04:07:39.439 --> 04:07:40.229 align:start position:0%
so so so i i think we've gone through
this

04:07:40.229 --> 04:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:07:42.630 --> 04:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
mr ripple i think we've given you
 
04:07:46.229 --> 04:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
enough comments for an amendment to this
 
04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh oh good point nice catch there's one
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
last one
 
04:07:53.269 --> 04:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
on the effective date uh i said it shall
 
04:07:55.229 --> 04:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
be repealed march 1st
 
04:07:59.349 --> 04:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
2024 34 excuse me 34.
 
04:08:01.510 --> 04:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
um and that's just that'll give it 10
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
years and people can relook it
 
04:08:05.349 --> 04:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
i just wondered if we had did we come to
 
04:08:11.269 --> 04:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
a decision around
 
04:08:13.590 --> 04:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
taking out state facilities or was that
 
04:08:13.600 --> 04:08:14.790 align:start position:0%
taking out state facilities or was that
left

04:08:14.790 --> 04:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
left
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
i i think we came to that
 
04:08:19.110 --> 04:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
i assumed we came to that decision but
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
we can come back and clarify it i i in
 
04:08:22.319 --> 04:08:23.189 align:start position:0%
we can come back and clarify it i i in
order

04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
order
 
04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
the whole reason finance is looking at
 
04:08:27.110 --> 04:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
it is because it's costing fte per
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
hospital for the state and i just assume
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
have the state voluntarily participate
 
04:08:32.239 --> 04:08:33.189 align:start position:0%
have the state voluntarily participate
without

04:08:33.189 --> 04:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
it becoming mandatory for the state
 
04:08:38.229 --> 04:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say the state can't
 
04:08:38.239 --> 04:08:40.229 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say the state can't
participate

04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
participate
 
04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to know whether we had how
 
04:08:45.510 --> 04:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
we had come down on that one so i we i i
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
think we said that the state could be
 
04:08:50.870 --> 04:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
excluded from the health facilities but
 
04:08:56.229 --> 04:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
well i hope that they will volunteer i
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
do i mean i think that we could
 
04:09:02.389 --> 04:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
take them out
 
04:09:03.990 --> 04:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
at this point i mean basically we're
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
i don't even know if glencliff really
 
04:09:09.990 --> 04:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
qualifies because it's a nursing home
 
04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that nursing homes are
 
04:09:15.670 --> 04:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
covered here are they let's ask the lba
 
04:09:15.680 --> 04:09:16.630 align:start position:0%
covered here are they let's ask the lba
rep

04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
rep
 
04:09:18.550 --> 04:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
because this came from lba language
 
04:09:20.229 --> 04:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
right they're not
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
nursing homes are not part of this bill
 
04:09:25.110 --> 04:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
you're correct representative walner i'm
 
04:09:27.110 --> 04:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
not sure um
 
04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
glenn cliff is a long-term care facility
 
04:09:31.510 --> 04:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
so you're right i i don't know how that
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
got in there honestly i had nothing to
 
04:09:36.149 --> 04:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
do with the fiscal note okay
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
04:09:41.189 --> 04:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
i had asked mr ripple for an answer so
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
let's just give him a chance to respond
 
04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
i think you're right i think glencliff
 
04:09:48.950 --> 04:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire hospital this bill
 
04:09:50.790 --> 04:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
likely would not apply to them even as
 
04:09:53.110 --> 04:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
written that information was suggested
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
to me today so the fiscal note may have
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
been an error in that respect uh going
 
04:10:01.830 --> 04:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
and hampstead also wouldn't probably
 
04:10:04.319 --> 04:10:05.269 align:start position:0%
and hampstead also wouldn't probably
uh

04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:07.750 --> 04:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
be required to uh i'm not sure i haven't
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
had any conversations about that one
 
04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
you think it makes sense to
 
04:10:14.389 --> 04:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
leave some wording there that lets it be
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
well it was new hampshire hospital new
 
04:10:17.670 --> 04:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital would have qualified
 
04:10:17.680 --> 04:10:19.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital would have qualified
right

04:10:19.110 --> 04:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:10:20.550 --> 04:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire hospital would have been
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:27.110 --> 04:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
it depends on how they are licensed if
 
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:35.110 --> 04:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
but to like you said to um they have a
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
probably the most robust program
 
04:10:37.840 --> 04:10:39.189 align:start position:0%
probably the most robust program
already

04:10:39.189 --> 04:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
and hospitals have utilized their
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
training programs they're it's called
 
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
what's it called pam knows what it's
 
04:10:50.149 --> 04:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
called i'm secure it's an acronym
 
04:10:52.469 --> 04:10:52.479 align:start position:0%
so they have had a program for a long
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
time and they do report on all sorts of
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
um incidences so um i don't obviously
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
speak for new hampshire hospital but um
 
04:11:02.000 --> 04:11:02.950 align:start position:0%
speak for new hampshire hospital but um
they

04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
i i again i miss the conversation are
 
04:11:05.680 --> 04:11:06.550 align:start position:0%
i i again i miss the conversation are
you

04:11:06.550 --> 04:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:11:08.550 --> 04:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
contemplating putting it in as an
 
04:11:11.429 --> 04:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
optional is that what you're thinking
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
state facilities optional just make it
 
04:11:15.990 --> 04:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
and then hampstead could be
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
takes the state cost out
 
04:11:18.960 --> 04:11:21.830 align:start position:0%
takes the state cost out
okay

04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay mr chairman
 
04:11:23.600 --> 04:11:24.389 align:start position:0%
okay mr chairman
uh

04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
representative walls thank you
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering if we can add a
 
04:11:30.870 --> 04:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
provision in there that if a state
 
04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
facility is run by a private corporation
 
04:11:37.110 --> 04:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
in other words if they contract
 
04:11:40.870 --> 04:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
hampstead out do we have one now
 
04:11:42.389 --> 04:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
no but they're talking there's there's
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
before the executive council
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
can we deal with that when it's real
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
it is real i'm telling you that they're
 
04:11:50.710 --> 04:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
talking about doing it within the next
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
month to make hampstead run by a private
 
04:11:55.750 --> 04:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
facility it's very real right now
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
do we know how they'd be licensed
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:05.110 --> 04:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
ms minihan doesn't know i don't know
 
04:12:06.630 --> 04:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
i i'm afraid i don't know i would just
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
point out they're probably whether i
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
would qualify they're not run by a
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
private facility the ceo the cefo all
 
04:12:14.950 --> 04:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
those folks they're new hampshire dhhs
 
04:12:17.429 --> 04:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
employees it's below that the con that
 
04:12:19.189 --> 04:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
the contract picks up so i imagine they
 
04:12:20.870 --> 04:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
would still qualify as a state facility
 
04:12:23.910 --> 04:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's true the leadership i had not
 
04:12:25.990 --> 04:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
seen the contract but i was informed of
 
04:12:27.750 --> 04:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
it today and that raised the concern for
 
04:12:28.630 --> 04:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
me that
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to wait on an amendment
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
because i think we changed enough stuff
 
04:12:38.550 --> 04:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
that we just need to see it
 
04:12:40.870 --> 04:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and then i would like to get
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
to 275 and i'd like to finish 275 today
 
04:12:46.149 --> 04:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
because it's the only day it's on our
 
04:12:48.469 --> 04:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
agenda is your question
 
04:12:50.950 --> 04:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
important in this moment it is it's i
 
04:12:52.469 --> 04:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
have one more question
 
04:12:54.710 --> 04:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
in the version of this bill that we are
 
04:12:56.550 --> 04:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
turning out is your definition of
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
hostile words still included
 
04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay is my definition of what hostile
 
04:13:03.910 --> 04:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
words and representatives said yes well
 
04:13:06.389 --> 04:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
to that end well that's he answered for
 
04:13:09.429 --> 04:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
me but but my answer is it's included in
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
the draft that's going to go to ols and
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
they can look at the language and if
 
04:13:15.269 --> 04:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
they think there's some smart lawyer way
 
04:13:17.510 --> 04:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
to describe the distinction between
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
workplace violence and hostile words i
 
04:13:23.189 --> 04:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
i'm open to the smart lawyers
 
04:13:24.550 --> 04:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
well let me just say i was doing a
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
little googling when we were here and uh
 
04:13:28.149 --> 04:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
let me suggest the smart lawyers look at
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
the definition of harassment and
 
04:13:31.510 --> 04:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
criminal threatening because i think
 
04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
it's similar particularly harassment to
 
04:13:35.189 --> 04:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do and i just want
 
04:13:36.630 --> 04:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're not creating
 
04:13:38.790 --> 04:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
definitions that conflict with those
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
definitions that are currently in the
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
rsas that's all i was going to suggest i
 
04:13:42.800 --> 04:13:43.670 align:start position:0%
rsas that's all i was going to suggest i
agreed

04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative irf did you have a
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
question i was just a suggestion asked
 
04:13:49.990 --> 04:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
ripple about 275 because i believe he
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
indicated that since you recessed it you
 
04:13:54.630 --> 04:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
could pick it up again tomorrow
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
that is true and also um
 
04:14:00.149 --> 04:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
your revised amendment to 275 is
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
currently in the works at ols so i think
 
04:14:03.110 --> 04:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
that probably won't be ready until
 
04:14:09.510 --> 04:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:12.389 --> 04:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
we can talk about 275 tomorrow
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
and we're not violating any paul smith
 
04:14:14.560 --> 04:14:15.750 align:start position:0%
and we're not violating any paul smith
rules

04:14:15.750 --> 04:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:14:18.550 --> 04:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so all right mr edwards
 
04:14:20.149 --> 04:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
could i
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
i see john williams is here in the room
 
04:14:25.830 --> 04:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
yes and also uh representative leon the
 
04:14:27.269 --> 04:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
vice chair of
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh hhs who who did uh 459. so would you
 
04:14:33.910 --> 04:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
like to hear from mr williams or do you
 
04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
want to ask him a question there's just
 
04:14:38.070 --> 04:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
one specific area i wanted to hear from
 
04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
come on up there wasn't anyone in the
 
04:14:43.510 --> 04:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
room when we got down to
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
on page two of your or page three of
 
04:14:48.710 --> 04:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
your amendment
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
when we got down to
 
04:14:52.790 --> 04:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
a discussion draft
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
when you we got down to roman numeral
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
eight the commissioner of health and
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
human services shall be responsible
 
04:14:59.279 --> 04:15:00.229 align:start position:0%
human services shall be responsible
for

04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
basically maintaining a website
 
04:15:04.710 --> 04:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have anybody here from
 
04:15:06.550 --> 04:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
health and human services to talk to us
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
about whether that was because this is
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
all new
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
whether that was possible impossible
 
04:15:17.590 --> 04:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
would add cost i mean what's
 
04:15:19.429 --> 04:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
what does this all mean
 
04:15:19.439 --> 04:15:20.389 align:start position:0%
what does this all mean
what

04:15:20.389 --> 04:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
sega in the page
 
04:15:23.990 --> 04:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
well i think it's page three your your
 
04:15:26.149 --> 04:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
draft isn't um
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
the number there are any numbers
 
04:15:29.910 --> 04:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's right at the bottom
 
04:15:32.070 --> 04:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
of page three
 
04:15:34.950 --> 04:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay i see it so basically mr williams
 
04:15:37.510 --> 04:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
this is just saying uh to give this
 
04:15:37.520 --> 04:15:38.790 align:start position:0%
this is just saying uh to give this
commission

04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:15:40.389 --> 04:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
a public face
 
04:15:42.070 --> 04:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
so that public
 
04:15:44.550 --> 04:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
interest and public energy and public
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
pressure could be applied if
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals are not participating that
 
04:15:52.950 --> 04:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
that the dhhs
 
04:15:56.309 --> 04:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
would use their website web
 
04:15:57.500 --> 04:15:57.510 align:start position:0%
site to
 
04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:58.870 align:start position:0%
site to
[Music]

04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
host a page
 
04:16:03.349 --> 04:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
basically dedicated to this commission
 
04:16:05.510 --> 04:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then it would meet the standards of
 
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
any website that it should be searchable
 
04:16:10.870 --> 04:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
um you know the like do you want to do
 
04:16:12.229 --> 04:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
you want to comment on that that because
 
04:16:16.950 --> 04:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
for the record john williams the
 
04:16:21.349 --> 04:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
director for relative affairs with the
 
04:16:23.110 --> 04:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of health and
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
services and i just on a very high level
 
04:16:27.990 --> 04:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
just want to say that our is in support
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
of this very important initiative i
 
04:16:29.520 --> 04:16:30.389 align:start position:0%
of this very important initiative i
believe

04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:16:33.030 --> 04:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
rev edwards there was not only a
 
04:16:35.429 --> 04:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
commentary that you had seen from the
 
04:16:36.790 --> 04:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
health human services oversight
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
committee on friday but this is
 
04:16:40.389 --> 04:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
something certainly our agency
 
04:16:43.510 --> 04:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
would fulfill our obligations around the
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
legislation uh it's also acknowledged
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
that because of the effective date being
 
04:16:51.429 --> 04:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
um july 1st of 2023 unless in your your
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
amendment i apologize if it's changed a
 
04:16:53.600 --> 04:16:55.110 align:start position:0%
amendment i apologize if it's changed a
date

04:16:55.110 --> 04:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
date
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
if that's the occasion then the costs
 
04:16:59.110 --> 04:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
associated with this and i would agree
 
04:17:00.630 --> 04:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh with mr ripple that we need to
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
provide you with a updated digital
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
worksheet at least as it relates to new
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and glencliff home
 
04:17:08.149 --> 04:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
which glenn cliff home clearly uh being
 
04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
a long-term care facility wouldn't fall
 
04:17:11.910 --> 04:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
under this but we could build in
 
04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
whatever costs associated with the bill
 
04:17:17.030 --> 04:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh through the budget process in the
 
04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
24-25 budget so the agency does support
 
04:17:22.309 --> 04:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
whatever iteration that you work out on
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
this bill um we do also want to point
 
04:17:28.229 --> 04:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
out that the bill as uh it came to this
 
04:17:28.239 --> 04:17:29.269 align:start position:0%
out that the bill as uh it came to this
committee

04:17:29.269 --> 04:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
still had components to it that would
 
04:17:33.030 --> 04:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
have some fiscal implications to the
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
department uh one would be the
 
04:17:37.750 --> 04:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the fines as it came to
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
your committee in the other piece and
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's out of here and i like that very
 
04:17:44.229 --> 04:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
very good for the audience um and the
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
other uh piece of it would be even
 
04:17:47.590 --> 04:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
though it doesn't use the words
 
04:17:49.030 --> 04:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
04:17:50.790 --> 04:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
department in many fashions the
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
commission the way the language is
 
04:17:54.070 --> 04:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
drafted we would have to provide some
 
04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
level of support but again i say all of
 
04:17:57.750 --> 04:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
that with we would
 
04:17:58.950 --> 04:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively with the
 
04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
legislature to build into the budget to
 
04:18:02.550 --> 04:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
accommodate for that based on the
 
04:18:08.309 --> 04:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:09.990 --> 04:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
so after hearing you
 
04:18:12.630 --> 04:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
go through all of that then you are fine
 
04:18:15.349 --> 04:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
with the department um
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
maintaining a website
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
that was my specific part about that i
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to know whether you were okay
 
04:18:24.309 --> 04:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:18:24.319 --> 04:18:24.950 align:start position:0%
with that
and

04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:26.550 --> 04:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
represent edwards i i hope that the
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
background i did provide was helpful but
 
04:18:29.990 --> 04:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes i did not directly answer
 
04:18:32.790 --> 04:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative walner's question and as
 
04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
we have worked collaboratively with the
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
legislature in the past posting on the
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
department website seems not to be
 
04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
anything onerous at all and in fact i
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
think consistent with our goals of
 
04:18:43.830 --> 04:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
promoting this particular initiative
 
04:18:47.590 --> 04:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr williams uh
 
04:18:52.550 --> 04:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
chair vice chair leon
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
have you have you heard enough of the
 
04:18:56.790 --> 04:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
discussion on 459 or if you could give
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
us some some words on whether you think
 
04:19:02.070 --> 04:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh what we've done here is consistent
 
04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
with the direction if not the
 
04:19:04.239 --> 04:19:05.670 align:start position:0%
with the direction if not the
literal

04:19:05.670 --> 04:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
literal
 
04:19:11.910 --> 04:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and i did
 
04:19:14.950 --> 04:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
arrive just as you were beginning the
 
04:19:16.710 --> 04:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
discussion so i was able to catch most
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
of it
 
04:19:19.429 --> 04:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
it looks like this has been a nice
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
attempt to sort of soften those edges
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
and get it more towards something that
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
will address the goals without
 
04:19:27.349 --> 04:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
that big fine issue
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
anything that's in the licensing statute
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
we heard is something that if somebody
 
04:19:32.790 --> 04:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
jeopard somebody does not follow it
 
04:19:34.630 --> 04:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes their license
 
04:19:37.110 --> 04:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
so i feel that there's already a lot of
 
04:19:38.790 --> 04:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
heft behind anything that you're doing
 
04:19:41.429 --> 04:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
here in this section that's actually why
 
04:19:42.790 --> 04:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
in the senate they move the patient's
 
04:19:44.790 --> 04:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
bill of rights out of the licensing
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
statute and put it in the patient's bill
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
of rights section so that it doesn't
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
have the same heft and weight that it
 
04:19:52.550 --> 04:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
would in licensing
 
04:19:54.149 --> 04:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
with that having it
 
04:19:55.349 --> 04:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
as a may
 
04:19:57.510 --> 04:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
for or having it as a shell for anybody
 
04:20:00.070 --> 04:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
that is more than three urgent cares
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
does provide a good carve out now i am
 
04:20:03.590 --> 04:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
concerned that that's going to lock in
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
those small facilities
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
as being one or two location only and
 
04:20:10.469 --> 04:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
inhibit their potential growth because
 
04:20:12.309 --> 04:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
if a new hampshire facility would need
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
one full-time employee to implement this
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
i can only imagine that an urgent care
 
04:20:18.790 --> 04:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
would also need one full-time employee
 
04:20:21.030 --> 04:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
so i remain concerned about the shell
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
because of those those small urgent
 
04:20:22.800 --> 04:20:23.990 align:start position:0%
because of those those small urgent
cares

04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
cares
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
but i do agree that this is a very
 
04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
important program um i i do have
 
04:20:31.269 --> 04:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
questions though as to
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
if the strangulations happening at
 
04:20:34.469 --> 04:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
dartmouth are already in violation of
 
04:20:34.479 --> 04:20:35.590 align:start position:0%
dartmouth are already in violation of
law

04:20:35.590 --> 04:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:20:38.149 --> 04:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
and if they are how adding this is going
 
04:20:40.229 --> 04:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
to do anything to make them safer if
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
those if those people that have
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
strangled people at dartmouth hitchcock
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
are not being prosecuted maybe there's a
 
04:20:47.110 --> 04:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
bigger problem that we need to address
 
04:20:48.710 --> 04:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:20:50.950 --> 04:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
so i guess those are my takeaways i
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
think you guys are doing great work
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
um i probably might assume that was
 
04:20:55.279 --> 04:20:58.389 align:start position:0%
um i probably might assume that was
rhetorical

04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:59.830 --> 04:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
if you want i was going to say to my
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge the prosecutor the question is
 
04:21:03.429 --> 04:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
what kind of security is they happen in
 
04:21:05.110 --> 04:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
the er what kind of
 
04:21:06.630 --> 04:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
what kind of security is in the er to
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
prevent them from happening that was the
 
04:21:08.560 --> 04:21:09.750 align:start position:0%
prevent them from happening that was the
question

04:21:09.750 --> 04:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:21:09.760 --> 04:21:10.870 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:21:10.870 --> 04:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's a really good facility choice
 
04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
when i was down at boston medical center
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
when i broke my femur some of the people
 
04:21:17.750 --> 04:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
that came in with gunshot wounds from
 
04:21:19.590 --> 04:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
gang warfare were guarded there because
 
04:21:21.030 --> 04:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
that was something they needed to do to
 
04:21:22.630 --> 04:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
keep their patients safe
 
04:21:25.110 --> 04:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
i hope we don't end up with lockdown ers
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
like you do down at boston medical
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
center but if that is part of providing
 
04:21:31.830 --> 04:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
safe care that's part of that duty of
 
04:21:33.510 --> 04:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
care whether it's written to this law or
 
04:21:33.520 --> 04:21:34.550 align:start position:0%
care whether it's written to this law or
not

04:21:34.550 --> 04:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:21:36.389 --> 04:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
you know the way i recall it is uh
 
04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
because i used to work with um hospital
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
architects on re-engineering for image
 
04:21:43.030 --> 04:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
management networks and so i had a
 
04:21:45.269 --> 04:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
chance to work through a lot of this and
 
04:21:47.910 --> 04:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
i i think there's like a jcho
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
architectural standard of things that
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
they should consider or contemplate in
 
04:21:55.110 --> 04:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
the design of their new facilities and i
 
04:21:59.189 --> 04:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
i am i think the security next to the er
 
04:22:03.990 --> 04:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
has has been a big thing for decades
 
04:22:05.429 --> 04:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
i know when i started working in
 
04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
hospitals in 1970 they had the security
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
right next to the er so
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead if i may that actually brings
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
up another big question
 
04:22:18.309 --> 04:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
when reading through this it says that
 
04:22:20.070 --> 04:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
if you're already
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
under the join accreditation commission
 
04:22:23.670 --> 04:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
you still follow that
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if dartmouth follows that
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
but as an institution of their size and
 
04:22:28.229 --> 04:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
heft i would assume that they're jayco
 
04:22:28.239 --> 04:22:29.429 align:start position:0%
heft i would assume that they're jayco
certified

04:22:29.429 --> 04:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
certified
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
so if they're already following a
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
program that allows them to opt out of
 
04:22:34.630 --> 04:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
this program i'm not sure how that would
 
04:22:37.269 --> 04:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
provide any more safety to
 
04:22:38.309 --> 04:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
to this
 
04:22:39.670 --> 04:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
i can't believe they were strangled
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
there but i don't know how this would
 
04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
provide any more safety because those
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
sort of things should never happen but i
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
don't think this would fix it for them
