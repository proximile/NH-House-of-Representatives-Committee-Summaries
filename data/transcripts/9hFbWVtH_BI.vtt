00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
$2,500 this bill would increase the
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%

injury or death of a person or
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
persons that's part one of what my bill
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
does increase the current maximum
 
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:start position:0%

30
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
days now on this point this is where the
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
house Commerce
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
Committee did a tremendous amount of
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
amending and so in the amended version
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
that you had that passed the house
 
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
unanimously and the Commerce Committee
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
following if a licen person in charge
 
00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
managers security staff service and
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
months before the date of the
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
violation then the first offense cannot
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
exceed 15 days
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
suspension the second offense within
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
years of the second offense results in
 
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.070 align:start position:0%
years of the second offense results in
license

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
revocation now I'm going to go off
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
script a bit and give you my thought on
 
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.990 align:start position:0%
script a bit and give you my thought on
that

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it was also the cause of
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
tremendous discussion in the house
 
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.350 align:start position:0%
tremendous discussion in the house
Commerce

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
Commerce
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
Committee in this
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
state training for bartenders servers
 
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
not the Liquor Commission offers
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
training and it's open and it's online
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
and you and I could take
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
it so the conversation that took place
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
in house commerce was well you know the
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
debate was well do we have mandatory
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
training don't we what do we do in this
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
and that so the idea was to incentivize
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
establishments to have have their
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
employees take the Liquor Commission
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
training there wouldn't be just an
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
automatic uh 30day of suspension and so
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
forth there's obviously a tier system to
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
that so the narrative here is that it
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
mandate that training but it
 
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.430 align:start position:0%
mandate that training but it
incentivizes

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
it item three of what this bill
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
does the bill requires public
 
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
notification stating the reason for the
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
suspension I believe the croak family
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
will mention what happened in their
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
instance to The Establishment and how it
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
was not publicized their closing and in
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
their instance their establishment
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
closed over the holidays and it just
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
simply said happy holidays we wish our
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
employees and our
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
patrons a very merry
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
Christmas no mention of why they were
 
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.750 align:start position:0%
Christmas no mention of why they were
closing

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
closing
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
down this bill if an establishment is
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
having their license suspended would
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
then be required to publish why in this
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
language liquor license suspended by the
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Liquor Commission for over
 
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
serving of alcohol in accordance with
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
RSA 179 colon 5 a reason for why their
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
doors are shut for whatever amount of
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
time their license is suspended
 
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
which is determined by The Liquor
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
Commission Governor sonunu as I
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself I can say that was
 
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
one of the best presented bills we've
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
seen so far this year so thank you for
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
the time and effort you put into it um
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
couple questions for me
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
why not mandatory
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
training excellent question and that is
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
a long time debate now with me today is
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative kahill who is a
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor to this bill he has worked
 
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.029 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor to this bill he has worked
for

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
years on mandatory training I he could
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
probably give you the best historical
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
and institutional knowledge analysis of
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
that uh because he's I would consider
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
him the resident expert on why it hasn't
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
happened thank you um also the the
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
suspension days um for over serving in
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
in my opinion seem a little light um
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
what was the reasoning behind that if
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
you could um was there a lot of push
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
back to making it stiffer did anyone
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
think about it and talk about it so just
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
to clarify a a number higher than 30
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
yeah well uh higher than 15 for certain
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
and and it seems to take a while before
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
revoked yes that uh 15 date just was
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
tied into the whole incentive to train
 
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
but I don't recall any specifics as to
 
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
um why the numbers were chosen that they
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
were okay thank you further questions
 
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:17.799 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative
 
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
jandrin thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
uh representative for taking my
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
question I noted on the bill that we
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
received in committee here um under the
 
00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.350 align:start position:0%
received in committee here um under the
fiscal

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
note that it says ex existing commission
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
rules provide for a fine of 2500 10day
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
suspension for the first offense $5,000
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
fine and suspension for 30 to 60 days
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
for the second offense but in the bill
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
as it was amended um I'm looking at line
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
12 that for a second offense it would be
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
a 15-day and a maximum of 30-day
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't seem it seems to me based
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
upon the fiscal note and what the bill
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
says is that we're actually Li
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
lightening the suspension for the second
 
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
that thank you I don't know if I have
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
the same physical not as you just to
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
clarify but I believe by what you said
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
um you may be right in that
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
interpretation because that's part of
 
00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039 align:start position:0%
the incentive to taking the training so
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
if you've taken the training uh then yes
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
quote unquote lighter than if you did
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
not have your employees take that
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
training follow up thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you again for the allowing the
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
followup um it would seem to me that b
 
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
this line B there's no mention of the
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
training it's only mentioned in a that's
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
the lighter the lighter suspension for
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh the first offense has nothing in the
 
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
second offense even denoting that so
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
that's why I was wondering why it was
 
00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
providing a lighter suspension and not
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
training I see that could be um a matter
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
of um reading you know maybe clarified
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
it could be more perhaps I'd be
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
interested in what the Liquor Commission
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
thinks of that very topic uh how easy it
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
is for them to interpret it since
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
they're the ones enforcing it uh based
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
on if they've taken the training or not
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
so uh I know the Liquor Commission is
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
represented here today and hopefully
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
they can pick up on that when they
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
testify thank you
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
um one quick question for me it it seems
 
00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:41.799 align:start position:0%
to me that I understand the
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
incentivizing part but if someone's had
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
the training and they they overs serve
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
it seems they should be punished harsher
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
than someone who hasn't had the trainy
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
because they should know better would
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
you agree with that that that is a very
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
interesting interpretation and I had not
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
thought of that and that's not come up
 
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
but that is that's interesting I I would
 
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
have to think about that more because
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's the first I've heard that but
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative sik
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm hiding behind the
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
microphone from you um so my I I very
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
much support the concept of the bill my
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
question is I I remember from you know a
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
hundred years ago when I went to bars
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
that frequently friends would go to buy
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
around for the table for example and so
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
the person who was driving may never
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
actually be the person who went up to
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
the bar and be visibly drunk to the
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
people selling and providing the alcohol
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering how
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
like how that plays into this right
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
because in terms of the process and and
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't have the answer to that
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
but it just I think about when the
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
person is just at the table and their
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
friends are providing it from the bar to
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
them representative before you answer I
 
00:27:58.029 --> 00:27:58.039 align:start position:0%
would just I would assum assume that the
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is going to testify
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
how their investigations are conducted
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
um because that would come down to an
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
investigation but if you have an answer
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
please B all means thank you very much
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that question and that
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
is a very good point and I'm glad you
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
said that because that came up pretty
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
frequently in Commerce people were very
 
00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:17.519 align:start position:0%
fascinated by the process and wanted to
 
00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
sort of uh mesh that into this but this
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
is solely about penalties not about
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
process and I'll say The Liquor
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
Commission I know they'll talk more
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
about it when they get to this table but
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
they have a process that seems uh locked
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
tight in fact in the case of the croak
 
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
family which they may mention they had
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
down to the ounce of what this
 
00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
individual drank so in an instance like
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
that uh because the process seems to be
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
working effectively I think the Liquor
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
Commission would get to the bottom of it
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
very quick but this is a bill about
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
penalties with regards to an over served
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
intoxicated person who causes a bodily
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
harm or a death thank
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
for your hey
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
what go ahead represent Stone thank you
 
00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:11.799 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and real quickly uh can you
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
explain why we haven't increased the uh
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
fine amount for the subsequent
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
offense I'm sorry why we haven't yeah
 
00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
it's the same amount as the uh primary
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
or first offense I I would say that is a
 
00:29:25.149 --> 00:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
decision made by the Commerce Committee
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
that wasn't in my original version uh
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
certainly something that could be
 
00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
explanation good now thank you for your
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very
 
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:40.840 align:start position:0%

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
working on this issue for a very long
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
time uh full disclosure I I drink
 
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol uh I may have a beer or a glass
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
of wine with dinner depending on what it
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
is and the weather uh I may have two
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
drinks if I'm at a wedding and
 
00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
celebratory but not much beyond that and
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
I we've been working on this issue
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
because what what got my what got my
 
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
attention was a number of years ago a
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant in the community not far from
 
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
where I live uh was involved in over
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
serving it was clear-cut over serving of
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
three young men one of them underage
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
they looked at his uh ski pass and I
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
guess that was his ID but of course he
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
was underage and they served these kids
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
I'll say kids they were like I think
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
maybe 21 or 22 the oldest they served
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
these kids a couple of Dr drinks like
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
with multiple kinds of alcohol in them
 
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
and there was no doubt that there was
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
over serving uh not long after they left
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
the restaurant uh they went off the road
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
and I believe they hit a tree and the uh
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
attorney representing the restaurant you
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
know disclosed that yes there was empty
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
beer cans in the in the vehicle and so
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
how do we know who was responsible I
 
00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
know those beer cans were from another
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
occasion where they're just driving
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
around and I know that kids drive around
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
with beer cans cuz I do I do a roadside
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
Cleanup in my town and I see it I see
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
the the beer cans the uh the little
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
little um nips that they sell at the
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
liquor store I I see all this and I pick
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
them up so I know people are driving
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
around drinking and that's not the fault
 
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
of the uh lenses but the lenses are
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
responsible for what they serve and
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
nowadays we can see on the tab how much
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
was served how much and over what period
 
00:31:59.789 --> 00:31:59.799 align:start position:0%
of time so it's clear to me that over
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
serving is
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
happening so I I'm glad this bill is
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
happening I support the bill I don't
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
think it goes quite far enough I I did
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
try to have a mandate and the training
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
is uh about 30 minutes and I I passed it
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
without any study it's free which we
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
like in New Hampshire and yet the
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
industry was was resistant because they
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
didn't want to mandate and they said
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
well you know the people were not really
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
responsible because they PR game you
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
know because you know they'll have a
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
couple beer or two before they go to the
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
restaurant and I know that people are
 
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
bar hopping so you don't know how long
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
how much where they've been and what
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
they've had before they come into your
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
restaurant but you're supposed to take a
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
good look at them and see if they appear
 
00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
to be and you know drunk and not serve
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
them additional
 
00:32:48.159 --> 00:32:49.750 align:start position:0%
them additional
alcohol

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
um I had an experience uh at I think at
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
the prior election where I was out there
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
front of the polls and one of the people
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
standing next to me happened to be an
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
attorney specializing in DUI and you
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
know he represents his client and he he
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
he we T talked about this issue and he
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
said that you'll never you'll never put
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
an end to this long as long as there's a
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
greater incentive to serve and you know
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
it the uh the owner of the establishment
 
00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
makes money the server makes money the
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
state makes money we're all making money
 
00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately sometimes The
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
Undertakers make money so it it's a
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
complicated issue uh the industry is is
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
very resistant very powerful in this
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
state and they're not you know they
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
don't do all the serving the people just
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
have a house party they go drinking and
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's out of hand and we have this
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
culture uh of of excessive alcohol I
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
think we are we in one other state drink
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
like the most alcohol per
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
capita and uh I'll give another example
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
there's a restaurant I'm fond of um and
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
they never had any problems because
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
that's not the kind of place people go
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
to drink they have a nice meal they
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
might have a cocktail and a glass of
 
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
wine great uh the place was sold and I
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
went there with you know with the new
 
00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
owner and uh I sat we sat at the barart
 
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
the place was packed and we happened to
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
know the
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
bartender and the owner comes out and we
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
compliment him on you know the recipes
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
are still good you know that's a good
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
marinara sauce you know and he says to
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
the bartender this this group in the
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
back they want shots and the bartender
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
says we don't have shot glasses because
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
we don't do that well use these other
 
00:34:33.629 --> 00:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
glasses so we're going to have people
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
doing shots and of course that's peer
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
pressure you know let's do another round
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
and before you know it you shouldn't be
 
00:34:43.629 --> 00:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
driving so I'm concerned about this I'm
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
glad we're taking some steps toward
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
addressing it uh I wish we would do more
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
and you know I also want to say that you
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
you see in the bill that all these
 
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
penalties it's up to so we know that
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
that can be less than the maximum again
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
I I wish it was more automatic but
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a very hard thing to
 
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
get through the Commerce Committee and
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
and you know it has to go through both
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
bodies and the industry as I said
 
00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
well-meaning people but they're
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
protecting their
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
interests and had we done something
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
sooner uh other lives may have been
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
saved I know there was a tragedy in
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
Conway where a person was obviously
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
drunk drove into the library not to take
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
out book but he crashed and he killed
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
his passenger and that was before the
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunate loss of the croak family and
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
before the uh fellow driving around the
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
uh Circle in Portsmith didn't make it
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
all around he he flipped over a few
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
times and the young lady
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
died it's a serious problem and I'm glad
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing something but I wish we go
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
further uh that concludes my
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%

00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
um my only concern would be the training
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
portion of it um in Elizabeth's case Cas
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
if they had training and this you know
 
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.829 align:start position:0%
if they had training and this you know
still

00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
happened it's almost like a free pass to
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
me I just think
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
that um we need to send a clear message
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
that this type of behavior is not
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
acceptable and that bars and restaurants
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
need to be be held accountable for their
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
actions I mean there's been other CA
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
there was a case in nashille recently
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
where a motorcycle was hit with a driver
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
and a passenger that was killed and it
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
was reported that the driver that truck
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
had multiple um who sered multiple
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
drinks so it's it's it's a problem that
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
has to be addressed thank you um and I
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
speak for the committee when I say we're
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
sorry for your loss thank you for
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
Summers

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Mike
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
Summers I'm the president CEO of the New
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
Association and uh we are here in
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
um I need to give some some reference
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
here and and I I can appreciate the
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
emotion of of the moment but the thing
 
00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
that uh concerns us for the industry is
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
that you have to understand how the
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry works we are a cash
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
flow business and we are not opposed to
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
an increase in the penalty of to some
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
degree Our concern is that this is a
 
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
300% uh increase in the penalty from
 
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
from 10 days to to 30 days I also want
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
to point out that this this part of the
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
statute this is just administrative
 
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
penalty this doesn't really affect what
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
can be brought against the business and
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
the individual via civil and criminal
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
penalties which are significantly more
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
onerous than than this administr uh this
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh action could take but I think what I
 
00:46:30.549 --> 00:46:30.559 align:start position:0%
what I want to try to convey to you is
 
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
the concern from the smallest businesses
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
that if they were to be handed a 30-day
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
suspension of license the business is
 
00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
essentially out of business and so that
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
means loss of business the employees are
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
unemployed whole variety of things that
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
Cascade from there and you know I I also
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we understand
 
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
that whilst we are talking about the
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
very worst cases in the industry these
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
are a rarity in the industry uh the
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
majority of our of businesses in this
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
industry they work very hard at making
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
sure that there is no over service that
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
people underage are not served um a lot
 
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
of time effort and resources goes into
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
those training programs so we just ask
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
you to appreciate the fact that you know
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
let's not
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
um vilify the an industry that certainly
 
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
this is a risky uh space to be in but we
 
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
just feel that a 300% increase in the
 
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
penalty is is a bit Draconian um and
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
over the
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
top the other thing that concerns us is
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
you know yes uh there are are horrible
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
instances where this over service has
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
happened but we also find ourselves in
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
an age where we do have pregaming people
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
come in they just pounded whatever in
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
the parking lot um you know they we
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
serve them one maybe two drinks and
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
they're then visibly intoxicated right
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
and then so things can spir out of
 
00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
control very very quickly we've had
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
instances where folks are you know they
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh have a couple of drinks at a resta
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
restaurant the dinner whatever it might
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
be then they take a a medication as
 
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
they're leaving whatever it might be and
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
again kids are experimenting with all
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of crazy things right now and so
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
now it be puts us in a situation where
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
you know it can come back to be a
 
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
penalty on the business and the business
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
legitimately had tried to do the right
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
thing so I I I I I think we just asked
 
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
that we uh we take a look at um what is
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
a reasonable
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
um a reasonable adjustment and the last
 
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
thing response uh representative kill
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
had repes referenced that you know our
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
per capita uh per capita alcohol
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
consumption in the state of New
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the highest in the country
 
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
that is a misleading number and I ask
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
you to recognize that uh I think believe
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
even the Liquor Commission will testify
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
that 50% of alcohol sales in the state
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire are made to out ofate
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
residents who are taking it with them
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
that is a significant number and a sign
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
and it skews the numbers heavily to
 
00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:51.559 align:start position:0%
looking like we drink an awful lot and
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
we really don't drink that much um so I
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
I think I think at that point I'll leave
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
it there and uh and I'd certainly be
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer any
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
um what is the industry's reason for
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
push back on mandating the training it's
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
free it's only 30 minutes um um I'm
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
interested to hear
 
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:15.799 align:start position:0%
that because as as an organization we
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
try to testify or to support uh policies
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
that uh give greater Flex greatest
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
flexibility to our our business members
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
and that require the the least number of
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
thresholds and Reporting requirements
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
that can get us in a gotcha where it's a
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
penalty of fee Etc because once you get
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
into a license to serve which is what
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
you're essentially talking about here
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
there is now an administrative function
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
on the be on behalf of uh liquor
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement to track all of this
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
information I guarantee there will be a
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that the business has to
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
track all of this and along with all the
 
00:49:47.789 --> 00:49:47.799 align:start position:0%
other things that we have to have in an
 
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
employees file it's just one more thing
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
that essentially becomes a gotcha if you
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
forgot to put it in there or or
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
something along those lines
 
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
further questions representative n thank
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
question um I'm wondering if you have
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
any numbers based on the uh restaurants
 
00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
that you represent um how many actually
 
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:11.799 align:start position:0%
do the training without it being
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
mandated I would actually defer to
 
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement that's not data we
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
would be able to collect necessarily but
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
I I think that they do keep a re a
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
pretty good record of of that the one
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
one follow on comment to that is you
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
know in in the way this training
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
component was added by house Commerce
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
we're actually okay with that clearly it
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
looks like there should be some clean up
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
in the language but we like the
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
incentive program right I think that
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
makes sense that incentivizes people to
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
do the training I think from a business
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
insurance perspective that would
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
actually improve their insurance rating
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
with carriers Etc so we're actually
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that and we like that
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
commer added it to the to the Bill thank
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
you represent Murray thank you Mr chair
 
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
I'm actually a bartender downtown in
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I can say I have never
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
received any kind of training on you
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
know a serving liquor and didn't even
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
know that that training was available
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
for free on the New Hampshire Liquor
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
State commission website um I'm just
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
curious you know if you feel like the
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
penalties are too high would not the um
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh compromise be mandating this training
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
I think businesses already have to
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
maintain you know records on their
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
employees and you know all these
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
different aspects and I think adding one
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
more thing to the list makes sense when
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
the cost is so high frankly I don't know
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
that it ever became a discussion on this
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
bill specifically when this was in house
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
Commerce you know there were been prior
 
00:51:46.789 --> 00:51:46.799 align:start position:0%
bills Etc so I think we're open to a
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
discussion I think where we get
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
concerned is what does it look like
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
right how was the language written what
 
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
are the requirements what are the
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
penalties attached and those kinds of
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
things and and I will also say we don't
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
represent every single restaurant or
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
hotel in the state of New Hampshire we
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
have about 1300 members but that's out
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
of I I think you know six or 7,000
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
lenses in the state of New Hampshire so
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
again I I speak specifically for our
 
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
membership who I like to think are the
 
00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.390 align:start position:0%
membership who I like to think are the
best

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
operators see no further questions thank
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%

00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
Licensing um just uh as I'm sitting in
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
the back of the room um I think a lot of
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know from me being being here back
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
six seven years ago when I was a State
 
00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
Trooper for 28 years and what we have
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
done in recent years to to fix some of
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
the efficiencies and effectiveness of
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission that was the
 
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
reason or of the division that was the
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
reason for me coming over um one of the
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
things that we have seen and I have
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
learned um is that uh the division is
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
there to to um educate and create a
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
foundation of
 
00:53:33.789 --> 00:53:33.799 align:start position:0%
compliance and that is through our
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
education platform it really is
 
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
compliance the success of the division
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
is through the compliance of our
 
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
licenses the the points that every one
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
of you are bringing up are very valid
 
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
points I appreciate uh both
 
00:53:50.789 --> 00:53:50.799 align:start position:0%
Representatives who I've worked with
 
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
diligently uh to make some changes in in
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
this statute uh um but as you have seen
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
as the questions you you have all
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
brought up are questions that we have
 
00:54:04.109 --> 00:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
had uh as we've gone as this new
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
Administration has gone the last 6 and a
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
half years so as as we move forward we
 
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
we see uh HB 279 as a step
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
forward um yes uh as as Mr Summers has
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
just uh mentioned um first I will say
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
that we have a great relationship ship
 
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
with our industry Partners our success
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
is to regulate this
 
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
industry uh for its own safety and
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
Community safety that that is our our
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
mission that is our vision moving
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
forward every day of the week um we are
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
we are bound by statuto St statuto bound
 
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
bookmarkers and those
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
bookmarkers um as you have seen in this
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
case the $2,500 in 10 days
 
00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
um it even though this establishment got
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
the the max that they could get under
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
the law it at times doesn't feel good to
 
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
some people and and representative uh
 
00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:09.799 align:start position:0%
you brought up a knowing that you're uh
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
a bartender um I won't say that I didn't
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
just send a text wondering why that we
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
have not we have a bartender out there
 
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
that has not gotten the message that we
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
give free training both online and in
 
00:55:26.029 --> 00:55:26.039 align:start position:0%
person we will actually come to your
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
establishment and train your whole
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
entire staff that's what we do uh to
 
00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
include licensing so it it does have
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
this balance of customer service base
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
and regul reg regulating the industry to
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
a safe level so when when uh uh I
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
started just to give you a little
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
historic background when I started
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
working when I first actually came in
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
stepped in the door probably a month
 
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
working with representative kill
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
on mandatory training it was met with a
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
lot of uh push back for a lack of a
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
better term um we tried to move move
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
forward with that year almost yearly uh
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
if if not every term um to see if we can
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
make some Headway this is the closest we
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
have gotten to mandatory training um an
 
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
incentive program if you will um that
 
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
has um some
 
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:31.799 align:start position:0%
promise um it has intrigued us um and
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
that is what has created our support of
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
this it's a step forward we're looking
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
at it that way is it truly where we want
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
to be it's not truly where we want to be
 
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
but it does get us to a point where a
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
establishment will see how much um uh
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
how much benefit it is not only to
 
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
community safety and and absolving them
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
from a little bit of liability but also
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
um uh uh getting their servers trained
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
in a proper fashion there are other
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
training programs out there tips is one
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
that is is mentioned quite frequently
 
00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't talk about New Hampshire
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
laws and the way we do business in the
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
603 that that that's important here we
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
do it different and we are used uh our
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement division has been
 
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
used quite frequently as a Kalia
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
accredited law enforcement agency as a
 
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:29.039 align:start position:0%
model throughout the country for control
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
States and we believe that being a
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
control state is the safest way to
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
actually sell and and um uh deal with
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
the the problems that come along with
 
00:57:40.839 --> 00:57:41.950 align:start position:0%
the the problems that come along with
alcohol

00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
service um so so we talk about uh D
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
David and myself uh have talked I
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
countless times on on Lizzy's uh
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
negative in
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
and it is sad uh you've seen a picture
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
of her she was actually team certified
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
um and leaving a licensed establishment
 
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of her shift um which makes
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
it even more sad um in talking to David
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and uh representative Mooney and
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative kahill again were all
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
under the impression that this is a
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
positive step
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
forward um and and we believe that we
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
can make a difference uh with this bill
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
passing um does it fall a little
 
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
short it falls a little short in my eyes
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
I'm a dad I have kids in this vulnerable
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
age group I I look at Liz Lizzy's was
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
only a year older than my oldest
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
daughter um it it cuts at the heart
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
we're all parents it it cuts at the
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
heart and we want to see good happen
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
here and we believe that this bill and
 
00:58:59.230 --> 00:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
moving in the right direction um is or
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799 align:start position:0%
direction thank you um with regard to
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
training how long is it um so our train
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
two training actually there's 15
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
training platforms everywhere from
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
training ownership and man
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
management um training servers training
 
00:59:24.319 --> 00:59:25.230 align:start position:0%
management um training servers training
the

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
people um on fictitious IDs and and
 
00:59:34.829 --> 00:59:34.839 align:start position:0%
identifying uh persons that um uh have
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
partake in alcoholic beverages that that
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
probably did a little too much
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
partaking um
 
00:59:48.029 --> 00:59:48.039 align:start position:0%
Grocers um our own our own liquor um
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission employees that that
 
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
sell on a daily basis so we and and and
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
teachers uh because we also regulate
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
tobacco also and talk about Vape
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
products um and what they're seeing in
 
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
the schools so um right now the the
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
training platform
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
for um elcoho would be MTS Management
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
training and lots training uh both are
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
online both are in person depending on
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
how you you wanted as an owner and that
 
01:00:24.029 --> 01:00:24.039 align:start position:0%
training class could be anywhere from
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
time wi because it is a PowerPoint pres
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
presentation with a test at the end um
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere between uh 45 minutes in an
 
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
hour if you're
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
proficient half an hour I I'd say yes
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
you could do that um but uh at the end
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
of the day it hits it earmarks all the
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
um all the items that you in taking part
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
in service all the items that you would
 
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
uh be confronted with both negative and
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
positive um that you should be aware of
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
to keep the industry safe and the
 
01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:02.670 align:start position:0%
to keep the industry safe and the
community

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
safe does your organization go to
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
license holders establishments and offer
 
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
this training absolutely and has you had
 
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
anyone ever say no thank you we're not
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
interested but not at all not at all in
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
fact I would say it's it consumes US
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
during some of our major events uh when
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
the beach opens up so when we work work
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
that that venue and I say that venue the
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
whole the whole Sea Coast when we're
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
working that holiday to holiday so from
 
01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day to Labor Day um we have
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
seasonal um establishments out there
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
seasonal lienes those
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
lienes uh we
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
actually uh for the last three years
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
have gone to Bernie's dead center on the
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
beach and they have offered us their
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
venue to to reel in every lensey that
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
wants to be trained to say this is what
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing and and I will say our
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
success is to share what we are seeing
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
in other establishments on a nightly
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
basis not to share your business
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
structure um but to share what is what
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
is going wrong not by name but by
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
circumstance and and again having that
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
open Comm communication between us and
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
our lenses has been Paramount to Our
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
Success our new success
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
so you would say that the relationship
 
01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:30.039 align:start position:0%
you have with your lenses is more of a
 
01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
Cooperative partnership than a
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency out there trying to
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
catch people up and hurt their
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
businesses absolutely so so uh Mr
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
chairman we have just and it's I it's at
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
Jael car right now so we have Rewritten
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
every one of our rules all nine eight
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
series we're going to have to create a
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
nin series series uh in the last four
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
years um that needed to to be done it it
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
it is what it is it needed to be done um
 
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
as we rewrote stuff we recognized that
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
the point system that was attached with
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
violations was
 
01:03:12.269 --> 01:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
dated um it didn't benefit anybody to
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
include ourselves as far as
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
accountability um but accountability is
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
the the time suspended accountability is
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
a current but the primary goal here is
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
the education platform and that's why
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
our prog Progressive accountability I
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
don't like calling it discipline our
 
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
Progressive accountability starts with
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
the education platform so if there is it
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
let's be honest about it there are good
 
01:03:48.269 --> 01:03:48.279 align:start position:0%
people that make mistakes and and those
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
people uh my years my Now 37 years in
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
law enforcement but my 28 years on the
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
highways of this state if people don't
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
know why they're in violation of a speed
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
infraction if they're not told why the
 
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
pros and the the the cons outweigh the
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
pros and and and at that point it's the
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
reason why we're writing a summons all
 
01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to do is do it again and
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
and that is the the foundation of what
 
01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
we've moved forward with here is you
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
need to know why why were're if we have
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
taken action on you you need to know why
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
and not the legal ease of why you need
 
01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
to know from a Layman's point of view
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
what why you've done it wrong and and
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
how we can help you to fix it and and
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I'm appreciating
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
is my phone calls during the weekend
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
from lenes and and lenses who have
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
tripped and they actually are are open
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
enough to tell you how they've tripped
 
01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
and how they can fix it and and that's
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
before somebody gets hurt so we're being
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
proactive in that regard um uh being
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
reactive is is what I used to do when I
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
worked the roadways out here and and and
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
my time in major crime and and you know
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
I always said we speak on behalf of the
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
victims and and in this case we are
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
doing that as loud as we can given the
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances we're speaking on half of
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
Lizzy right
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
now thank you um looking at the bill I
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
see a lot of a lot of significant
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
improvements it looks like a lot of work
 
01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
went into the bill um I would prefer to
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
see some type of mandatory um training
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
for all of anyone who serves liquor in
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
this state however I wouldn't want to
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
see the jeopardize the entire bill over
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
that but we're going to look into that
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
representative um new and then
 
01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
representative Bo and represent thank
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
question um I I actually bartended in a
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
former life and was tip certified um as
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
I remember uh that was in the state of
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
Colorado but as I remember um it was a
 
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
full day training um on a Saturday and
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
it's like you described with uh Bernie I
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
believe you said um and a lot of
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
different restaurants brought people I'm
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
just what I'm really trying to to wrap
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
my head around um aside from it not
 
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
being mandated is how how you could fit
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
that information that I still carry with
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
me to this day even though I'm not a
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
bartender anymore um of a full day into
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
a half an hour yeah so thank you for
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
your question representative um we're
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
we're two different types of training so
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
tips is going to give you the liability
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
portion of it but it's going to train
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
you in how to do your job we don't train
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
you how to do your job how how you
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's service or or we we train
 
01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
you and what the laws are of the state
 
01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:53.799 align:start position:0%
and and how you could get in trouble by
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
what what are the thresholds for old
 
01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
over service what are the thre what are
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
the outward signs of intoxication no
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
also know this that in the statute
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
different than a lot of statutes and
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
something I had to learn when I came
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
over there is an affirmative defense
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
built into prohibited sales and that's
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
outward signs of intoxication so if you
 
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
if the two of you as as servers aren't
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
seeing outward signs of
 
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
intoxication it is impossible for me to
 
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
take action against you and that is
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
verified through video which is not
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
mandated in any of these
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
establishments so and and there were
 
01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
some video problems in in the case that
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about not to get
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
into case facts but there you can only
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
ver you can only follow the evidence and
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
the facts of the evidence that is given
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
to you at that time you can't
 
01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
assume uh what could have happened or
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
what would would happen cuz we we
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
possibly could end up in in criminal
 
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
court with it um where we're dealing
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
with Beyond A Reasonable Doubt and not
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
the 51% in an administrative proceeding
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
so yes um you your training is longer um
 
01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
uh in tips than in MTS or in teams um
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
but we are hitting on the very facts
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about here today can
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
I follow up really quickly quick
 
01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
followup um I as I remember part of it
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
was really trying to ascertain if there
 
01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
were if there were Clues uh part of it
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
was kind of the the interaction the the
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
training on the interaction of how you
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
would ascertain U beyond that whether or
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
not someone had had uh been too
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
intoxicated but I also just wanted to
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
follow up really quickly because it was
 
01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
a question I had asked someone else and
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
they said you might have the answer do
 
01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
you know how many of the lenses have
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
taken the training What proportion I
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
actually texted when that question came
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
up I texted it to my staff I can get you
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
that number okay uh they haven't texted
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
me back at this point um but that's a
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
fluid number that changes
 
01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
hourly um I would say it's a substantial
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
number um we have 6,400 lenses in this
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
state not all of them are in our state
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
1300 of them are out of state as direct
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
shippers um we probably have around 30
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
that number moves too but about 32 to
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
3400 on premise where you you both would
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
work an on premise estab
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
establishment um the rest would be
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
combination which would be your local
 
01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:34.759 align:start position:0%
grocery store sorry your local grocery
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
store or Convenience Stores um so so yes
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
I can get you that number I I will get
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
you that number thank you I appreciate
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
that y um that just raised a question
 
01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:46.759 align:start position:0%
for me do any of the trainings you offer
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
are any of them mandatory for any of the
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
MTS which is the owners yes what about
 
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.510 align:start position:0%
MTS which is the owners yes what about
grocers

01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
grocers
 
01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh is there not to your best of your
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge some type of mandatory
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
training with regard to health from the
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh FDA and things of that nature I don't
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that question Mr
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
chairman um uh I I would I would defer
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
to them okay thanks um representative
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
rhods thank you Mr chairman I my
 
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
question is kind of two-part um is it is
 
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
it not already is it not already um
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
required for
 
01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
under for training for so you're not I'm
 
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:31.719 align:start position:0%
sorry is it not already a law for
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
establishments to be
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
trained for to not serve to minors I'm
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
sorry someone under age of 21 yeah there
 
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
is a law on that yes okay thank you and
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
then with that there was a question
 
01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
asked earlier that you you didn't touch
 
01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
upon um that I was hoping that you maybe
 
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
you would as far as the question about
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know rounds at a table so if
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
somebody you know goes over and buys a
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
picture of beer they take it back to
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
their table is there are they is the is
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
the bartender or an employee are they
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
expected to check the IDS of everybody
 
01:11:08.669 --> 01:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
at that table even if they're not taking
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
the alcohol to that table so yes thank
 
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
you for the question it's a great one um
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
so everybody in that establishment
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
ided um as they come through or paired
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
with a parent let's use the 999
 
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
Applebees of the world that are are
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants and and they're serving food
 
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
and and I know during hockey season I
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
would take my girls there for a quick
 
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.350 align:start position:0%
would take my girls there for a quick
meal

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
meal
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
um that now you have at least you have
 
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
parental oversight of of what's going on
 
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
so you know that that child nine times
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
out of 10 is not going to take a sip out
 
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
of their parent drink but as a server
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
you need to be aware of that um if a r
 
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
round I think is what you're speaking of
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
a round is purchased and brought to
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
another table um that is the
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the establishment to
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that all those people at that
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
table even though their server hasn't
 
01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
made that final service that all those
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
people that are partaken in alcoholic
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
beverages are actually of the legal age
 
01:12:17.239 --> 01:12:18.350 align:start position:0%
beverages are actually of the legal age
of

01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
drinking does that answer your question
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
I hope it does okay it does the first of
 
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
my question was um RSA
 
01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.790 align:start position:0%
my question was um RSA
179

01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
179
 
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
5B um where it says the commission shall
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
retain the right to require the lensing
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
in such a circumstance to initiate
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
additional training of the staff or
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
individual employee and so we do and and
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
upon I will say this too to to Edge your
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
point upon a violation of let's say
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
compliance we run compliance nightly uh
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
with underage buyers
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
and upon violation of that training is
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
mandatory we mandate training as part of
 
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
our negotiated
 
01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
resolution representative
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
s thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
question um which is what I asked the
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and it it goes along with
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
the concept of buying rounds or you know
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
round of shots or
 
01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
whatever um so is is the establishment I
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
guess how does the
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
establishment check the
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
sobriety level I'm not sure the right
 
01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
terminology forgive me I'm not an expert
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
in this area to of of the people they're
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
not directly serving right so they give
 
01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
Joe the plumber you know 12 shots and he
 
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
delivers them to 11 other Joe the
 
01:13:43.149 --> 01:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
plumbers and how does the restaurant or
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
establishment uh monitor that so thank
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
you for your question representative I'm
 
01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
sorry about the speaker here um uh and
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
pardon my back um so what we're what
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking at is a rate of service
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
and we're also looking at uh over over
 
01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
service so um we rely investigatively we
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
rely on
 
01:14:10.629 --> 01:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
receipts uh POS systems thank God
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
they're electronic now um and video um
 
01:14:16.159 --> 01:14:17.110 align:start position:0%
they're electronic now um and video um
if

01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
a uh establishment doesn't have that I'm
 
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
just talking in investigatively if it if
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have that we don't have it
 
01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
now that's not to say that the criminal
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
case doesn't move forward if if the
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
um if the person responsible for Lizzy's
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
death was alive they would have been
 
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
charged with negligent homicide and we
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
work very closely with the state police
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
on helping them build that
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
case um of of alcohol consumption at the
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
same time is is there
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
a um a responsibility of the
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
establishment yes both administratively
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
and criminally so we look at it from our
 
01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.709 align:start position:0%
and criminally so we look at it from our
administrative

01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
Authority um in in looking at receipts
 
01:15:11.709 --> 01:15:11.719 align:start position:0%
and looking at how the service has been
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
done the umbrella of ownership has the
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
total responsibility and all that they
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
have assumed this
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility at the same time if we
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
have seen and this has happened a rogue
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
bartender who maybe doesn't like
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
ownership and says well I'm going to get
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
them in trouble and starts floating
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
drinks down down range knowing what
 
01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing um hopefully we can build
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
a case a criminal case against that
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
which we have um I I will I think I can
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
talk about it now because it's been
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
adjudicated happy crab down in
 
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
Salem um we arrested or we
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
assisted Salem Police Department in
 
01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
arresting um that bartender we've we've
 
01:16:04.149 --> 01:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
arrested other through our uh uh legal
 
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
Authority we we have personally arrested
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
several bartenders who have egregiously
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
gone down this road it isn't something
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
we like doing to be quite honest about
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
it because we the success of this
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
industry is
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
compliance and and if you can make I
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
always say this if you can make a
 
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
bazillion dollars in compliance you're
 
01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
my poster child um I'll bring on the
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
radio show with me and we'll talk about
 
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
how your successes and how you should
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
share your successes with other
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
establishments throughout the C uh
 
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the state or the country but
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you Mr
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
chair what kind of of evidence do you
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
have that um that the training is
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
actually effective so how do you
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
measure whether or not you're having
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
impact and and are there things that you
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
can tell by your analysis that let you
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
know maybe a certain establishment might
 
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
have a problem or things of that nature
 
01:17:16.629 --> 01:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative we have several
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
barometers in this in this Factor one of
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
them being our compliance
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
if we are finding that uh a majority of
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
our establishments are in compliance are
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
iding uh through we're very active out
 
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
in the industry on a nightly basis um
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
and and we see that the service is
 
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate um through our
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
audits um we I think the the the
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
positive assumption there is that's
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
positive data that are training is
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
working um at the same time um I I will
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that to to hear somebody that
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
is not in compliance or fails compliance
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
bothers me and and I've been on the
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
phone several times with ownerships uh
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the state to say Hey listen
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you just heard this you just
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
failed compliance what can we do to get
 
01:18:21.149 --> 01:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
you let's put a training segment to that
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
together let's do this sooner than later
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
and get your whole staff in if you don't
 
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
mind paying the extra hour or so to to
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
get it done but um but yes um it it it
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
could that that is one of the barometers
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
that we use to to show us that our our
 
01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
training is
 
01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.709 align:start position:0%
training is
working

01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
follow and how do you assess whether or
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
not uh the training actually sticks with
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
the people who take it
 
01:18:58.030 --> 01:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
well first of all initially we do it
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
through our aptitude testing um because
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
you don't get the
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
certification um unless you pass pass
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
the final exam um and and I can make
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
that available for each and every one of
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
you if you find that you want to go
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
online and look at it um but at the same
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
time um it's it's literally our in in
 
01:19:25.709 --> 01:19:25.719 align:start position:0%
face cont taxs with uh industry on a
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
nightly basis just we we're we're
 
01:19:30.189 --> 01:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
constantly asking questions we're
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
constantly fortifying the
 
01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
relationships um in a very positive
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
manner uh to make sure that just
 
01:19:40.629 --> 01:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
business is done right and those items
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
that we talk about quite frequently fic
 
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
fictitious IDs over service prohibited
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
sales um that that that is all adhered
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
to and and you know that they when we're
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
asking those questions that they're
 
01:19:59.950 --> 01:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
answered in a positive F or a credible
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
fashion representative
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
Jamon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question you mentioned
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
my district I represent CBR and Hampton
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
including Hampton Beach so the question
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you is the bill changes
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
what the current suspension maximum
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
suspensions could be for first second
 
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
and third offense well third offense is
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
still advocation um what we want to do
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
for you is to give you a bigger Hammer
 
01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
cuz what what what we always say is hey
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
if they don't comply use a bigger Hammer
 
01:20:35.790 --> 01:20:35.800 align:start position:0%
so we want to do that I think you may
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
have heard my earlier question relative
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal note saying that currently
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
on the second offense it's a fine of
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
$5,000 in suspension of 30 to 60 days is
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
that correct still it it is and and the
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
point you brought up representative
 
01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:53.719 align:start position:0%
first of all well thank you for your
 
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
question um the the point you brought up
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
is something that we brought up it it is
 
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
a unintended consequence of that that
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
Gap uh I believe but again we were
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
looking at this as a step positive step
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
forward um are there things that I
 
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
personally believe need to be tightened
 
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
up some of the stuff that you've brought
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
up and other committee members have
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
brought up yes but like like Mr chairman
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
you brought up earlier um I I think this
 
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
is going in the right direction we might
 
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
we be back here next session or the
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
session after that yeah we might just to
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
but represent
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um if this lower
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
to pass how how would the however many
 
01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
3,000 establishments that actually serve
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
drinks become aware of this what how did
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
they know that this happened thank thank
 
01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
you for your question representative so
 
01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
we have a couple of um uh conduits that
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
we use to get this done uh we started an
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
industry circular six and a half years
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
ago because I felt
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
communication was lacking between us and
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
establishments if you don't know what
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
you're doing wrong or you don't know
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
what has
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
changed you're going to do it and who am
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
I to write you a on it if you don't know
 
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
about it now there are others that could
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
be even in this room that say that
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's not a defense to anything uh but
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
I I feel we have an obligation so number
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
one as soon as depending on when that
 
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
law change or when that bill comes to
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
law um we will message that out to
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
Industry we do that quite frequently
 
01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
through our industry circulars um we uh
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
it I'm I I know he'll take a shot at me
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
but Mike and I talk quite frequently
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
with restaurants and lodging but I also
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
talk to the wholesalers uh our
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers throughout the state um
 
01:23:09.390 --> 01:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
anytime that there is a law change we
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that we provide that to the
 
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
industry that they know about it we also
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
mentioning um let's use Laconia for an
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
example for bike week and and wake the
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
lake and some of those events that they
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
do we do what we call a informational
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
Blitz um I send a group of our um field
 
01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
investigators up to the region with
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
informational packets to meet with every
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
leny in that region to go over old laws
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
that they might come in contact with um
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
and new ones that have changed and maybe
 
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
you're stuck in your old way of of
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
thinking and and um that has been
 
01:23:59.709 --> 01:23:59.719 align:start position:0%
extremely successful down at the beach
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
um we do that with our seasonal
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
licensees um in our open venue um
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
establishments our our concert
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
establishments uh we do it quite often
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
with our um higher education venues uh
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
for start of school spring flings
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
graduation our high schools we do a lot
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
of training with our kid our our our
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
vulnerable age group um with our high
 
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
schools in this state on talking about
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
um what they should not be doing and
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
abstaining from and and I I will go one
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
further we also talk about um those
 
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
those vulnerable age kids that have
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
tripped and might have partaken in in
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol uh products or vape products not
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
of legal Age and what resources are out
 
01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
there for them to to receive help um
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's a different way of
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
policing um and and I believe it's it's
 
01:25:08.990 --> 01:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
our success with this group is to be
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
very open but we're an open file we're
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
transparent a just totally transparent
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
chair could you just comment one one the
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
penalties is a revocation of license and
 
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious about who the lenes are
 
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
are they the owners can some somebody
 
01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
else own a license in a restaurant uses
 
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
that license or how does that work and
 
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
is that revocation final for the leny or
 
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
the establishment it can go thank you
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
for your question representative so it
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
can go either way depending on where the
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
evidence takes us um if we see a total
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
failure by
 
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
ownership um that that owns that LLC
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
through our lure process um and the
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office um then then
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
we will hold them liable but this can
 
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
drill all the way down to a server um
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
and not being responsible um have we
 
01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
talked about ler we just did we talked
 
01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
about L individual
 
01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
ler um I would that be met with
 
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
resistance I it has uh been met with
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
resistance but it is another another
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
tool that could be used that other
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
states do um I don't think I I truly
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
believe that in the amount um this this
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
is a bad statement but we don't deal
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
with this issue often um sadly somebody
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
died from this issue and and that
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
somebody's name is Lizzie and and she
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
had her life that was a beautiful life
 
01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
that was taken away from her um I can't
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
not plug myself into that circumstance
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
myself and my wife um knowing that I
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
have kids at that are her same age and
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
she did it right she was team certified
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
so um and actually in this folder I do
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
have two things a picture of the
 
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
crash um that was horrific and a picture
 
01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
of uh or a copy of her certificate that
 
01:27:27.149 --> 01:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
I will I have uh little momentos that uh
 
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
from from families that um I in this in
 
01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:35.719 align:start position:0%
the several hundreds of homicide cases
 
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
over a 14-year career in major crime
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
that that the families have left me as
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
momentos to remember and and this will
 
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
be a momento to remember her as I do my
 
01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
job on a daily basis to the day I walk
 
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
away from this job
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today is
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who hasn't testified
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
that wishes to testify on this bill just
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
one one last thing j representative
 
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
Pratt just one quick one uh how you
 
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
doing uh I have a quick question here do
 
01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
you still do spot inspections where send
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
people in to do uh buying that maybe
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
Miner send miners in to do inspections
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely and then also license renewal
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
inspections you still do license
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah so those are pretty Thor
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
I know in my past and and that is an
 
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our investigators to go
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
out and actually speak about what has
 
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
changed very good point representative
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um so that when we do
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
those in uh those inspections it it is
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
all it is all around a conversation
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
about what has changed how business is
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
going and what we can do to help you be
 
01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
more successful um but we always talk
 
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
about the elephant in the room and
 
01:28:53.950 --> 01:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
that's the negative that Could Happen um
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's it has a lot of liability around it
 
01:28:59.950 --> 01:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
as you know from from you know your
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
service your public service um there's a
 
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
lot of liability around that that uh
 
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
could go negative really quick thank you
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
thank you again thank you for your
 
01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:20.910 align:start position:0%
thank you again thank you for your
testimony

01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
ma'am if you have something new to add
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely you got to push the excuse
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
me am I live okay sorry um this is just
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
in response to something the
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner said which I want to
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
clarify and I think is often an area of
 
01:29:51.149 --> 01:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
confusion in certainly civil cases
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
involving the liability of
 
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
establishments that serve alcohol but
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
apparently also confusion I think for
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
the commission I heard the commissioner
 
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
say there's an absolute defense an
 
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
affirmative defense for an entity to a
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
claim that they were um over serving if
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
the person was not visibly
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
intoxicated um we in litigating this
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
case uh came up against that issue
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
numerous times and although there are
 
01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
affirmative defenses under the statute
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
which say if a business can show that
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
they've been involved in reasonable
 
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
business practices they may be able to
 
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:39.400 align:start position:0%
fend off liability the statute
 
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
specifically says that a entity is
 
01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
responsible if they bartenders or
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
servers serve somebody who is visibly
 
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
intoxicated or whom a reasonable person
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
would know is intoxicated and in this
 
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
case you had in both entities servers
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
saying there were no visible signs of
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
intoxication and part of how we proved
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
that there was the the person was
 
01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
intoxicated and they should have known
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
that was from how much they had been
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
served over what period of time and
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
there's actually a federal court opinion
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
from Judge llant that said is it's not
 
01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
just visible signs of intoxication so I
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
say that just because I hate to have on
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
the record some um sense that if
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
somebody's not visibly intoxicated you
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
can keep serving them you know if
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who holds their liquor
 
01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh sort of invisibly that you're free to
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
serve them as much as you want thank you
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
um speaking of on the record before you
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
leave could you fill out a pink card for
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
us so we have you and I'm not it's one
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
more question um the reason person
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
standard raises an interesting question
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
because what does a reasonable person
 
01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
know about alcohol and how much and if
 
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
you have to take training your
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
reasonableness is the bar goes a little
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
bit higher because now it's a reasonable
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
trained person versus a reasonable
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
untrained person would you agree uh I
 
01:32:15.109 --> 01:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
would say that's true um but because
 
01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
training isn't
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
mandatory um we have a situation where
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking at some people
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
um for instance representative Murray
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
who is serving people and is untrained
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
so what standard are you going to apply
 
01:32:33.149 --> 01:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
the reasonable person standard has to be
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
the lowest an untrained person however
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
if it were mandatory that would raise
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
that that bar wouldn't it right and in
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
this case although the owners are
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
required to take this MTS Management
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
training they then in in the case of one
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
of these bars did not turn around and do
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
any in-house training themselves
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
specific to over service or at least
 
01:33:01.149 --> 01:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
that was the testimony from the servers
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
was that their management had never
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
passed on any training to them even
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
though they had received the training
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your addition
 
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
today um with that I'm going to close
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
this public hearing and I would ask the
 
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
Republicans to meet me in my office
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to probably exec this bill
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
today if anyone's interested in staying
 
01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:20.550 align:start position:0%
today if anyone's interested in staying
for

01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:50.550 align:start position:0%
for
that

01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:37:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
spe

01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um with that I'm opening the
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
279 and excuse me uh 279 and I am going
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
to recognize myself I make a motion of a
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
to pass have a second representative
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
Jamber in
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
seconds and real quick um I saw some
 
01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
things in this bill that I would like to
 
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
see changed having said that this was a
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
Commerce bill first and I respect their
 
01:37:50.199 --> 01:37:51.750 align:start position:0%
Commerce bill first and I respect their
decision

01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:37:55.629 --> 01:37:55.639 align:start position:0%
um having said that I I do think some
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
things need to be toughened up including
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
the the mandatory training and I look
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
forward to see what happens in the
 
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
Senate having said that this has a still
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
a bit to travel so we're going to move
 
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:06.760 align:start position:0%

chairman I I agree um the second offense
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
is lighter than what it currently is and
 
01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
I and I think that it should be
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
toughened uh however uh the time can be
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
done that can be done in the Senate and
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh we can recommend that as members of
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%

Manos couldn't be here today so I am a
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and introducing the bill I'm
 
01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
wiam this bill seeks to
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
have petitions for domestic violence or
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
stalking filed
 
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
electronically the court has been trying
 
01:43:51.149 --> 01:43:51.159 align:start position:0%
to move cases a little bit at of time
 
01:43:54.030 --> 01:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
over a 10year process to be electronic
 
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
many of them are still in hard copy
 
01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:59.350 align:start position:0%
many of them are still in hard copy
format

01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
format
 
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
and that makes it difficult to for for
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
for multiple judges to be able to look
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
at something you've got a hard copy of a
 
01:44:11.229 --> 01:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
file and there are times
 
01:44:14.669 --> 01:44:14.679 align:start position:0%
when somebody will have a criminal
 
01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
protective order against person a will
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
have it against person B because
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
something happen and somebody was
 
01:44:25.149 --> 01:44:25.159 align:start position:0%
arrested person B can then go into
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
family court and not tell them that
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
there's already a protective order
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
against them and person B can then get a
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
protective order against person
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
a the police have to go by which order
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
was issued latest now they're likely
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
going to ask for the person a is
 
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
obviously very likely going to ask for
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
an emergency hearing it'll be heard
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
within 5 days but in the meantime
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
they're likely going to be kicked out of
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
their house there quite a few examples
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
that we heard of this happening with
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
different family law attorneys and so
 
01:44:58.109 --> 01:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
that was one of the reasons for putting
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
in this bill another reason for putting
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
in the bill was just simply to be able
 
01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:03.669 align:start position:0%
in the bill was just simply to be able
to

01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
have more statistical data on these
 
01:45:09.629 --> 01:45:09.639 align:start position:0%
types of cases so these petitions to be
 
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
clear are petitions that usually happen
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
in Family Court they're not criminal um
 
01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
cases um
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
and even though it's in your committee
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
which I guess confusing because you guys
 
01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
usually deal with the criminal ones but
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
this is these are ones that would
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't happen in in criminal
 
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
court so that was the reason for putting
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
this in there was a little bit of
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
concern in here related
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
to the fact that it had said shall be
 
01:45:44.189 --> 01:45:44.199 align:start position:0%
electronically filed
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
and um the idea that it said that a
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
party could be excused under the
 
01:45:51.790 --> 01:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances that it would create a
 
01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:53.470 align:start position:0%
circumstances that it would create a
hardship

01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
hardship
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
and there was a little bit of a concern
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
that somebody may be able to use that
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
for a reason of appeal in a true devv
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
situation and say well you know their
 
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstance was that they
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
didn't have a car and I don't think that
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's extraordinary and then try and
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
use it for a reason of appeal and so for
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
that reason we would be okay changing
 
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
this from Shell to May and then removing
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
the second sentence um but that's that's
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
what the bill does and I'm happy to take
 
01:46:21.070 --> 01:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
any question
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um first of all if
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
we get if we get that far that an
 
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is appropriate in the
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
committee belief so then we're going to
 
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
ask you to get whatever amendments that
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
are necessary um representative Jamon
 
01:46:38.189 --> 01:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh currently uh
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
the police show up your at your doorstep
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
for a domestic call and they believe
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
there's an emergency situation and they
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
must have a protective order in place
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
within minutes um they then pick up the
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
phone I'm I'm I'm asking this is part of
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
a question they immediately call a judge
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
the judge issues an order over the phone
 
01:47:02.589 --> 01:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
and then a paper copy of that order is
 
01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
then forwarded to the police department
 
01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
to be served on the second party um
 
01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
would your bill neuter that and not
 
01:47:13.709 --> 01:47:13.719 align:start position:0%
allow the telephonic order order or is
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
it is it in compliment to
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
that attorney krian can probably give
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
better data than but I don't believe
 
01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
right now I think you would still have
 
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
to fill out unless it was criminal if it
 
01:47:27.629 --> 01:47:27.639 align:start position:0%
was going to be this is again not for
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
criminal this is civil so somebody
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
hasn't committed a crime you're going to
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
have to fill out a petition and usually
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
the petitions are done during working
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
hours it's a very rare circumstance when
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
something would be granted outside of
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
hours and attorney crean might have the
 
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
data on exactly how often that happens
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
but it's very seldom that that would
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
happen but yes it is all hard C copy and
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
there's one copy in the court um and
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's you know kind of another thing
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
with with hard copy files if anything
 
01:47:58.750 --> 01:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
ever happens to the court we don't have
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
a a copy of that there's no electronic
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
copy thank
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question is
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
what this says is anything petitions
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
filed on or after um July 1st 2025 and
 
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
so my question is if there's something
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
that's existing at that time would that
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
also be electronically filed or is it
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
just for things that are happening after
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
that so is it for petitions that um that
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
are filed on or after that time or
 
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
anything that is in existence at that
 
01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
time would be electronically filed so
 
01:48:35.189 --> 01:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
that it could be shared it would be from
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
petitions that are filed from that from
 
01:48:39.589 --> 01:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
that period on so you know existing
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
cases or cases that didn't have
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
decisions yet those wouldn't be included
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
in here because this strictly talks to
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
petitions from from then forward okay
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.189 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
representative

01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
scitec I'm a little confused it's you
 
01:48:58.350 --> 01:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
say this the title is relative the
 
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
electronic filing of domestic violence
 
01:49:04.510 --> 01:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
civil that's
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
just they're done in Family Court that's
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
what it that's just how it's done so
 
01:49:14.830 --> 01:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're parties that are either
 
01:49:18.189 --> 01:49:18.199 align:start position:0%
related to each other or they're done um
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
or they're in a relation ship with each
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
other there's certain criteria that
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
those that those fall
 
01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
into but it's not a crime has not been
 
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
the person hasn't been arrested for
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
something prior to these
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
happening okay I expect a more in-depth
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%

Kylie

01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
um good morning Mr chair and members of
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
the committee um as you know my name is
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
Pamela kyg and I'm the public policy
 
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
specialist at the New Hampshire
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
Coalition against Domestic and Sexual
 
01:50:12.669 --> 01:50:12.679 align:start position:0%
Violence um I am here today also with my
 
01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
colleague Joy um who is our program
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
director and um we just kind of wanted
 
01:50:20.589 --> 01:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
to Echo what um representative kutab
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
said that we share similar concerns and
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
would recommend that the language in the
 
01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
bill be changed from Sha to May and I do
 
01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
have a suggested amendment of language
 
01:50:31.709 --> 01:50:31.719 align:start position:0%
that I will pass around with my
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
testimony um and we're happy to answer
 
01:50:36.669 --> 01:50:36.679 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have related to
 
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
the protective orders for both um
 
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
domestic violence under 173b and
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
stocking under 633 um 3A I think and
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
then um I think just the the Crux of Our
 
01:50:50.109 --> 01:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
Testimony is that we just feel very
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
strongly that mandatory um electronic
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
filing um is not in the best interest of
 
01:50:58.030 --> 01:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
victim safety are we feel very strongly
 
01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
that we want to create more options so
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's why we're we are open and excited
 
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
for the possibility of having electronic
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
filing as an option but want to make
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
sure that inperson filing and um also a
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
remote process that we've been piloting
 
01:51:15.390 --> 01:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
with the court since uh 20120 um remain
 
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:17.639 align:start position:0%
intact um just so that victims and
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
survivors have as many options a aable
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
to meet their safety needs as they're uh
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
seeking relief uh from the courts um I
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
think my colleague Joy will just quickly
 
01:51:28.750 --> 01:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
highlight some of the key concerns that
 
01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to make sure we're on
 
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
your radar um with a solely uh
 
01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.790 align:start position:0%
your radar um with a solely uh
electronic

01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
process thank you um so as as Pamela had
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned we um implemented in 2020 um
 
01:51:44.430 --> 01:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
as we were recognizing the significant
 
01:51:46.350 --> 01:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
barriers that survivors were facing due
 
01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:47.149 align:start position:0%
barriers that survivors were facing due
to

01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um we formed a
 
01:51:51.790 --> 01:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary committee that was um
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
looking at uh allowing temporary
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
electronic filing options um filing the
 
01:52:00.910 --> 01:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
petitions uh during regular business
 
01:52:03.069 --> 01:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
hours at the court uh the committee was
 
01:52:05.069 --> 01:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
comprised of Court staff New Hampshire
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
legal assistants uh the Coalition and
 
01:52:09.629 --> 01:52:09.639 align:start position:0%
private attorneys among other experts
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
and stakeholders this process was
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
intentionally created to balance the
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
safety needs of survivors and the
 
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
existing technology systems available
 
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
through the court
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
um through this process survivors work
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
directly with crisis centers to file
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
these remote email petitions and they
 
01:52:30.430 --> 01:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
would also be directly connected to
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
Legal Services the remote filing is
 
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
still available today even though we no
 
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
longer have the concern of covid-19 um
 
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
and most crisis centers continue to use
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
this as an option when working with
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
survivors some of the concerns uh that
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
we have that was stated previously we we
 
01:52:52.229 --> 01:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
oppose that this bill um is would be
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
mandatory it would be mandatory for
 
01:52:56.589 --> 01:52:56.599 align:start position:0%
people to file petitions electronically
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
um and that there would be any type of
 
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
sort of red tape uh requirements to
 
01:53:02.910 --> 01:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that victims are allowed to
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
file in person it's really important to
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
keep those options open because every
 
01:53:08.189 --> 01:53:08.199 align:start position:0%
Survivor is the expert in their
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
situation and their safety and we want
 
01:53:13.069 --> 01:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
to make things as accessible for them as
 
01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
possible when seeking uh orders of
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
protection and um one specific concern
 
01:53:22.109 --> 01:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
uh some of our specific concerns that we
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
have is that this legislation as written
 
01:53:26.910 --> 01:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
would require uh demonstrating that
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
electric filing is a
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
hardship um and as written it would
 
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
actually discourage survivors from
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
coming forward um because again it's
 
01:53:37.149 --> 01:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
another barrier that we're putting in
 
01:53:39.629 --> 01:53:39.639 align:start position:0%
place and there's no consideration for
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
language needs and Technology barriers
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
so not everyone is it's not you know we
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
really need to take into consideration
 
01:53:48.430 --> 01:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
making these things as accessible as
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
possible for anybody
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
um Tech safety concerns uh could also be
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
a serious issue for survivors because we
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
really want to think about what what
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
does that look like in the court if
 
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
people are electronically filing at a
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
kiosk so to speak in the middle of the
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
courthouse how is that safe uh what
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
happens if their perpetrator shows up at
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
the court um so again these are things
 
01:54:12.790 --> 01:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
that we want to take into consideration
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
and obviously the impact on survivors
 
01:54:17.470 --> 01:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
with disabilities uh Child Care issues
 
01:54:18.870 --> 01:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
people may not be able to get to the
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
courts um in order to file due to not
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
having Child Care um time constraints
 
01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
and privacy and then how again would
 
01:54:30.669 --> 01:54:30.679 align:start position:0%
would survivors get connected to
 
01:54:32.430 --> 01:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
resources such as crisis centers and
 
01:54:35.790 --> 01:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
legal services if they're filing um
 
01:54:38.589 --> 01:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
electronically on their own yeah um and
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to expand on that if there
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
are any more specific questions but I
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
think in summary we just really
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work of the sponsors on
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
this and the level of collaboration that
 
01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
we've had to um look into how this
 
01:54:54.030 --> 01:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
process might work um and just uh really
 
01:54:55.709 --> 01:54:55.719 align:start position:0%
strongly urge that the language be
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
changed to May so that the option is
 
01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
available but it's not the sole option
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
um for victims and we'd be more than
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Stone
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:55:13.629 --> 01:55:13.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you explain to me
 
01:55:15.629 --> 01:55:15.639 align:start position:0%
in your opinion what an extraordinary
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances would
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
be I think that's a really great
 
01:55:22.030 --> 01:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
question representative I'm not entirely
 
01:55:25.709 --> 01:55:25.719 align:start position:0%
sure um what the the vision was behind
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
that language but I I would argue that
 
01:55:30.589 --> 01:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
um someone fleeing abuse who may have
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
been strangled or any other thing is
 
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
already experiencing an extraordinary
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
hardship followup so in reference to the
 
01:55:41.790 --> 01:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
actual filing of the of a petition uh I
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
guess I heard some of your testimonies
 
01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
that it's kind of Envision an individual
 
01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
could go to an organization that would
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
help them on their behalf fill out the
 
01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
electronic filing or go go to a court
 
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
which obviously we are all aware that I
 
01:55:53.669 --> 01:55:53.679 align:start position:0%
believe most courts in New Hampshire
 
01:55:55.069 --> 01:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
staff of court security Personnel that
 
01:55:57.149 --> 01:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
have powers of arrest as well so it
 
01:55:59.470 --> 01:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
should be a safe environment uh I do
 
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:02.719 align:start position:0%
agree that the shell language is uh kind
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
of strong and may would be a better
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
venue in my opinion but the
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstances is the one I
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
had the real issue with I couldn't
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
Envision what you would Define as one
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think there was really
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
good intent um with the idea I think uh
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there could be an
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
option if electronic filing wasn't
 
01:56:24.069 --> 01:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
feasible but I just I think our concern
 
01:56:26.109 --> 01:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
is that if someone's already going to
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
the court to file a petition we don't
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
want them to have to have that initial
 
01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
step to demonstrate and that it could
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
actually be inadvertently used um by
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
abusers um to make it even harder so
 
01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:37.750 align:start position:0%
abusers um to make it even harder so
thank

01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
you to the best of your knowledge does
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
the bill allow electronic filing like
 
01:56:45.069 --> 01:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
from home or does it have to be at a
 
01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
centralized location it uh it's our
 
01:56:49.709 --> 01:56:49.719 align:start position:0%
understanding the intention of of this
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
bill would uh would indicate that uh
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
individuals would have to go to the
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
court in order to electronically file
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
and not file from home I think I think
 
01:56:59.950 --> 01:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
that's a really great question and I
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
think maybe the courts could lend some
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
um recommendations into what the
 
01:57:06.350 --> 01:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure would look like I think
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh right now there there was um in in
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
talking with the sponsors um there was
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
thought of you know do we have a kiosk
 
01:57:15.069 --> 01:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
like um for some of the other petitions
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
that are filed is there a platform
 
01:57:19.629 --> 01:57:19.639 align:start position:0%
online um and I think until those pie
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
are ironed out and we know what that
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
looks like I think it's hard to know if
 
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
there's any other considerations that
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
might need to be in
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
place I just I I worry that um online is
 
01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
is very dangerous because oftentimes
 
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
abusers will look at internet history
 
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
and you could end up in a worse
 
01:57:40.069 --> 01:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
situation you started with but that
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps isn't an issue today um further
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative here at gather thank you
 
01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
ch um my question is today
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
you can go into the courts correct but
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
did you also say that you still can do
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
online so we we'll clarify that yeah yes
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
so um today survivors have the option of
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
going to the court to file um themselves
 
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
or with any support person including a
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
crisis center Advocate um to help
 
01:58:12.430 --> 01:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
support them through that process they
 
01:58:14.069 --> 01:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
may also have a legal counsel or
 
01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
representation that can help them
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
through that process with filing there
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
is also another option
 
01:58:23.069 --> 01:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
um where survivors can work with crisis
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
centers to um to remotely file a
 
01:58:30.510 --> 01:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
petition that goes directly to the court
 
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
um so they can do that in their offices
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
um it's a safe and comfortable
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
environment they can also bring their
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
children um and there would be the you
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
know just eliminates a lot of barriers
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
because they're already getting
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
connected to those crisis center
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
Services right away and they can file
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
that petition remotely there yeah and So
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
like um my colleague mentioned this was
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
something that was crafted in 2020 in
 
01:58:56.910 --> 01:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
May 2020 during the Crux of covid um
 
01:58:58.109 --> 01:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
when we knew that getting to the
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
courthouse was especially challenging
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
for survivors um and so uh while the you
 
01:59:06.069 --> 01:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
know the initial sort of Nexus for why
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
we have this is no longer the same the
 
01:59:10.589 --> 01:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
issue we have today um this process
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
Still Remains available um not a lot of
 
01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
petitions are filed this way but we have
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
found that it's been very helpful
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
especially for survivors with dis
 
01:59:21.069 --> 01:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
abilities who may not physically be able
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
to get to the court or in cases where
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know there are multiple children who
 
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
maybe the the person doesn't have a
 
01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
caregiver and can then work with the
 
01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
advocate at the crisis center to submit
 
01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
it but there's a very strict criteria um
 
01:59:36.589 --> 01:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
of how that um can be filed and it again
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
has to be um you know the the purpose
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
being that they would have the support
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
they need to file it remotely um it's
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
not anyone at home that can access this
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
process thank
 
01:59:48.239 --> 01:59:51.229 align:start position:0%
process thank
you

01:59:51.229 --> 01:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you also
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
I want to take the a moment that um
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
whenever we have a domestic violence
 
01:59:58.109 --> 01:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
issue here I think it's important we
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
bring up the fact that there may be
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
people at home watching um you can
 
02:00:06.430 --> 02:00:06.440 align:start position:0%

02:00:29.709 --> 02:00:29.719 align:start position:0%
courts hello Representatives just
 
02:00:31.069 --> 02:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
appearing on behalf of the judicial
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
branch to discuss
 
02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.639 align:start position:0%
1177 um and I want to start by saying
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
that we appreciate so much that we've
 
02:00:39.069 --> 02:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
had a lot of Engagement with the uh
 
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill they've come over
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
to the court system we've walked them
 
02:00:43.470 --> 02:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
through some of the filing options that
 
02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
we have um and I hope we'll continue
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
having a conversation with them um just
 
02:00:51.149 --> 02:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
sort of three principles I I want to
 
02:00:52.669 --> 02:00:52.679 align:start position:0%
orient you to with the bill and the
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
first is that the courts are absolutely
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
supportive of having more efiling
 
02:00:59.709 --> 02:00:59.719 align:start position:0%
options for for state courts throughout
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
the country uh it is a generally a
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
gradual transition from paper filing to
 
02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
electronic filing some states have
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
completed it Most states in the New
 
02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
England region have not um so it is a
 
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
process we have been working on for over
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
12 years um and we would absolutely love
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
to add optional uh electronic filing for
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
for domestic violence survivors it is
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
expensive um and that is typically the
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
barrier every time we add a new case
 
02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
type we have to contract with an ecourt
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
Filer and and there's a cost that is
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
usually in the hundreds of thousands
 
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
associated with transitioning that case
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
type over which is a carry-on cost um so
 
02:01:37.629 --> 02:01:37.639 align:start position:0%
that is why it is a a gradual process
 
02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
typically but um if if the legislature
 
02:01:41.950 --> 02:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
wants to to focus on particular areas
 
02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
and and move those to electronic filing
 
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
um we supportive we would love to have
 
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
those options um we do not typically
 
02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
require a person who wants to do a paper
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
filing even in a an electronic case type
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate any kind of special need
 
02:01:58.910 --> 02:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
there are a large number of
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigants in New
 
02:02:02.830 --> 02:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if they're not comfortable
 
02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
or they don't have access to the
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
internet um we we allow them to come in
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
and give us a paper filing even in an
 
02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
electronic case type so um that's even
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
though we try to make sure that more is
 
02:02:14.350 --> 02:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
available electronically we we don't
 
02:02:16.270 --> 02:02:16.280 align:start position:0%
want to exclude anyone who wants to file
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
by paper um for domes violence survivors
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
in particular the paper case type is a
 
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
very popular option even though in 2020
 
02:02:28.350 --> 02:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
we at no cost created our own impromptu
 
02:02:30.990 --> 02:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
email filing system with the working
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
with the Coalition and others 95% of
 
02:02:35.709 --> 02:02:35.719 align:start position:0%
domestic violence survivors continue to
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
use the paper option um there could be
 
02:02:40.109 --> 02:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
any number of reasons that this is true
 
02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
it it could be that they just feel
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
physically safer coming into the
 
02:02:43.950 --> 02:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
courthouse it could be their worried
 
02:02:44.830 --> 02:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
someone's going to look at their
 
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
internet history uh but for whatever
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
reason this remains a very popular
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
option and we would have concerned if it
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
didn't remain an option um we would
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
certainly be happy to add the additional
 
02:02:57.750 --> 02:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
option of going to a contractor and
 
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
specifically Building A system that has
 
02:03:02.189 --> 02:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
a safe button that someone can press and
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
they can get away from that screen if
 
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
their abuser is in their presence we we'
 
02:03:07.709 --> 02:03:07.719 align:start position:0%
want to design an electronic man uh
 
02:03:10.109 --> 02:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
filing system that works for domestic
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
violence survivors and and we would we
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
would absolutely love to do that but we
 
02:03:16.270 --> 02:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to take an option away that a
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of survivors use um it's
 
02:03:22.109 --> 02:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
still a very very high highly utilized
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
solution um so I I've I've I've told you
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
about our our gradual path toward
 
02:03:29.229 --> 02:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
electronic filing we are working on it
 
02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
and some of the unfortunate costs that
 
02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
that can come with making those
 
02:03:35.229 --> 02:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
transitions um a a very sort of minor
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
flag it's just drafting wise this has
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
been something and I know that the prime
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor was concerned about this and
 
02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's a very good flag because I know
 
02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
she's an attorney that this has
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
typically been a process which the
 
02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
courts have done through the
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
administrative Authority that the the
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
courts have to make decisions which
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
administer the courts and it has not
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
typically been something that the
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
legislature has been involved in so
 
02:03:55.470 --> 02:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
every time we've transitioned a case
 
02:03:56.549 --> 02:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
type we' we've done it by an
 
02:03:57.790 --> 02:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
administrative order because we've been
 
02:04:00.430 --> 02:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
able to get the funds to do it um so
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
there's special drafting concerns but I
 
02:04:05.229 --> 02:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
think those are completely overcomable
 
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of how the legislation is
 
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
phrased because we would absolutely love
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
to work with you to add this as an
 
02:04:13.229 --> 02:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
option for
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
survivors would it be safe to say that
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
this would pass constitutional muster
 
02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
with the separation ation if it were
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
more enabling versus mandatory for the
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
courts yes and if the legislation were
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
to pass as even as amended as suggested
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
taking out the shell does the court have
 
02:04:32.830 --> 02:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
the funds because I see the fiscal note
 
02:04:35.790 --> 02:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's no money um attached to
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
it the cost is about $300,000 to to add
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
this as a new uh electronic filing case
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
type so we would need to get new funds
 
02:04:47.549 --> 02:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
for that but we would utilize them and
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
we would absolutely did you get did you
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
get the request for the fiscal note for
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
on the legislation we did and I I had
 
02:04:55.229 --> 02:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
thought that it was noted there is it
 
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
not on oh maybe it is I just saw
 
02:05:01.549 --> 02:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
zeros okay um representative
 
02:05:04.549 --> 02:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
rhods thank you Mr chairman if could you
 
02:05:06.189 --> 02:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
just clarify I wasn't sure if you said
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
if it was 90 or 95% of um the victims
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
that use the the paper filing option can
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:20.109 --> 02:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
you representative sitec uh we heard
 
02:05:22.830 --> 02:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
that there was a the court was doing a
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
pilot program in 2020 and all why do you
 
02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
even need this legislation why can't you
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
just do it in order to uh build a a
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
platform a website that people can log
 
02:05:35.709 --> 02:05:35.719 align:start position:0%
into that's going to have the features
 
02:05:37.549 --> 02:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
that are going to be safe for survivors
 
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
to use like a safe screen button there's
 
02:05:41.229 --> 02:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
just a certain cost associated with
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
building and maintaining that system
 
02:05:46.669 --> 02:05:46.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me um but what we did in 2020
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
because we had to immediately deal with
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
the p pmic and we had to do something um
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
was we created basically a form that
 
02:05:54.069 --> 02:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
people can email us and we receive it as
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
an email and we process it so that's not
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
what you get with e filing typically
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
what you get is an interface where you
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
can answer questions which is intended
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
to be much more userfriendly um there
 
02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
are technical issues sometimes with our
 
02:06:10.990 --> 02:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
totally self done um email system that
 
02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
is is not at the level of functionality
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
that a a fully designed ecort filing
 
02:06:17.390 --> 02:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
system would be it is utilized by about
 
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
5% of survivors so it's not that it's
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
not utilized and I think it was helpful
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
to have during the pandemic but you
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
would get something additional and it
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
might get a higher utilization if it was
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
a fully designed ecourt system followup
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
please followup what I heard is who's
 
02:06:32.589 --> 02:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
pay isn't that really what I heard
 
02:06:36.390 --> 02:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's going to be through the our
 
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
budget process or the Court's budget it
 
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
it is it is a a large expense and I if
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
it were mandated without funds I am I am
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
not certain how we would resolve that
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
issue thank
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you is there
 
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify on this
 
02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
pill who has not testified on the spill
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will close the public
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:17.520 --> 02:13:16.950 align:start position:0%
 
break

02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:16.960 --> 02:22:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.950 --> 02:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm here by opening the
 
02:23:03.790 --> 02:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
1177 and I recognize representative here
 
02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
motion I motion to itl HB
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
1177 uh I'll second Mr chair thank you
 
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
representative here Gaff would you like
 
02:23:24.990 --> 02:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion yes sir um what
 
02:23:27.389 --> 02:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
we have today from what I understand we
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
already have electronic fing if someone
 
02:23:34.190 --> 02:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
chooses to go to um let's say a
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
designated lo location um verse being at
 
02:23:44.110 --> 02:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
the state in into the normal um office
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
so with that said I I think we already
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
have two ways of folling electronically
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
in a safe location as well as going in
 
02:23:59.710 --> 02:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
and um using paper so um I would say
 
02:24:03.070 --> 02:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
if if the department chooses that they
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
want to look at um electronic filing
 
02:24:07.630 --> 02:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
only in their location I believe that's
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
something that should be worked out
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
within that department not necessarily
 
02:24:14.429 --> 02:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
come before us to make that decision for
 
02:24:14.439 --> 02:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
come before us to make that decision for
a

02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:24:18.030 --> 02:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
department but Department you mean like
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary yes okay representative
 
02:24:22.349 --> 02:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
rhs would you like to speak to your
 
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
second thank you Mr chairman um I I Echo
 
02:24:28.870 --> 02:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
everything that uh representative herck
 
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
gri said I also just would like to
 
02:24:33.790 --> 02:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
mention that the the
 
02:24:35.870 --> 02:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
opposition that it seems like we're all
 
02:24:38.309 --> 02:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
in agreement to is this is not a time to
 
02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
be taking away any options from a person
 
02:24:43.630 --> 02:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
that needs to have their voices heard
 
02:24:46.349 --> 02:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
and whatever option that they have that
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
they feel is best for them is is what we
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
need to make available to them and
 
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
making it easier not more difficult by
 
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
any means so thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:24:57.870 --> 02:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
you I I would add that
 
02:25:00.590 --> 02:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
um the the sponsors seem to be open to
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
the idea of making it uh maybe instead
 
02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
of a shell but if it becomes a maybe
 
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
there's already a maybe available so I'm
 
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
not really entirely sure of the goal of
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
the legislation if it's to to make a
 
02:25:14.110 --> 02:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
more efficient system to track
 
02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
statistics to know what what's going on
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
I think there's a a better way to do
 
02:25:21.309 --> 02:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
that that if they work with the uh
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
Judiciary in advance um that we could
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
maybe come up with a more streamlined
 
02:25:29.790 --> 02:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
bill that has a clear goal versus um
 
02:25:31.150 --> 02:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
something that we're really not entirely
 
02:25:32.910 --> 02:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
sure what it does if we change it
 
02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:34.469 align:start position:0%
sure what it does if we change it

02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
little nervous it's first time I'm
 
02:26:55.950 --> 02:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
introducing my own bill so to introduce
 
02:26:57.790 --> 02:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
myself I am representative Lauren selig
 
02:26:59.469 --> 02:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
I represent the town of Durham New
 
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is straford 10 um and
 
02:27:04.910 --> 02:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'm one of our Representatives um House
 
02:27:07.870 --> 02:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 1214 is a bill to create a study
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
committee to look at Best Practices for
 
02:27:12.750 --> 02:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
the de um related to the development of
 
02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
a restor restorative justice model for
 
02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor behavior and hate crimes
 
02:27:21.309 --> 02:27:21.319 align:start position:0%
committed by juveniles um under the age
 
02:27:23.349 --> 02:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
of 18 and I know that that essentially
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
restates what a juvenile is but just to
 
02:27:29.269 --> 02:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
be explicit um how this came about as an
 
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
idea for me is over the summer there was
 
02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
um a surge in hate crimes around the Sea
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
Coast in particular a lot of it was
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
graffiti based but there were a number
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
of other somewhat more malicious crimes
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
that were occurring in the area um and
 
02:27:45.750 --> 02:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
there are some indication that some of
 
02:27:47.230 --> 02:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
it was more of it was was being caused
 
02:27:49.550 --> 02:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
by young people than others um there's
 
02:27:51.309 --> 02:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
also been you know surge in my
 
02:27:54.030 --> 02:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
daughter's uh High School of people
 
02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
putting hateful symbols in bathrooms and
 
02:28:00.110 --> 02:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
and other places um at the same time as
 
02:28:02.349 --> 02:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
that I was reading about the Howard
 
02:28:05.469 --> 02:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
County Maryland's Teen Court program
 
02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
where um they have a a program where
 
02:28:10.349 --> 02:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
teens serve as the members of the Court
 
02:28:12.269 --> 02:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
they're supervised by adults but their
 
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
teens who either themselves had brushes
 
02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
with the judicial system or where they
 
02:28:17.790 --> 02:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
have an interest in learning more about
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
the judicial system and they work
 
02:28:22.429 --> 02:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
together with teens who have committed
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
an offense to identify um a way for them
 
02:28:29.150 --> 02:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
to improve their behavior and make
 
02:28:31.309 --> 02:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
restoration to whomever they've harmed
 
02:28:34.510 --> 02:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
by their behavior and in recognizing
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
that putting more people in jail isn't
 
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
going to stop people from um having
 
02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
feelings and emotions and isn't going to
 
02:28:43.550 --> 02:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily help fix these things I
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
started thinking well what could we do
 
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
to really take teens in particular and
 
02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
help them understand the severity of
 
02:28:53.429 --> 02:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
their actions before they end up in a
 
02:28:55.950 --> 02:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
long-term placement in a judicial system
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
and maybe end up needing the to be in
 
02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
the judicial system for the rest of
 
02:29:01.710 --> 02:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
their lives or in some way that impacts
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
the rest of their lives and so I spoke
 
02:29:07.230 --> 02:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
with members of the ACLU I spoke with um
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
one of the attorneys at the Attorney
 
02:29:11.269 --> 02:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
General's office um who works in their
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
hate crimes
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
Division and I spoke with people who
 
02:29:16.590 --> 02:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
work in restorative justice with youth
 
02:29:19.030 --> 02:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
models already um and there are some
 
02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
models that exist but they're all
 
02:29:24.190 --> 02:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
adult-led um and they don't necessarily
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
all end up being successful the Howard
 
02:29:29.389 --> 02:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
County model um has had a 94% success
 
02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
rate um their
 
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
recidivism um sorry that word's been
 
02:29:37.269 --> 02:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
tripping me up has been very very low um
 
02:29:39.790 --> 02:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
students have have the the young people
 
02:29:41.070 --> 02:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
who have ended up involved in their
 
02:29:42.830 --> 02:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
juvenile court system and their peer
 
02:29:45.950 --> 02:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
court system have had very few instances
 
02:29:48.349 --> 02:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
of re defending and
 
02:29:50.269 --> 02:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
so I started thinking there are all
 
02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
these different ways and we do have some
 
02:29:52.990 --> 02:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
programs that are working in New
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but maybe need to be tweaked
 
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
and we also have programs that used to
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
exist and don't any longer so how could
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
we bring together our partners to really
 
02:30:03.269 --> 02:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
take a look at what we have and make
 
02:30:05.670 --> 02:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
things better so that we can a save
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
money because putting people in jail is
 
02:30:10.830 --> 02:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
really expensive uh B break the cycle so
 
02:30:13.230 --> 02:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
that kids are not just not committing
 
02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
crimes but also encouraging their peers
 
02:30:18.349 --> 02:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
not to commit them um and see you know
 
02:30:19.590 --> 02:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
maybe if we have more kids who are
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
invested in being involved in the
 
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
judicial system as young people maybe
 
02:30:25.230 --> 02:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
they'll learn much more and be
 
02:30:26.910 --> 02:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
contributing members of society in other
 
02:30:29.230 --> 02:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
ways and so that's where my my
 
02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
motivation for all of this came
 
02:30:34.070 --> 02:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
from thank
 
02:30:38.590 --> 02:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
you would you your your bill seems to uh
 
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
create a new
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
commission would or are you aware that
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
you can task an existing commission with
 
02:30:48.429 --> 02:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
legislation to to examine a new a new
 
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
issue so for example the inter Branch
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
commission that already has as its as
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
its role according to the information we
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
received from our researcher to look
 
02:30:58.030 --> 02:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
into these Juvenile Justice System
 
02:31:01.389 --> 02:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
issues you could say the interbranch um
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
commission is hereby tasked with abbc
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
and and study it um so I did not know
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
that but also I spoke to one of the
 
02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
people who works with that organization
 
02:31:15.510 --> 02:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
and uh with that commission and she was
 
02:31:17.190 --> 02:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
very focused on the fact that they have
 
02:31:20.349 --> 02:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
adult model programs that are working on
 
02:31:23.309 --> 02:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
teen issues and I said I asked her about
 
02:31:25.710 --> 02:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
the idea of having more of a teen
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
focused um more peer related and uh her
 
02:31:33.070 --> 02:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
response seemed to be um less than
 
02:31:36.269 --> 02:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about um looking at it from
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
a different lens and so my thought was
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
well if we can bring in Partners to talk
 
02:31:43.150 --> 02:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
about it maybe we can make the lens
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
wider to look for better
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
Solutions um I'm also on that commission
 
02:31:50.670 --> 02:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
and I would I would welcome a new task
 
02:31:53.150 --> 02:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we've met um so I
 
02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
I think that regardless of someone's
 
02:31:57.710 --> 02:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
interest in it or not if they're tasked
 
02:32:00.309 --> 02:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
with looking at a certain issue and
 
02:32:02.230 --> 02:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
discussing and bringing in a b and c
 
02:32:04.110 --> 02:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
then they have to it's it's the law so I
 
02:32:05.550 --> 02:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make you aware of that
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay versus creating a whole new
 
02:32:09.269 --> 02:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
commission that will go on in
 
02:32:11.269 --> 02:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
propertuity until whenever yeah this was
 
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
to be a a short-term study committee but
 
02:32:15.469 --> 02:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
I would be more than open to uh
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
modifying it to to test them with that
 
02:32:20.510 --> 02:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
as well or in instead any further
 
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
questions representa
 
02:32:24.990 --> 02:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
Muse just a quick question and I'm not
 
02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
sure if you can answer this or the chair
 
02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
but is this the same inter Branch
 
02:32:31.269 --> 02:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
commission that we've also potentially
 
02:32:33.950 --> 02:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
tasked with trying to better understand
 
02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
pre-trial diversion programs in the
 
02:32:38.190 --> 02:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
context of bail
 
02:32:40.309 --> 02:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
reform yes it
 
02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
is okay sounds like a lot of work thank
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
you if they get to work we sent them
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
which is still tile somewhere else U
 
02:32:47.680 --> 02:32:48.670 align:start position:0%
which is still tile somewhere else U
further

02:32:48.670 --> 02:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you and the
 
02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:53.269 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you and the
chair

02:32:53.269 --> 02:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:32:56.510 --> 02:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
recognizes um I'm sorry Mr CH I'm sorry
 
02:32:58.950 --> 02:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
um I did receive testimony from the ACLU
 
02:33:01.269 --> 02:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
in support um their representative was
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
here earlier but had a commitment at
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
this time and had to leave so she's
 
02:33:06.429 --> 02:33:06.439 align:start position:0%
distributed paper copies to everyone
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you we have it uh the chair AI is
 
02:33:08.640 --> 02:33:14.349 align:start position:0%
thank you we have it uh the chair AI is
representative

02:33:14.349 --> 02:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:17.630 --> 02:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
n thank you very much um for the record
 
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
my name is representative jod new and I
 
02:33:22.750 --> 02:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
represent chesher 4 over uh in Kean and
 
02:33:24.750 --> 02:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
I wanted to speak to this bill uh
 
02:33:27.269 --> 02:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
particularly as the mother of uh two
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
teenage boys um just before my son was
 
02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
going into high school um there was a a
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
a large concern um in an increase in all
 
02:33:38.510 --> 02:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of behaviors um and some of them
 
02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
were uh would fall under the behaviors
 
02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
that would be addressed in this
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
situation um I've since learned um about
 
02:33:46.870 --> 02:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know obious obviously the issue has
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
gotten better in the last 3 years um
 
02:33:52.190 --> 02:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
I've since learned also about um a
 
02:33:54.469 --> 02:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
community uh it is a restorative
 
02:33:56.510 --> 02:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
Community model that has been used and I
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
feel like that is pretty similar to this
 
02:34:00.590 --> 02:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
one unfortunately I didn't have the time
 
02:34:03.429 --> 02:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh I did not um reach out to the person
 
02:34:05.630 --> 02:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
who is leading that uh to bring them in
 
02:34:07.190 --> 02:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh in time for them to come and speak to
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
this but hopefully we we can get some
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
testimony on that what I was thinking is
 
02:34:12.830 --> 02:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
that um that would be a wonderful person
 
02:34:14.349 --> 02:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to contribute to the
 
02:34:15.910 --> 02:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
conversation if we were indeed to come
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
up with a uh form this study committee
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to speak to this as
 
02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
a mom of kids who sometimes do um very
 
02:34:25.429 --> 02:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
silly things and things that may be
 
02:34:27.830 --> 02:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
interpreted um in very negative ways as
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
a manifestation of um you know what we
 
02:34:33.070 --> 02:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
have also seen as a um Mental Health
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
crisis uh suicidal ideation is up
 
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
substance use is up and um I feel very
 
02:34:43.230 --> 02:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
much that a lot of these um um
 
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
concerning behaviors are also part of
 
02:34:48.110 --> 02:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
that that same issue and if we can uh
 
02:34:50.030 --> 02:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
come up with a better model to deal with
 
02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
that um and that actually addresses kind
 
02:34:54.670 --> 02:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
of behavior modification rather than
 
02:34:57.590 --> 02:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
criminalization or um punitive
 
02:34:58.990 --> 02:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
approaches I think that that would be a
 
02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
very good
 
02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
thing thank you
 
02:35:06.389 --> 02:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank
 
02:35:08.590 --> 02:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
you the chair
 
02:35:14.990 --> 02:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
jow

02:35:28.510 --> 02:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.349 --> 02:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
there we go hello members of the
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Lind Jake house and
 
02:35:34.990 --> 02:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
I am a co-founder of 603 equality and I
 
02:35:37.269 --> 02:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
strongly support this bill while I not
 
02:35:39.269 --> 02:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
an expert on restorative justice I know
 
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
that restorative justice is more
 
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
productive in resolving Community issues
 
02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
than punitive measures additionally
 
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
people must willingly participate in
 
02:35:49.950 --> 02:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
restorative justice practices for to
 
02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
work and the same restorative justice
 
02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
practices must apply to everyone to hold
 
02:35:56.349 --> 02:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
the entire Community accountable
 
02:35:58.429 --> 02:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
restorative justice practices can
 
02:36:01.469 --> 02:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
include uh things like facilitation
 
02:36:03.870 --> 02:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
between offender and victim peer
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
mediation and conflict resolution
 
02:36:08.750 --> 02:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
circles hosting dialogue circles and
 
02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
student integration following suspension
 
02:36:14.190 --> 02:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
for restorative justice to work students
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
must First Trust the process and if
 
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
successful it allows everyone within the
 
02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
community to be held accountable to each
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
other but that can only happen if people
 
02:36:26.030 --> 02:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
are not forced but participate willingly
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
in peer mediation Circle students who
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
may get into a fight for example talk it
 
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
out amongst each other in hopes of
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
intervening before the issue becomes an
 
02:36:36.630 --> 02:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
even bigger problem in dialogue circles
 
02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
students sit in larger circular shape
 
02:36:40.910 --> 02:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
facing each other to check in with each
 
02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
other settle disputes or perhaps even
 
02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
hold old academic intervention
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
um after student has done offense
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
restorative justice can allow for
 
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
integration through hosting circles with
 
02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
parents School administrators and the
 
02:36:59.389 --> 02:36:59.399 align:start position:0%
student to find a be best path forward
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
it has also been proven to prevent
 
02:37:03.150 --> 02:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
students from falling into the school to
 
02:37:05.870 --> 02:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
prison Pipeline and teachers Al also
 
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
benefit from restorative justice as it
 
02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
has been proven to improve the behavior
 
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
in the classroom dramatically I've also
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
had conversations with the assistant New
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Attorney General who has
 
02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
stressed that they want to work to stem
 
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
hate crimes and incidents committed by
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
juveniles before they may grow into
 
02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
something more harmful additionally I
 
02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
would encourage members of this
 
02:37:27.469 --> 02:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
committee through formal or informal
 
02:37:30.429 --> 02:37:30.439 align:start position:0%
need means to work with the members of
 
02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
the study committee on the following
 
02:37:34.510 --> 02:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
questions what are the origins of
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
reported restorative justice and what
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
constitutes true reproductive Justice
 
02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
and who is a qualified restorative
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
justice expert facilitator trainer or
 
02:37:47.150 --> 02:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
consultant in speaking with a parent of
 
02:37:48.910 --> 02:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
a high school student of color who is
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
also a member of the lgbtq community who
 
02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
experienced racial bullying and
 
02:37:54.990 --> 02:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
attempted to go through a restorative
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
justice process this parent stress that
 
02:37:59.469 --> 02:37:59.479 align:start position:0%
they have often seen restorative justice
 
02:38:01.870 --> 02:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
so-called experts who don't know the
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
origin of restorative justice Traditions
 
02:38:06.750 --> 02:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
who don't understand um the
 
02:38:09.309 --> 02:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
intersectional nature of this work and
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
who don't have the background on
 
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
systemic structures of Oppression um who
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
have traumatized students and
 
02:38:18.750 --> 02:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
restorative justice circles due to their
 
02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
own biases um basically some of these
 
02:38:23.389 --> 02:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
these folks do not have the proper
 
02:38:25.309 --> 02:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
skills and background and end up doing
 
02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
more harm than good many of us are
 
02:38:29.469 --> 02:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
learning and growing each day how to do
 
02:38:30.750 --> 02:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
better but I would hate to see a
 
02:38:32.830 --> 02:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
restorative justice program fail to
 
02:38:34.750 --> 02:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
serve the people who need it most
 
02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
because it is not structured in a way um
 
02:38:42.990 --> 02:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
that um fails to um stem additional
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
harms um so I would encourage um folks
 
02:38:51.550 --> 02:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
to move forward um with um ensuring that
 
02:38:54.030 --> 02:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh the study committee a Works to have

02:39:49.590 --> 02:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
1344 for the prime sponsor who is sick
 
02:39:54.750 --> 02:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
and cannot present it
 
02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:56.950 align:start position:0%
and cannot present it
today

02:39:56.950 --> 02:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:40:01.269 --> 02:40:01.279 align:start position:0%
um I submit to you today House Bill 1344
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
relative to criminalizing the enticement
 
02:40:06.349 --> 02:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
and manipulation of minors to engage in
 
02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
sexual activity this bill will amend RSA
 
02:40:14.389 --> 02:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
6393 and add language to RSA
 
02:40:17.469 --> 02:40:17.479 align:start position:0%
632-a um semicolon one to bring the
 
02:40:19.469 --> 02:40:19.479 align:start position:0%
enticement of children to include not
 
02:40:22.590 --> 02:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
only online but inperson solicitation
 
02:40:25.710 --> 02:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
and make it a crime as well I understand
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
that determining the attent is a
 
02:40:29.389 --> 02:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
challenge but there has been extensive
 
02:40:31.550 --> 02:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
studies to determine the outline of
 
02:40:34.230 --> 02:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
universally accepted model for the five
 
02:40:36.670 --> 02:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
stages of the process as published in a
 
02:40:38.910 --> 02:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
book by George winter
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
2022 federal statute might appear to be
 
02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
discussing sex trafficking yet case law
 
02:40:46.750 --> 02:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
determined that that travel is not
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
required if the minor is induced enticed
 
02:40:53.469 --> 02:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
or coerced into sexual activity this
 
02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
might lead to um prosecution without
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
actual State
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
legislation in addition to the federal
 
02:41:02.030 --> 02:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
statute there are 42 US states that have
 
02:41:04.349 --> 02:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
developed an anti-solicitation
 
02:41:07.469 --> 02:41:07.479 align:start position:0%
legislation but unfortunately many
 
02:41:09.790 --> 02:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire specify that the
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
enticement must involve the use of
 
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
electronic devices computer internet or
 
02:41:18.150 --> 02:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
text messaging meaning the law may not
 
02:41:21.150 --> 02:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
Encompass in-person sexual
 
02:41:23.630 --> 02:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
manipulation this type of behavior has
 
02:41:25.349 --> 02:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
been going on since the beginning of
 
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
time and it is never too late to step up
 
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
to protect children and make sure that
 
02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
our legislation addresses this Behavior
 
02:41:35.429 --> 02:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
fully and from every angle the these
 
02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
laws must be used as a tool to prevent
 
02:41:40.349 --> 02:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
child sexual abuse legislation
 
02:41:43.030 --> 02:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
preventing pre- abuse behaviors such as
 
02:41:46.110 --> 02:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
sexual enticement can stop the action
 
02:41:50.269 --> 02:41:50.279 align:start position:0%
prior to the actual abuse going forth
 
02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
sexual enticement both in person and
 
02:41:55.670 --> 02:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
online regardless of whether it results
 
02:41:58.510 --> 02:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
in a contact offense or the transmission
 
02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:01.640 align:start position:0%
of sexual abuse material needs to be
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
made into a crime onto itself to achieve
 
02:42:07.110 --> 02:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation needs to be clear and
 
02:42:09.150 --> 02:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
consistent across jurisdictions and
 
02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
based upon current research I offer this
 
02:42:14.670 --> 02:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
legislation as an additional step in the
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
right direction for the welfare of our
 
02:42:20.190 --> 02:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
children I offer chapters 16 and 17 of
 
02:42:22.590 --> 02:42:22.600 align:start position:0%

02:45:44.790 --> 02:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
have a broader opportunity to charge
 
02:45:46.750 --> 02:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
into individuals with sextortion related
 
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
crimes and thus have a direct impact on
 
02:45:50.790 --> 02:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
keeping children of New Hampshire safe
 
02:45:50.800 --> 02:45:52.389 align:start position:0%
keeping children of New Hampshire safe
thank

02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:45:55.630 --> 02:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony um have
 
02:45:58.070 --> 02:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
you had an opportunity to review this
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislation with one of the County
 
02:46:02.590 --> 02:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys and um if so have they given
 
02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
you any kind of an opinion on whether
 
02:46:05.950 --> 02:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
they thought it was worded correctly uh
 
02:46:08.630 --> 02:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
not directly no um you know my testimony
 
02:46:10.429 --> 02:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
is coming just purely with how we
 
02:46:12.710 --> 02:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
currently uh charge these crimes
 
02:46:14.190 --> 02:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
whenever we have a sex dation related
 
02:46:16.870 --> 02:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
crime we currently charge them under the
 
02:46:19.070 --> 02:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh the 649 statute there certain uses of
 
02:46:22.030 --> 02:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
Computer Services but as was stated
 
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
before sex ortion related crimes have
 
02:46:25.790 --> 02:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
becoming basically unfortunately these
 
02:46:27.910 --> 02:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
perpetrators have becoming very very
 
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
good at their tradecraft and they've
 
02:46:33.230 --> 02:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
expanded their ability to to uh
 
02:46:36.389 --> 02:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
perpetuate these crimes so if we had a
 
02:46:38.389 --> 02:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
sexor related crime that sort of Falls
 
02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
outside of it being done through a
 
02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
computer then it sort of handcuffs us if
 
02:46:45.230 --> 02:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
you excuse the pun with being able to
 
02:46:47.070 --> 02:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
you know charge someone like this
 
02:46:50.510 --> 02:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
expanding the language in a an
 
02:46:52.590 --> 02:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
environment where these crimes are being
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
perpetrated in newly creative ways
 
02:46:58.389 --> 02:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
expanding this language will give us a
 
02:47:00.309 --> 02:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
better opportunity to charge individuals
 
02:47:03.389 --> 02:47:03.399 align:start position:0%
in the future thank you and I I have
 
02:47:04.830 --> 02:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
full understanding how difficult it is
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
to bring one of those cases which is why
 
02:47:08.990 --> 02:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
I always want to make sure that the law
 
02:47:10.990 --> 02:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
as written would enable the prosecution
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
actually take the work you've done and
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
apply it in the court so I'll follow up
 
02:47:16.750 --> 02:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
with them thank you I appreciate any
 
02:47:19.469 --> 02:47:19.479 align:start position:0%
questions for detective representative
 
02:47:23.469 --> 02:47:23.479 align:start position:0%
um um s and then new thank you and thank
 
02:47:26.910 --> 02:47:26.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um in reading
 
02:47:29.429 --> 02:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
the bill it it talks about Prosecuting
 
02:47:31.630 --> 02:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
any person who engages someone under the
 
02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
age of 16 with a you know with with
 
02:47:38.950 --> 02:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
these acts um and I'm just trying to
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that I fully understand
 
02:47:43.269 --> 02:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
because it's not my area of expertise if
 
02:47:45.230 --> 02:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
if you had two 15-year-olds and engaging
 
02:47:47.429 --> 02:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
in mutually Mutual consent would they
 
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
then both be subject to prosecution if
 
02:47:52.830 --> 02:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
they're having mutually consensual touch
 
02:47:55.230 --> 02:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
of the nature described in this yeah
 
02:47:57.349 --> 02:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
because they'd be under the age of 15
 
02:47:58.950 --> 02:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
they would be under the age of 16 so if
 
02:48:01.349 --> 02:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
we had two you had two 15y olds you
 
02:48:03.670 --> 02:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
could I can tell you that from
 
02:48:06.830 --> 02:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
experience that we typically do not uh
 
02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
you know we iak faced we had over 2,000
 
02:48:14.990 --> 02:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
cases in 2022 alone or 2023 Alone um and
 
02:48:16.630 --> 02:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know those were some pretty serious
 
02:48:18.030 --> 02:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
cases whenever we have cases that
 
02:48:20.110 --> 02:48:20.120 align:start position:0%
involve juveniles it it it there's a
 
02:48:22.990 --> 02:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
whole another you know set of rules that
 
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
we have to play by
 
02:48:29.389 --> 02:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
so thank you y representative Newman I'm
 
02:48:30.910 --> 02:48:30.920 align:start position:0%

iak receives uh its cases uh through
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
what's called they're called cyber tips
 
02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
from the national Center for missing

02:49:06.590 --> 02:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
lumped into that
 
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
number generally there um all cases that
 
02:49:11.870 --> 02:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
involve abuse of children be it sexually
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%

03:06:11.910 --> 03:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
to take a recess but I had to go get the
 
03:06:14.710 --> 03:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
amendment which I thought was over at OS
 
03:06:17.229 --> 03:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
but actually was up on the fourth floor
 
03:06:21.990 --> 03:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
so if I look thinner that's why okay um

1500 though House Bill 1500 is not
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
perfect it is a step into unfamiliar
 
03:06:36.070 --> 03:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
territory that needs some definitions
 
03:06:39.030 --> 03:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
and penalties in place regarding
 
03:06:39.040 --> 03:06:40.550 align:start position:0%

Frontier Security Experts describe it as
 
03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
a serious Potential Threat where State
 
03:07:01.710 --> 03:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
lawmakers could play a vital role by
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
adopting Safeguard legislation that
 
03:07:08.030 --> 03:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
could be used as models for federal
 
03:07:09.950 --> 03:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
laws in
 
03:07:14.510 --> 03:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
2023 nearly 200 AI related bills were
 
03:07:18.229 --> 03:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
introduced in 31 state legislatures with

to privacy
 
03:07:29.790 --> 03:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
issues I believe the relevance of
 
03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
hb500 became obviously apparent this
 
03:07:37.389 --> 03:07:37.399 align:start position:0%
Monday when WMUR TV reported that the
 
03:07:39.950 --> 03:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Attorney General's office
 
03:07:43.309 --> 03:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
had handled numerous calls complaining
 
03:07:45.870 --> 03:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
about an artificially generated Robo
 
03:07:49.150 --> 03:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
call of President Joe Biden's voice
 
03:07:52.030 --> 03:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
telling voters their vote would not
 
03:07:56.030 --> 03:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
count on primary day but will count in
 
03:07:59.309 --> 03:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
November this was viewed as an unlawful
 
03:08:02.269 --> 03:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
attempt by a political committee to
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
disrupt the election the AG's office is
 
03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
now looking at it as a possible case of
 
03:08:09.040 --> 03:08:11.389 align:start position:0%
now looking at it as a possible case of
voter

03:08:11.389 --> 03:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
voter
 
03:08:14.830 --> 03:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
suppression Jeffrey hin who is the uh
 
03:08:16.950 --> 03:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
British Canadian computer
 
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
scientist and he's also a cognitive
 
03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
psychologist who's been deemed The
 
03:08:25.309 --> 03:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
Godfather of AI he
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
worried about the potential of AI to do
 
03:08:34.429 --> 03:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
harm so we can always amend
 
03:08:37.030 --> 03:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
legislation but it's difficult for
 
03:08:40.910 --> 03:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
people to ameliorate their lives when
 
03:08:43.550 --> 03:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
they have no laws to reference no
 
03:08:47.229 --> 03:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
defined recourse or penalties to utilize
 
03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
to help them gain back their
 
03:08:51.790 --> 03:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
lives so thank you for your
 
03:08:56.349 --> 03:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you could you just
 
03:09:02.190 --> 03:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
give us a brief um rundown in your
 
03:09:05.229 --> 03:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
estimation what this bill will do okay
 
03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
what it does is
 
03:09:10.150 --> 03:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
if synthetic media is going to be
 
03:09:13.150 --> 03:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
utilized whether it's in the political
 
03:09:16.070 --> 03:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
Arina or you know just on the Internet
 
03:09:19.389 --> 03:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
or whatever that it's has to be first of
 
03:09:22.750 --> 03:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
all the person who is involved say it's
 
03:09:26.870 --> 03:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
a disgruntled boyfriend with his ex and
 
03:09:30.429 --> 03:09:30.439 align:start position:0%
he puts on the media something negative
 
03:09:33.790 --> 03:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
either with her picture or her saying
 
03:09:36.510 --> 03:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
something that he can't do that unless
 
03:09:37.830 --> 03:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
he has her
 
03:09:40.510 --> 03:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
consent that's just you know for for the
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
general public um another piece of it is
 
03:09:47.150 --> 03:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be using AI you have
 
03:09:50.990 --> 03:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
to note if it's a video or whatever that
 
03:09:55.870 --> 03:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
it is AI is being used in this form and
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
so that the person who's viewing it
 
03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
knows that AI has some factor in what
 
03:10:03.710 --> 03:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
you are
 
03:10:07.830 --> 03:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
viewing the other thing is um with the
 
03:10:11.950 --> 03:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
election piece of it as we so vividly
 
03:10:14.429 --> 03:10:14.439 align:start position:0%
found out on day it's happening right
 
03:10:18.190 --> 03:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
here so the feds are looking to the
 
03:10:20.990 --> 03:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
states to be the ones to move the bar
 
03:10:23.990 --> 03:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
here and of course you know we're we
 
03:10:26.229 --> 03:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
could always be behind the bar because
 
03:10:29.469 --> 03:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
AI is so far ahead of us but at least
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's a step so that if somebody finds
 
03:10:38.110 --> 03:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
thems a victim of AI um as far as media
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
whatever then they at least know there
 
03:10:45.110 --> 03:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:47.630 --> 03:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
with regard to personal individuals
 
03:10:51.150 --> 03:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
would this Encompass um for for example
 
03:10:54.349 --> 03:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
um we're hearing a lot about um people
 
03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
taking someone's head and putting it on
 
03:10:58.630 --> 03:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
a nude body and portraying that as that
 
03:11:00.750 --> 03:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
person or any other number of false
 
03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
portrayals of people where they been
 
03:11:05.990 --> 03:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
manipulated by AI MH yes thank you
 
03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative rhods thank you Mr
 
03:11:12.110 --> 03:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
chairman could you explain how how this
 
03:11:14.269 --> 03:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
would be a B to be enforced with with
 
03:11:16.429 --> 03:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
Commerce if a person lives in a a
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
different state and there and you know
 
03:11:19.190 --> 03:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
especially with social media because it
 
03:11:21.190 --> 03:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
sounded like you you had mentioned that
 
03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
a lot and I'm just curious how we would
 
03:11:26.429 --> 03:11:26.439 align:start position:0%
enforce that so you're asking if it had
 
03:11:28.870 --> 03:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
to do with somebody in another state as
 
03:11:31.150 --> 03:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
the perpetrator or the
 
03:11:33.990 --> 03:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
victim perpetrator I would be good to
 
03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
start I I think I think this is more
 
03:11:38.790 --> 03:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
designed for the
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
victim as far as they have a recourse of
 
03:11:47.469 --> 03:11:47.479 align:start position:0%
what they can do um a person that has
 
03:11:50.830 --> 03:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
the um ability to utilize another
 
03:11:54.150 --> 03:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
person's image um they will it would be
 
03:11:56.790 --> 03:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
called if they are convicted it would be
 
03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
a Class A misdemeanor which would be up
 
03:12:02.670 --> 03:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
to 12 months in jail or 2,000 up to
 
03:12:02.680 --> 03:12:05.429 align:start position:0%
to 12 months in jail or 2,000 up to
$2,000

03:12:05.429 --> 03:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
$2,000
 
03:12:08.269 --> 03:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
fine thank you further
 
03:12:11.389 --> 03:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
questions see represent
 
03:12:14.030 --> 03:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um do you have
 
03:12:18.190 --> 03:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
any concerns about potential Free Speech
 
03:12:19.710 --> 03:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
violations considering there's no
 
03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
exception for irony or sarcasm in this
 
03:12:25.870 --> 03:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
bill and also potentially an overly
 
03:12:29.469 --> 03:12:29.479 align:start position:0%
broad definition um with this amendment
 
03:12:33.630 --> 03:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
um on computer editing of photographs
 
03:12:35.190 --> 03:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
almost anything that's going to be put
 
03:12:38.309 --> 03:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
online would be edited on a
 
03:12:42.269 --> 03:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
computer um as far as the concern goes I
 
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
think that the Free Speech has more to
 
03:12:49.790 --> 03:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
do with
 
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
um are you talking about specifically
 
03:12:53.990 --> 03:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
Free Speech or are you talking about the
 
03:12:57.309 --> 03:12:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:00.190 --> 03:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
image um both but if you want to uh
 
03:13:03.510 --> 03:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
address the Free Speech concern first
 
03:13:07.070 --> 03:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
well again if the I AI was being used it
 
03:13:09.910 --> 03:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
would have to be noted somewhere visibly
 
03:13:13.910 --> 03:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
or AUD audibly um so therefore that part
 
03:13:17.309 --> 03:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
of it would be notified first for the
 
03:13:20.870 --> 03:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:25.750 --> 03:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:28.510 --> 03:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
um I guess you know even if it's noted
 
03:13:29.910 --> 03:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
it said it would still need to be done
 
03:13:33.830 --> 03:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
with the consent of the person right
 
03:13:37.830 --> 03:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay um and then with the um editing
 
03:13:39.750 --> 03:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
images part with the definition as you
 
03:13:43.309 --> 03:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
expanded it in the amendment um
 
03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
um I have someone who will be speaking
 
03:13:49.429 --> 03:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
to the amendment so um you can ask them
 
03:13:52.750 --> 03:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
okay repres Manion thank you Mr chair
 
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
03:13:58.750 --> 03:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
I know people who make memes especially
 
03:14:00.910 --> 03:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
political ones they post on Twitter and
 
03:14:04.830 --> 03:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
whatnot um if I were to reshare that
 
03:14:06.110 --> 03:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
without knowing that they don't have
 
03:14:08.309 --> 03:14:08.319 align:start position:0%
consent of the person would I now be in
 
03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
violation of this
 
03:14:12.590 --> 03:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
law you know that's a good question and
 
03:14:15.269 --> 03:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
and um I think it would have to do with
 
03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
intent I intentionally share re
 
03:14:19.990 --> 03:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
retweeted it or res shared it not
 
03:14:21.389 --> 03:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
knowing but I
 
03:14:23.030 --> 03:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
intentionally I think the question of
 
03:14:25.550 --> 03:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
intent is was your intent to share an
 
03:14:26.950 --> 03:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
edited False
 
03:14:30.429 --> 03:14:30.439 align:start position:0%
Image knowing that it wasn't right
 
03:14:33.150 --> 03:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
legally obtained or created perhaps
 
03:14:34.910 --> 03:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
right but I would know that and I guess
 
03:14:37.070 --> 03:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
my question if I can clarify it is a lot
 
03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
of these memes are clearly of a
 
03:14:40.269 --> 03:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
different body with a political
 
03:14:41.830 --> 03:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
candidate's face on it with something
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
funny said on top and bottom I clearly
 
03:14:45.670 --> 03:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
know it's not that person's body it's a
 
03:14:48.630 --> 03:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
cartoon or whatever and I reshare that
 
03:14:51.070 --> 03:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
online would I now be in violation of
 
03:14:51.080 --> 03:14:51.910 align:start position:0%
online would I now be in violation of
this

03:14:51.910 --> 03:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:14:55.910 --> 03:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
law if would to pass um again I I I
 
03:14:57.990 --> 03:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
don't know it would have to do an intent
 
03:15:00.950 --> 03:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
I believe thank
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:09.750 --> 03:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
Muse your your bill is uh is is very
 
03:15:12.590 --> 03:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
broad um and it it doesn't appear to
 
03:15:15.870 --> 03:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
identify uh distribution so one of the
 
03:15:20.830 --> 03:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
questions that I have is would uh a
 
03:15:23.950 --> 03:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
party involved in the wider distribution
 
03:15:28.189 --> 03:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
of this media um also be guilty of of a
 
03:15:32.429 --> 03:15:32.439 align:start position:0%
crime so for example if WMUR winds up
 
03:15:37.309 --> 03:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
running an advertisement um that uses uh
 
03:15:39.670 --> 03:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
synthetic media improperly but that
 
03:15:42.710 --> 03:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
information isn't disclosed to WM R
 
03:15:42.720 --> 03:15:43.830 align:start position:0%
information isn't disclosed to WM R
would

03:15:43.830 --> 03:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:15:47.349 --> 03:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
W um also be subject to a
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
penalty that that's a very good question
 
03:15:51.990 --> 03:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
and to be honest with you I hadn't
 
03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
factored that in so that may be
 
03:15:56.269 --> 03:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be worked on
 
03:15:58.510 --> 03:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:16:02.670 --> 03:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:16:05.510 --> 03:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question under Section Five
 
03:16:07.349 --> 03:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
item two can you give me an example of
 
03:16:09.309 --> 03:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
what you envision that would be an
 
03:16:11.309 --> 03:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
example of that that would be
 
03:16:14.830 --> 03:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
enforced section five item two section
 
03:16:20.710 --> 03:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:22.870 --> 03:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
yeah a person is convicted of an
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
election related misleading synthetic
 
03:16:26.830 --> 03:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
media based on a complaint that alleges
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
that the actor distributed the election
 
03:16:30.790 --> 03:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
related misleading synthetic media with
 
03:16:33.429 --> 03:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
a further purpose to provoke
 
03:16:36.150 --> 03:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
violence um I I'll be very honest with
 
03:16:37.870 --> 03:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
you I have someone here can speak to
 
03:16:40.389 --> 03:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
that better I'd be willing to hear okay
 
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
03:16:44.309 --> 03:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you for
 
03:16:48.910 --> 03:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
the introdution you and with that I
 
03:17:01.590 --> 03:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:04.189 --> 03:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you chairman Roy I'm
 
03:17:06.950 --> 03:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative Tom Corman from Grafton
 
03:17:09.510 --> 03:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
15 which is Ward three of the city of
 
03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
Lebanon I have been in computer science
 
03:17:15.910 --> 03:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
for for literally 50 years I started in
 
03:17:18.830 --> 03:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
1974 I have computer science degrees
 
03:17:21.990 --> 03:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
from Princeton and MIT I was a professor
 
03:17:24.469 --> 03:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
of computer science at Dartmouth for 29
 
03:17:27.790 --> 03:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
and a half years my research is not in
 
03:17:31.790 --> 03:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence it never was but
 
03:17:34.070 --> 03:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
as a practicing computer scientist and
 
03:17:36.309 --> 03:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
somebody who had to keep track of the
 
03:17:38.910 --> 03:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
broad field I certainly kept track of
 
03:17:41.189 --> 03:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
what was going on in artificial
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
intelligence for at least the last 40
 
03:17:47.710 --> 03:17:47.720 align:start position:0%
years I've seen the amazing progress
 
03:17:50.670 --> 03:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
that AI has made 40 years ago AI seemed
 
03:17:53.469 --> 03:17:53.479 align:start position:0%
dead in the water people were making fun
 
03:17:56.750 --> 03:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
of neural Nets and then a few years ago
 
03:18:00.030 --> 03:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
things changed neural Nets became quite
 
03:18:01.710 --> 03:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
capable as people realized how to
 
03:18:03.710 --> 03:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
construct them and we're seeing the
 
03:18:05.429 --> 03:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
results now in
 
03:18:08.950 --> 03:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
AI I always hesitate to use the term
 
03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
exponential because I'm a quantitative
 
03:18:14.710 --> 03:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
person and I know exponential means but
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
it seems like we are having literally
 
03:18:19.710 --> 03:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
exponential growth in
 
03:18:24.389 --> 03:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
AI what we have now is a situation where
 
03:18:27.150 --> 03:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
it's so easy to create deep fakes it
 
03:18:29.309 --> 03:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
would not be hard to create a video of
 
03:18:32.389 --> 03:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy talking about how much he
 
03:18:35.349 --> 03:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
admires Bernie
 
03:18:38.750 --> 03:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
Sanders that that video actually exists
 
03:18:38.760 --> 03:18:41.110 align:start position:0%
Sanders that that video actually exists
okay

03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:18:41.120 --> 03:18:46.550 align:start position:0%
okay
well

03:18:46.550 --> 03:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:49.950 --> 03:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm very concerned about what misuse
 
03:18:54.469 --> 03:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
of AI can happen um and it's only going
 
03:18:56.990 --> 03:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
to get worse right I mean we think of
 
03:18:59.349 --> 03:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
what we have now it's continuing and
 
03:19:02.429 --> 03:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
it's only going to get worse the the the
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
the potential for abuse it's just going
 
03:19:04.640 --> 03:19:06.070 align:start position:0%
the potential for abuse it's just going
to

03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:19:09.550 --> 03:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
increase this bill uh I think actually
 
03:19:12.630 --> 03:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
has some of the guard rails that some of
 
03:19:14.189 --> 03:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
the committee members were just asking
 
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
about so for example somebody just asked
 
03:19:18.950 --> 03:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
about what if um somebody uh produced a
 
03:19:21.070 --> 03:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
deep fake video a malicious deep fake
 
03:19:25.309 --> 03:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
video and WMUR ran it well if you look
 
03:19:29.710 --> 03:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
at line 13 of page one of the bill uh
 
03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
with the intent of misleading others
 
03:19:32.950 --> 03:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
about the acts of the identifiable
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
person presumably WMUR is not intending
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
to be misleading they or or trying to
 
03:19:41.710 --> 03:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
defame anyone they're just running the
 
03:19:44.950 --> 03:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
video so I I I think that the broadly
 
03:19:47.309 --> 03:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is is in the right place there
 
03:19:49.389 --> 03:19:49.399 align:start position:0%
might be some changes you might want to
 
03:19:52.349 --> 03:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
make to it to uh narrow the scope of the
 
03:19:55.030 --> 03:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
bill but I do believe it's really in the
 
03:19:57.469 --> 03:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
right place here trying
 
03:20:01.349 --> 03:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
to guard against a lot of the abuse that
 
03:20:03.309 --> 03:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to see and of course as as
 
03:20:04.990 --> 03:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsor pointed out and as you all
 
03:20:09.670 --> 03:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
know it hit New Hampshire two days ago
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take
 
03:20:10.960 --> 03:20:15.269 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take
questions

03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:15.279 --> 03:20:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:20:16.870 --> 03:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:20:19.550 --> 03:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
sake thank you Mr chair I'm sorry I I
 
03:20:21.750 --> 03:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
just am trying to wrap my head around
 
03:20:23.550 --> 03:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
all the different components of this
 
03:20:26.309 --> 03:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
bill so I have a a kiddo who takes
 
03:20:28.349 --> 03:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
photos at sporting events at school and
 
03:20:31.309 --> 03:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
then uses various software editing
 
03:20:34.590 --> 03:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
programs to improve those photos before
 
03:20:36.469 --> 03:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
very deliberately Distributing them both
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
to members of the team and to social
 
03:20:42.229 --> 03:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
media on behalf of the various teams and
 
03:20:44.790 --> 03:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
it feels like that would be at risk
 
03:20:47.229 --> 03:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
within this statute given the broadness
 
03:20:49.910 --> 03:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the language right of because she's
 
03:20:52.630 --> 03:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
deliberately using software programming
 
03:20:56.550 --> 03:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
that has an artificial ability to M edit
 
03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
the photos um and so I just I'm trying
 
03:21:02.590 --> 03:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
to understand how that plays out into
 
03:21:04.429 --> 03:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
this maybe you could help help me
 
03:21:06.510 --> 03:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
understand myself better sure thank you
 
03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative Cel uh well one thing is
 
03:21:12.070 --> 03:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
that the bill specifically says through
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
the use of artificial intelligence
 
03:21:17.790 --> 03:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
algorithms and many of the algorithms
 
03:21:20.550 --> 03:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
that you would see in video or or uh
 
03:21:22.389 --> 03:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
especially just uh image editing
 
03:21:25.389 --> 03:21:25.399 align:start position:0%
software are NE not necessarily uh would
 
03:21:28.510 --> 03:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
would be classified as AI algorithms um
 
03:21:32.269 --> 03:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
so so there's that and then um just in
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
terms of misleading others about the
 
03:21:37.790 --> 03:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
acts of the identifiable person uh you
 
03:21:40.950 --> 03:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
know if it I think there it depends on
 
03:21:43.269 --> 03:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
on on what your what your child intends
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
to do right so if your child's trying to
 
03:21:47.950 --> 03:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
show one of their teammates chopping off
 
03:21:49.950 --> 03:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
the head of somebody on the other team
 
03:21:51.910 --> 03:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that would probably be a bad thing
 
03:21:53.990 --> 03:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
to do but if they're just trying to show
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
that the the person was doing something
 
03:21:59.550 --> 03:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
you know good then I don't think that
 
03:22:02.030 --> 03:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:06.469 --> 03:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
problem further questions representative
 
03:22:09.389 --> 03:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
Muse I I know you're a computer science
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
expert and not a First Amendment expert
 
03:22:14.309 --> 03:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
um um but one of the things I'd like to
 
03:22:16.870 --> 03:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
ask you about is do you think that there
 
03:22:20.510 --> 03:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
are um appropriate uses of of this
 
03:22:22.469 --> 03:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
technology and specifically when it
 
03:22:26.910 --> 03:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
comes to the ability to
 
03:22:29.590 --> 03:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
um change somebody's facial appearance
 
03:22:31.349 --> 03:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
so they appear to be somebody else and
 
03:22:34.030 --> 03:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking specifically of things uh
 
03:22:34.040 --> 03:22:35.750 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking specifically of things uh
like

03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:22:38.950 --> 03:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
parody I'm sorry like what like parody
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
oh parody
 
03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:43.349 align:start position:0%
oh parody
yeah

03:22:43.349 --> 03:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:22:46.710 --> 03:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
um you I I I think if there's one thing
 
03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
missing from this bill it's it's
 
03:22:52.670 --> 03:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
specifically stated intent that that
 
03:22:54.550 --> 03:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
that there should be something malicious
 
03:22:55.790 --> 03:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
or or
 
03:22:58.670 --> 03:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
defamatory behind it um I actually have
 
03:23:02.870 --> 03:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
a bill uh in Edna that would limit what
 
03:23:06.110 --> 03:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
state agencies can do with AI and there
 
03:23:09.309 --> 03:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
it it specifically says malicious or or
 
03:23:11.830 --> 03:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
defamatory so that might be something
 
03:23:13.469 --> 03:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
that that the committee might wish to
 
03:23:15.309 --> 03:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
amend the bill to
 
03:23:18.710 --> 03:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
include um I can certainly
 
03:23:21.870 --> 03:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
imagine good uses of deep fakes and you
 
03:23:23.150 --> 03:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
know when I was thinking about the bill
 
03:23:25.469 --> 03:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
that I did submit I was thinking you
 
03:23:28.670 --> 03:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
know an obvious deep fake would be You
 
03:23:30.830 --> 03:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
Know Abe Lincoln talking about forest
 
03:23:32.870 --> 03:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
fires right it it would be possible to
 
03:23:35.710 --> 03:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
do that and I don't think anybody would
 
03:23:37.630 --> 03:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
say oh this is just a horrible thing to
 
03:23:39.550 --> 03:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
do Abe Lincoln would never talk about
 
03:23:41.670 --> 03:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
forest fires and also there was never
 
03:23:43.269 --> 03:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
video taken of Abe Lincoln yeah I think
 
03:23:47.070 --> 03:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:49.910 --> 03:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
that further questions representative
 
03:23:52.309 --> 03:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I I just have a quick
 
03:23:54.429 --> 03:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
question about line 11 that says without
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
displaying a cons they'd be guilty
 
03:23:59.870 --> 03:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
without displaying a conspicuous notice
 
03:24:02.309 --> 03:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
within the synthetic media identifying
 
03:24:06.070 --> 03:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
it as synthetic media so if if I was
 
03:24:08.110 --> 03:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
creating this media and without the
 
03:24:09.670 --> 03:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
consent of the individual that was
 
03:24:11.830 --> 03:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
involved but on all my media I put a
 
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
little comment down this says synthetic
 
03:24:16.830 --> 03:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
media would I then be okay with this
 
03:24:21.150 --> 03:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:26.710 --> 03:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
it so my answer to that is that as long
 
03:24:29.910 --> 03:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
as the synthetic media really is clearly
 
03:24:32.309 --> 03:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
labeled as such if you know if a video
 
03:24:35.269 --> 03:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
says this was produced by AI or
 
03:24:37.750 --> 03:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
something similar to that if an image
 
03:24:40.830 --> 03:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
said that if the rooc calls that came in
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
two days ago
 
03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
actually said this this is a uh
 
03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
reconstruction of of President
 
03:24:53.710 --> 03:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
Biden as long as the person who is
 
03:24:56.670 --> 03:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
viewing or hearing or experiencing the
 
03:24:59.070 --> 03:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
media understands that it was produced
 
03:25:01.710 --> 03:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
by AI
 
03:25:05.469 --> 03:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
then if they're deceived it's on
 
03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
them thank you thank you I would just
 
03:25:10.070 --> 03:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
remind the committee as Witnesses come
 
03:25:11.870 --> 03:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
up we do have uh one of the County
 
03:25:13.590 --> 03:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys who's going to testify at the
 
03:25:16.110 --> 03:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
end uh try and save your legal questions
 
03:25:21.070 --> 03:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:24.309 --> 03:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
Balden thanks for taking my question as
 
03:25:26.990 --> 03:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the bill language um and
 
03:25:28.510 --> 03:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony I'm reminded
 
03:25:32.429 --> 03:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
of a couple things um I remember when um
 
03:25:34.229 --> 03:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
when we have in the past tried to deal
 
03:25:36.670 --> 03:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
with robocalling from a technical
 
03:25:38.229 --> 03:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
perspective from a legal
 
03:25:40.510 --> 03:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
perspective um and the particularly the
 
03:25:43.510 --> 03:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
issue of like spoofing a phone number
 
03:25:46.830 --> 03:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
that some of the drawbacks to Banning
 
03:25:48.630 --> 03:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
spoofing phone numbers was that if there
 
03:25:52.070 --> 03:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
was a cause for spoofing a number like a
 
03:25:54.870 --> 03:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable purpose like um calling out
 
03:25:56.429 --> 03:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
from maybe you're working from home
 
03:25:57.510 --> 03:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
you're a nurse you need to call a
 
03:25:59.870 --> 03:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
patient to reschedule something but it's
 
03:26:01.830 --> 03:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
covid or it's snowed so you're working
 
03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
from home you want to be able to spoof
 
03:26:06.150 --> 03:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
the number to call from the office so
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
that you're not giving out your personal
 
03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
number um and I'm also reminded of like
 
03:26:13.790 --> 03:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
um those commercial on the radio for car
 
03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
dealerships where it's definitely like
 
03:26:18.590 --> 03:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
people mocking the voices of notable
 
03:26:18.600 --> 03:26:19.950 align:start position:0%
people mocking the voices of notable
people

03:26:19.950 --> 03:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:26:23.309 --> 03:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
presidents um so my question is in those
 
03:26:25.189 --> 03:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
situations um thinking about how there
 
03:26:28.590 --> 03:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
may be useful reasons to mislead people
 
03:26:31.229 --> 03:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
and how there may be beneficial ways for
 
03:26:32.910 --> 03:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
businesses to mislead people and
 
03:26:35.189 --> 03:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
considering that we already require a
 
03:26:38.309 --> 03:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
paid for by disclaimer and we can
 
03:26:41.030 --> 03:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
already prosecute people who mislead the
 
03:26:44.389 --> 03:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
public about election law um considering
 
03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
how they're investigating this how does
 
03:26:50.070 --> 03:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation as it's worded play
 
03:26:52.590 --> 03:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
into all of those situations are we
 
03:26:55.229 --> 03:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
going to limit not that I would mind
 
03:26:56.750 --> 03:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
never hearing one of those car
 
03:26:59.110 --> 03:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
commercials again but how would it
 
03:27:03.269 --> 03:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
affect that in your opinion thank you in
 
03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
terms of spoofing phone numbers I don't
 
03:27:09.229 --> 03:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
see that as gerine to this particular
 
03:27:12.510 --> 03:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
bill um I see that is
 
03:27:16.269 --> 03:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
as not really about synthetic media um
 
03:27:18.229 --> 03:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
so I I wouldn't view that I think is
 
03:27:20.030 --> 03:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
using that as an example of how
 
03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
technology can be used yeah yeah but
 
03:27:24.990 --> 03:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
just in terms of of that specific
 
03:27:26.830 --> 03:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
question I I don't think it's Germaine
 
03:27:29.110 --> 03:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
to this particular
 
03:27:32.469 --> 03:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
Bill uh yeah so I I don't know which car
 
03:27:34.750 --> 03:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
commercials I haven't heard any car
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
commercials with um SPO of famous voices
 
03:27:41.510 --> 03:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
or anything like that um I think I think
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
what I would say there is
 
03:27:46.750 --> 03:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah they probably should be saying
 
03:27:50.670 --> 03:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
that it's not the actual person just to
 
03:27:53.630 --> 03:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
be very clear about it unless it's just
 
03:27:56.429 --> 03:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
I think really really obvious that it
 
03:27:59.070 --> 03:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't be the actual person for
 
03:28:01.229 --> 03:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
example if they had uh if there was a
 
03:28:03.750 --> 03:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
car commercial with somebody doing an
 
03:28:06.349 --> 03:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
imitation of John F Kennedy our
 
03:28:08.070 --> 03:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
president the former president that John
 
03:28:12.110 --> 03:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
F Kennedy um advertising for Chevy
 
03:28:14.990 --> 03:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
Tahoe I think we all know that that's
 
03:28:17.269 --> 03:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
not really JFK advertising for a Chevy
 
03:28:19.469 --> 03:28:19.479 align:start position:0%
Tahoe but I I I would say you know in my
 
03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
opinion and it's just my opinion if
 
03:28:24.670 --> 03:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
there's any doubt as to whether this is
 
03:28:28.950 --> 03:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:31.469 --> 03:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
clear see no further questions thank you
 
03:28:32.429 --> 03:28:32.439 align:start position:0%
for your
 
03:28:34.710 --> 03:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
testimony here calls representative
 
03:28:34.720 --> 03:28:39.950 align:start position:0%
testimony here calls representative
Jonah

03:28:39.950 --> 03:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:41.910 --> 03:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you you Mr chairman
 
03:28:44.150 --> 03:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it's a little
 
03:28:46.150 --> 03:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
scary being on this side of the Das I'd
 
03:28:48.189 --> 03:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
have to say it's a little bit different
 
03:28:50.510 --> 03:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
but um I just have to affirm my support
 
03:28:53.870 --> 03:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
for representative milla's Bill I'm very
 
03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
concerned with the rise of artificial
 
03:28:58.990 --> 03:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
intelligence in our world today I think
 
03:29:00.870 --> 03:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
as you know we've gotten to talk about
 
03:29:03.189 --> 03:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes to should we allow kids
 
03:29:05.429 --> 03:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
and and civil not kids but civilians to
 
03:29:07.229 --> 03:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
be able to own these these weapons and
 
03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
the military drone capabilities that uh
 
03:29:12.269 --> 03:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligent
 
03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh operating systems open up for our
 
03:29:16.830 --> 03:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
world but I think another big concern
 
03:29:19.750 --> 03:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
with artificial intelligence is the uh
 
03:29:21.309 --> 03:29:21.319 align:start position:0%
ability that it has to mislead the
 
03:29:24.309 --> 03:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
public and and misrepresentations of
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
famous politicians famous uh people
 
03:29:30.030 --> 03:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
different events I mean um the
 
03:29:32.429 --> 03:29:32.439 align:start position:0%
possibilities are kind of endless with
 
03:29:34.189 --> 03:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence and and what it
 
03:29:36.910 --> 03:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
can be used for in this way and and I
 
03:29:39.150 --> 03:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
think that's a concerning thing so I I
 
03:29:41.150 --> 03:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
think as representative Mamilla said you
 
03:29:43.189 --> 03:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily
 
03:29:45.790 --> 03:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh and it was brought up in the last AI
 
03:29:47.750 --> 03:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
hearing that we had to in regards to
 
03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
weapons addressing this is going to be a
 
03:29:51.950 --> 03:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
hard thing for the legislature to do
 
03:29:54.349 --> 03:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
when the technology is growing at such
 
03:29:57.790 --> 03:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
an uh fast rate the acceleration of the
 
03:30:01.469 --> 03:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
the rate of uh production and and how
 
03:30:03.550 --> 03:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
how much research goes into it and and
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
the capabilities of the technology
 
03:30:07.710 --> 03:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
doubles like every four months or
 
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
something like that um It's A Hard rate
 
03:30:11.910 --> 03:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
to keep up with but I think instead of
 
03:30:14.910 --> 03:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
not addressing it at all um it's more
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
incumbent on us to treat AI as the hair
 
03:30:19.950 --> 03:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
and us as the tortoise where you know
 
03:30:21.630 --> 03:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
yes the hair might be you know
 
03:30:23.389 --> 03:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
significantly farther ahead of us but we
 
03:30:25.550 --> 03:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
need to still be walking and dealing
 
03:30:28.830 --> 03:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
with these issues as much as we can um
 
03:30:30.950 --> 03:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
because of the serious effects that they
 
03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
that they can have I mean the rooc call
 
03:30:35.150 --> 03:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
thankfully didn't result in in all these
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
people not voting for The riding
 
03:30:37.870 --> 03:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
campaign although as someone who didn't
 
03:30:39.269 --> 03:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
support the writing campaign maybe that
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been such a bad thing but
 
03:30:44.670 --> 03:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
I think it is concerning if we ever have
 
03:30:47.269 --> 03:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
a an event in which
 
03:30:49.189 --> 03:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
um if we're talking about the
 
03:30:51.870 --> 03:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
presidential campaign next year someone
 
03:30:54.510 --> 03:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
can blast out onto social media some
 
03:30:56.990 --> 03:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
video of President Biden or or president
 
03:30:58.590 --> 03:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
Trump saying something completely
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
ridiculous but not so ridiculous that
 
03:31:03.309 --> 03:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
it's unbelievable and then a sector of
 
03:31:05.830 --> 03:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
the population of the electorate that's
 
03:31:07.750 --> 03:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
just scrolling through on Facebook sees
 
03:31:09.990 --> 03:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
this video it's 30 seconds long and it's
 
03:31:12.189 --> 03:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
telling them don't vote the election's
 
03:31:13.670 --> 03:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
actually on Wednesday we changed it to
 
03:31:15.269 --> 03:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
Wednesday there's going to be a
 
03:31:16.830 --> 03:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
significant chunk of people
 
03:31:19.469 --> 03:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that make the decision to
 
03:31:21.870 --> 03:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
vote on Wednesday and and we we did see
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
this in 2016 there were people who were
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
texted and said hey you can vote via
 
03:31:29.150 --> 03:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
text and those people voted via text
 
03:31:31.269 --> 03:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
voted via text and and their vote didn't
 
03:31:34.189 --> 03:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
count um so and that's not artificial
 
03:31:36.389 --> 03:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
intelligence that's just how people use
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
media and different narratives to
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
mislead the public so giving people this
 
03:31:43.229 --> 03:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
tool now artificial intelligence the the
 
03:31:45.550 --> 03:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
powers that be have this tool now and
 
03:31:47.870 --> 03:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be used in in some very
 
03:31:50.269 --> 03:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
significant ways and the electoral
 
03:31:53.150 --> 03:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
process and in business and all these
 
03:31:56.429 --> 03:31:56.439 align:start position:0%
other things and I think th um there are
 
03:31:58.510 --> 03:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
valid concerns for Free Speech but I
 
03:32:01.070 --> 03:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
think there also should be a concern for
 
03:32:03.229 --> 03:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
the basic fundamental foundation of the
 
03:32:06.189 --> 03:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
truth where we can't have an election we
 
03:32:08.389 --> 03:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
can't have a free and fair election we
 
03:32:10.110 --> 03:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
can't have a free and fair process or
 
03:32:12.309 --> 03:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
deliberative process process if there's
 
03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
not some baseline of truth that we can
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
be able to operate from and I think the
 
03:32:20.510 --> 03:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
danger with AI is it threatens the very
 
03:32:22.349 --> 03:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
sanctity of that Foundation of Truth
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
which is already very fragile right now
 
03:32:25.990 --> 03:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
I think in this moment in this country
 
03:32:27.750 --> 03:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
and the more that there are these
 
03:32:32.429 --> 03:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
synthetic audio video uh platforms out
 
03:32:34.189 --> 03:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
there that people can create things that
 
03:32:36.189 --> 03:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
totally mislead the population and I
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
think that the more we risk uh losing
 
03:32:41.070 --> 03:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
that basic Foundation of Truth to be
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
able to then have uh these conversations
 
03:32:46.389 --> 03:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm a I'm a respector of free speech
 
03:32:48.550 --> 03:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
I want to I want to protect the First
 
03:32:50.870 --> 03:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment um but I also want to make
 
03:32:52.950 --> 03:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we can have those discussions
 
03:32:54.469 --> 03:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
so the First Amendment means something
 
03:32:55.870 --> 03:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
and then the final thing I'd say is to
 
03:32:57.550 --> 03:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
representative balens point to answer
 
03:32:59.150 --> 03:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
your question I have seen those
 
03:33:01.910 --> 03:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
presidential commercials I know you know
 
03:33:03.150 --> 03:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
the president State commercial where
 
03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
they try to get Lincoln to sell you a
 
03:33:05.910 --> 03:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
Chevy or something like that you I've
 
03:33:08.309 --> 03:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
seen that um but I would agree with
 
03:33:09.950 --> 03:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative Corman that I don't think
 
03:33:11.910 --> 03:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
that really Falls under artificial
 
03:33:15.469 --> 03:33:15.479 align:start position:0%
intelligence or uh any of the other uh I
 
03:33:17.110 --> 03:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's necessarily Germaine
 
03:33:19.429 --> 03:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
to what we're discussing here because um
 
03:33:20.630 --> 03:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about artificial
 
03:33:21.990 --> 03:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
intelligence and and that very
 
03:33:23.670 --> 03:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
specifically even when representative
 
03:33:25.990 --> 03:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
Muse brought up um in his testimony
 
03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
related to his bill uh the the example
 
03:33:30.590 --> 03:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
of someone being able to use the face
 
03:33:32.389 --> 03:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
app that you were using when you were in
 
03:33:34.670 --> 03:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
business um you know those are those are
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's not necessarily what we're
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
discussing here we're talking about sort
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
of art legitimately artificial
 
03:33:43.510 --> 03:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
intelligent algorithms that will be able
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
to to manipulate voice audio in in
 
03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
significant enough ways to mislead the
 
03:33:51.389 --> 03:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
public so I'll end with that I believe
 
03:33:53.950 --> 03:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
that we should support this legislation
 
03:33:55.309 --> 03:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
and make sure we can address the
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
technology as must we can even if it
 
03:33:59.830 --> 03:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
means that we're the tortoise to the
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
hair thank you representative um and I
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
don't think that esops fables are
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
brought up enough in this committee so
 
03:34:09.830 --> 03:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for exactly appreciate it um I
 
03:34:12.189 --> 03:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
maybe the only one who who read it this
 
03:34:14.030 --> 03:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
way but I think representative Balden
 
03:34:15.870 --> 03:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
was trying to just show that as an
 
03:34:17.469 --> 03:34:17.479 align:start position:0%
example of Technologies we've had to
 
03:34:20.030 --> 03:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
deal with going along not that she's
 
03:34:23.110 --> 03:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about presidential um
 
03:34:27.030 --> 03:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
commercials but to the point this bill
 
03:34:31.389 --> 03:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
would um address people using AI to
 
03:34:31.399 --> 03:34:32.469 align:start position:0%
would um address people using AI to
create

03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
create
 
03:34:37.110 --> 03:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
voices which it can currently do um so
 
03:34:39.269 --> 03:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
that it is somewhat germine in that if
 
03:34:40.830 --> 03:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
you created a commercial with someone
 
03:34:43.070 --> 03:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
voice endorsing a product do you think
 
03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
that that would be covered under this if
 
03:34:47.469 --> 03:34:47.479 align:start position:0%
it was created using an artificial
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
intelligent platform and I think that
 
03:34:52.269 --> 03:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
would be valid I I think if if you
 
03:34:55.590 --> 03:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
created uh an advertisement you know
 
03:34:57.110 --> 03:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
even if it was with someone who has
 
03:34:58.750 --> 03:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
since passed I think it would be valid
 
03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
to say this is an advertisement that's
 
03:35:03.670 --> 03:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
used doing artificial intelligent with
 
03:35:05.150 --> 03:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
some whatever the wording would be on
 
03:35:07.630 --> 03:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
that because I think the example that
 
03:35:12.269 --> 03:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
representative Balden uses um it's uh
 
03:35:13.630 --> 03:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
pretty obvious that they're not it's
 
03:35:15.550 --> 03:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's an impersonator it's
 
03:35:18.469 --> 03:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's someone going I'm Abraham Lincoln
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
and schz one is very good actually
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
exactly right and so uh the algorithms
 
03:35:24.870 --> 03:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
the danger with them are they're so
 
03:35:27.630 --> 03:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
perfect and it's not distinguishable
 
03:35:30.630 --> 03:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
from reality but the the parodies the
 
03:35:32.990 --> 03:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
the the misleading nature of doing an
 
03:35:35.910 --> 03:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
advertisement for a business those are
 
03:35:38.590 --> 03:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
definitely uh observable especially to
 
03:35:40.750 --> 03:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
the to the regular lay person but but to
 
03:35:44.110 --> 03:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
the lay person unfortunately uh the AI
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
algorithms are not so that would be my
 
03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
answer to that thank you any further
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
questions to the representative keep in
 
03:35:51.550 --> 03:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
mind that we will be discussing this in
 
03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:57.479 --> 03:35:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:35:59.510 --> 03:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.520 --> 03:36:12.030 align:start position:0%
 
Gallagher

03:36:12.030 --> 03:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
 
03:36:15.510 --> 03:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Eric Gallagher uh representing
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
Mar County District 20 which is
 
03:36:20.510 --> 03:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
conquered w six I'm the co-sponsor of
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
this bill um testifying in favor of it
 
03:36:27.309 --> 03:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
and also with an amendment that I'm
 
03:36:30.790 --> 03:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
handing around um just some additional
 
03:36:33.269 --> 03:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
language that I had proposed that got
 
03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
lost in the shuffle of the drafting
 
03:36:39.710 --> 03:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
process um so basically one of my or
 
03:36:42.790 --> 03:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
some of my top issues are um software
 
03:36:47.950 --> 03:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
freedom and open source advocacy um so
 
03:36:51.870 --> 03:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
my uh amendment is basically intended to
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
introduce some elements of that into the
 
03:36:58.229 --> 03:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
bill um I think it actually addresses um
 
03:37:00.469 --> 03:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of the concerns that people were
 
03:37:01.630 --> 03:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
asking about
 
03:37:05.389 --> 03:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
previously um so it basically
 
03:37:09.630 --> 03:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
um adds a criteria about disclosure of
 
03:37:12.990 --> 03:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
the source code and training data to the
 
03:37:17.510 --> 03:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
definition of synthetic media um so um
 
03:37:21.189 --> 03:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
in the case of the question about um oh
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
how do we tell the difference between an
 
03:37:29.429 --> 03:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
AI algorithm versus like just one of
 
03:37:31.950 --> 03:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
your um
 
03:37:35.750 --> 03:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
previous pre- AI hype type algorithms
 
03:37:39.990 --> 03:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
that um get used in say Photoshop or
 
03:37:42.950 --> 03:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
whatever which had actually been
 
03:37:45.670 --> 03:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
considered AI too as well in previous
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
waves of AI but um don't think I don't
 
03:37:51.349 --> 03:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
think they're what as part of the intent
 
03:37:52.950 --> 03:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
here but anyways the way you tell the
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
difference there um would be is if
 
03:38:01.349 --> 03:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
there's a question about it um it if
 
03:38:04.710 --> 03:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
there's a court hearing then you would
 
03:38:07.630 --> 03:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
take a look at the source code um have
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
an expert look at testify as to
 
03:38:12.990 --> 03:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
whether the
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
um whether the algorithms
 
03:38:19.349 --> 03:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
involved uh count as artificial
 
03:38:20.950 --> 03:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
intelligence ones and then make your
 
03:38:25.389 --> 03:38:25.399 align:start position:0%
decisions from that um and then um also
 
03:38:29.309 --> 03:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
having to do with intent um I one of the
 
03:38:30.830 --> 03:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
previous Witnesses was saying I think
 
03:38:33.750 --> 03:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
there could be um an that there could be
 
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
an intent portion added um I think
 
03:38:39.830 --> 03:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the source code of software
 
03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
is a good way to figure out um what
 
03:38:48.429 --> 03:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
exactly the programmer's intent was when
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
creating it um so I think that would be
 
03:38:55.309 --> 03:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
an um additional helpful tool for
 
03:38:58.229 --> 03:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
figuring out uh what might qualify under
 
03:39:02.030 --> 03:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation or not um and um I'll
 
03:39:03.870 --> 03:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
take a few questions but I have to be
 
03:39:05.550 --> 03:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
out of here in a few minutes so let's
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
keep it
 
03:39:09.750 --> 03:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
quick we'll keep that in mind any
 
03:39:09.760 --> 03:39:10.750 align:start position:0%
quick we'll keep that in mind any
questions

03:39:10.750 --> 03:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:39:12.349 --> 03:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
no questions that's how quick we are
 
03:39:18.710 --> 03:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.189 --> 03:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
Kinsman see I told you you couldn't get
 
03:39:38.469 --> 03:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:40.590 --> 03:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
me good afternoon I know I know I was
 
03:39:42.269 --> 03:39:42.279 align:start position:0%
just here earlier for a previous bill
 
03:39:44.030 --> 03:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
but uh for the record for the purposes
 
03:39:46.349 --> 03:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
of this proposal uh my name is Eric
 
03:39:47.790 --> 03:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
hinsman I'm a lieutenant with the ports
 
03:39:49.110 --> 03:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
of police department and the current
 
03:39:50.349 --> 03:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
commander of the New Hampshire internet
 
03:39:53.349 --> 03:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
crimes against children task force um so
 
03:39:56.469 --> 03:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
first of all just for the record um I uh
 
03:39:58.229 --> 03:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative of mamea had reached out
 
03:40:00.750 --> 03:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
to me uh with some uh looking for some
 
03:40:03.710 --> 03:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
input uh because there was seemingly
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
there were some overlap with regard to
 
03:40:07.910 --> 03:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
some of the statutes that we use when
 
03:40:10.510 --> 03:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the dissemination of
 
03:40:12.910 --> 03:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
non-consensual sexual images for example
 
03:40:14.830 --> 03:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
or the distribution of child sexual
 
03:40:17.550 --> 03:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
abuse material um so I thought it was
 
03:40:19.630 --> 03:40:19.640 align:start position:0%
important for me to say for the record
 
03:40:22.830 --> 03:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
that um you know while I do uh admit
 
03:40:25.870 --> 03:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
that there seemingly is some editing and
 
03:40:27.269 --> 03:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
some adjusting that needs to be done
 
03:40:29.070 --> 03:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
with this proposal that in its Theory I
 
03:40:32.150 --> 03:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
do uh support it um and that I am here
 
03:40:35.229 --> 03:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
to speak in favor of uh House Bill 15500
 
03:40:36.990 --> 03:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh and again just to clarify any
 
03:40:39.229 --> 03:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
potential confusion that may arise as it
 
03:40:42.150 --> 03:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
relates to I CAC related investigations
 
03:40:45.469 --> 03:40:45.479 align:start position:0%
uh I can tell you that um while in some
 
03:40:47.389 --> 03:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
regards we don't necessarily have a
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
position on this bill I can tell you
 
03:40:52.910 --> 03:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
that it will not impact our ability to
 
03:40:56.150 --> 03:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
prosecute iak related crimes because we
 
03:40:58.349 --> 03:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
simply use other statutes when it talks
 
03:40:59.910 --> 03:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about the
 
03:41:02.590 --> 03:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
dissemination or the potential in
 
03:41:05.269 --> 03:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
dissemination of synthetic Media or
 
03:41:07.910 --> 03:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence uh media we
 
03:41:10.630 --> 03:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
would use we actually have uh another
 
03:41:13.229 --> 03:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
bill um that we had proposed and written
 
03:41:15.950 --> 03:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
so it would allow us to be able to cover
 
03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
AI generated material U but I will say
 
03:41:21.309 --> 03:41:21.319 align:start position:0%
that based on the intelligent uh
 
03:41:23.670 --> 03:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
questions that were uh brought by the
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee earlier with previous
 
03:41:27.870 --> 03:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
testimony um that I agree with you that
 
03:41:29.469 --> 03:41:29.479 align:start position:0%
there does seem to be some work done
 
03:41:31.070 --> 03:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
with this and that uh you know I'll
 
03:41:33.309 --> 03:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
certainly offer my two cents but I just
 
03:41:35.070 --> 03:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
thought it was important to make a note
 
03:41:37.389 --> 03:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
that it it won't affect iak related
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
investigations at
 
03:41:42.149 --> 03:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
all thank you
 
03:41:44.309 --> 03:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:08.960 --> 03:42:11.670 align:start position:0%
 
Spalding

03:42:11.670 --> 03:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
Spalding
 
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Scott spradling I am a
 
03:42:16.229 --> 03:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
representative of the New Hampshire
 
03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
Association of broadcasters here in New
 
03:42:19.830 --> 03:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which includes as our Client
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
List wmtv the radio stations New
 
03:42:24.550 --> 03:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Radio um we are a
 
03:42:26.750 --> 03:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofit Association who are
 
03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
essentially working along with
 
03:42:30.910 --> 03:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
broadcasters to help add voice to
 
03:42:32.670 --> 03:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
conversations like this very important
 
03:42:36.189 --> 03:42:36.199 align:start position:0%
one um like law enforcement allies like
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
all of you who are watching this issue
 
03:42:40.590 --> 03:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
and seeing things like the headline
 
03:42:43.229 --> 03:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
from uh what happened with the the this
 
03:42:46.110 --> 03:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
call from allegedly Joe Biden and the
 
03:42:48.670 --> 03:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
potential around artificial intelligence
 
03:42:51.030 --> 03:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the broadcast Community there are
 
03:42:53.389 --> 03:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
increasing concerns and in some cases
 
03:42:57.110 --> 03:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
grave concerns about um having to filter
 
03:43:00.269 --> 03:43:00.279 align:start position:0%
and police this system it's increasingly
 
03:43:03.750 --> 03:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
difficult and um where we are with this
 
03:43:06.990 --> 03:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
particular proposal is is simply this we
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
are very glad to hear that this
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
conversation is going on here at the
 
03:43:13.189 --> 03:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
state level and it's also happening at
 
03:43:14.670 --> 03:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
the federal level and I can share a
 
03:43:16.590 --> 03:43:16.600 align:start position:0%
couple of thoughts about that um where
 
03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
we have concern is in the language and
 
03:43:21.189 --> 03:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
elements of the bill where it seems to
 
03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
focus more on the Distributors and
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
distribution than it does on the
 
03:43:29.189 --> 03:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
creators I think if there is any general
 
03:43:31.309 --> 03:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
guidance that broadcasters would want to
 
03:43:32.790 --> 03:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
share with you as you have this
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
important conversation and we certainly
 
03:43:36.670 --> 03:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
encourage you to have it it's that
 
03:43:38.710 --> 03:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
Precision matters you know we can joke
 
03:43:39.870 --> 03:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
about and talk about what's the
 
03:43:41.429 --> 03:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
definition of Art and you kind of you
 
03:43:43.910 --> 03:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
know it when you see it um that's not
 
03:43:47.550 --> 03:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
this the speed of AI is moving so much
 
03:43:49.750 --> 03:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
quicker than even the broadcaster's
 
03:43:52.149 --> 03:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
ability to try and keep up with it as
 
03:43:54.429 --> 03:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
you all know the technology is becoming
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
so sophisticated it's really difficult
 
03:43:59.110 --> 03:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
from time to time to know the difference
 
03:44:01.189 --> 03:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
so representative MW asking the question
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
about if mu unwittingly put something
 
03:44:08.189 --> 03:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
out there that in fact was um uh an AI
 
03:44:12.389 --> 03:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
deep fake and um and this law this bill
 
03:44:14.950 --> 03:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
was law um by our reading of it we would
 
03:44:17.590 --> 03:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
be liable for that and this is
 
03:44:18.990 --> 03:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
increasingly difficult and let me give
 
03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
you one just super brief example uh
 
03:44:22.870 --> 03:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
broadcast newsrooms are spending an
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
increasing amount of time and resources
 
03:44:27.309 --> 03:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
to vet stories and footage verifying
 
03:44:29.149 --> 03:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
sources to ensure they continue to
 
03:44:32.269 --> 03:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
deliver trusted information for example
 
03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
after the terrorist attacks on Israel in
 
03:44:35.790 --> 03:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
October of
 
03:44:39.830 --> 03:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
2023 fake photos and videos reached an
 
03:44:42.670 --> 03:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
unprecedented level on social media in a
 
03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
matter of minutes of the thousands and
 
03:44:48.189 --> 03:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
thousands of videos that one broadcast
 
03:44:50.389 --> 03:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
network sifted through to report on the
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
attacks they were only able to verify
 
03:44:56.070 --> 03:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
roughly 10% now that's a broadcast
 
03:44:58.389 --> 03:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
network using a great deal of resources
 
03:45:00.990 --> 03:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
literally in the fog of a war to try to
 
03:45:03.269 --> 03:45:03.279 align:start position:0%
figure out what's real and what's not so
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
to your point uh the odds are not in the
 
03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
favor of people in the public to try to
 
03:45:10.229 --> 03:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
keep up with and discern
 
03:45:12.990 --> 03:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
really sophisticated AI but our message
 
03:45:15.790 --> 03:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
is that very simply precision and
 
03:45:17.870 --> 03:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
definition matters so in this
 
03:45:20.510 --> 03:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
conversation the idea of a conspicuous
 
03:45:23.149 --> 03:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
identification of what is AI it's going
 
03:45:24.950 --> 03:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
to need to be more than something that's
 
03:45:27.710 --> 03:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
conspicuous the AI algorithm may make
 
03:45:29.469 --> 03:45:29.479 align:start position:0%
sense to a lot of people who are experts
 
03:45:32.110 --> 03:45:32.120 align:start position:0%
in the field but to Everyday users of
 
03:45:34.349 --> 03:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
media they may not know the difference
 
03:45:35.910 --> 03:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of education and
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
definition that would have to go along
 
03:45:39.389 --> 03:45:39.399 align:start position:0%
with a conversation like this the idea
 
03:45:41.950 --> 03:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
of intent one person's intent versus
 
03:45:43.710 --> 03:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
another could be very difficult to
 
03:45:45.110 --> 03:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
discern and when you're putting
 
03:45:48.030 --> 03:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
punishments in for wrongdoing intent
 
03:45:50.070 --> 03:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
matters and again from the broadcasting
 
03:45:52.670 --> 03:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
perspective if we are unable to tell the
 
03:45:54.670 --> 03:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
difference and it takes time afterwards
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
when the horses left the proverbial Barn
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
um we have real we have real concerns
 
03:46:01.269 --> 03:46:01.279 align:start position:0%
about being liable for things that which
 
03:46:03.309 --> 03:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
we didn't know until potentially after
 
03:46:06.149 --> 03:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
the fact and of course again just to re
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
reinforce the idea that this bill seems
 
03:46:10.750 --> 03:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
to be focusing on distri ution and not
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily really focusing on
 
03:46:14.870 --> 03:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
identifying and possibly penalizing the
 
03:46:18.189 --> 03:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
creators of this content I think that's
 
03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
where the focus needs to be so from the
 
03:46:24.149 --> 03:46:24.159 align:start position:0%
broadcaster's perspective we um we uh we
 
03:46:25.710 --> 03:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate you having this conversation
 
03:46:27.269 --> 03:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
it's really important and it's important
 
03:46:28.830 --> 03:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
at the federal level too because I think
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
we need a Level Playing Field Nationwide
 
03:46:33.309 --> 03:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
especially since this is the kind of
 
03:46:34.950 --> 03:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
material that doesn't respect state
 
03:46:36.510 --> 03:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
lines and state borders we're going to
 
03:46:38.110 --> 03:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
be dealing with a lot of outof State
 
03:46:39.990 --> 03:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
entities which makes this even more
 
03:46:42.469 --> 03:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
complicated So to that extent we just
 
03:46:44.030 --> 03:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
have concerns about how this is set up
 
03:46:46.269 --> 03:46:46.279 align:start position:0%
and we we would appreciate um your
 
03:46:47.590 --> 03:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
understanding when it comes to
 
03:46:50.670 --> 03:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
definitions around distribution thank
 
03:46:54.630 --> 03:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
you questions represent
 
03:46:57.429 --> 03:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
Muse recognizing that the bill uh isn't
 
03:46:59.389 --> 03:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
perfect as the sponsor uh admitted in
 
03:47:00.950 --> 03:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
the first line of Our
 
03:47:03.870 --> 03:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
Testimony um one thing I am curious
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
about is what responsibility you think
 
03:47:10.830 --> 03:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh broadcasters have when it comes to
 
03:47:13.790 --> 03:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
disclosing material that's potentially
 
03:47:15.990 --> 03:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
AI generated especially things like
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
election ads where the Integrity of our
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
election process and our our primary
 
03:47:23.349 --> 03:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
process in particular is so important to
 
03:47:25.590 --> 03:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
so many people you bet so there are
 
03:47:27.870 --> 03:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
rules at the moment that don't yet
 
03:47:29.910 --> 03:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
account for artificial intelligence
 
03:47:32.189 --> 03:47:32.199 align:start position:0%
related technology that are the rules to
 
03:47:33.870 --> 03:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
be followed I I think you use some
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
examples of you know historic figures
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
like Abraham Lincoln who have obviously
 
03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
passed and you can spoof and everyone
 
03:47:41.229 --> 03:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
sort of knows that that's not the real
 
03:47:44.269 --> 03:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
deal we're now drifting very quickly
 
03:47:46.469 --> 03:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
into a place where the leading
 
03:47:48.349 --> 03:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
candidates for president the incumbent
 
03:47:50.189 --> 03:47:50.199 align:start position:0%
and the lead Challenger could very
 
03:47:52.750 --> 03:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
easily be uh taken advantage of through
 
03:47:55.469 --> 03:47:55.479 align:start position:0%
AI technology to create speeches Andor
 
03:47:58.110 --> 03:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
images that were never knew and are
 
03:48:00.830 --> 03:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult to discern
 
03:48:02.229 --> 03:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
representative Muse to answer your
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
question directly it's really hard to
 
03:48:07.149 --> 03:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
answer it because we don't necessarily
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
have equal access throughout broadcast
 
03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
media especially at the local level to
 
03:48:13.389 --> 03:48:13.399 align:start position:0%
the kind of Technology that's necessary
 
03:48:16.269 --> 03:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
to Fed out what's real and what isn't
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
the example that I gave before was a
 
03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
national Network that has more intense
 
03:48:22.750 --> 03:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
resources to be able to discern that
 
03:48:25.269 --> 03:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
kind of thing versus a local Newsroom
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
that might see things on social media
 
03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
and if they can't verify it then their
 
03:48:32.750 --> 03:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
rule is they can't use it so it's a it's
 
03:48:34.910 --> 03:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
a it's an area of gray that I think
 
03:48:36.670 --> 03:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
should also be discussed as part of this
 
03:48:39.070 --> 03:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
bill around who has the responsibility I
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
can tell tell you that broadcasters take
 
03:48:42.750 --> 03:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
this task very seriously and especially
 
03:48:44.750 --> 03:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
from a local level you know my friends
 
03:48:48.189 --> 03:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
at WM TV sift through the social media
 
03:48:50.149 --> 03:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
that we all sift through to sometimes
 
03:48:52.590 --> 03:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
see audio and video of events and things
 
03:48:53.950 --> 03:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
that could be of a newsworthy and
 
03:48:56.590 --> 03:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
noteworthy um level that they would then
 
03:48:59.149 --> 03:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
share on TV they do their best to reach
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
out to the um the person that put that
 
03:49:04.149 --> 03:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
out there to verify so there are steps
 
03:49:06.590 --> 03:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
that are taken um but the technology is
 
03:49:09.510 --> 03:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
now advancing past an easy ability to
 
03:49:11.550 --> 03:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
discern whether or not it's even real
 
03:49:14.070 --> 03:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
much less who put it out there so it's
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's a challenging conversation because
 
03:49:17.910 --> 03:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
I think most of us want the free
 
03:49:19.750 --> 03:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
exchange of information and what we want
 
03:49:22.630 --> 03:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
to do is hold the Bad actors responsible
 
03:49:24.550 --> 03:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
those who want to use this technology to
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
influence opinions and actions uh to
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
their control and that's where that
 
03:49:31.429 --> 03:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
Focus needs to be so I think there are
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
steps that are taken we can be a part of
 
03:49:34.750 --> 03:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
that conversation but it's it's a little
 
03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
bit gray because there's no hard and
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
fast rule of
 
03:49:38.319 --> 03:49:42.229 align:start position:0%
fast rule of
law

03:49:42.229 --> 03:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:44.670 --> 03:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
so about a year or so ago there was an
 
03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
ad that ran on WMUR and it showed uh Joe
 
03:49:50.950 --> 03:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
Biden walking around in some sort of
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
post apoplectic uh you know landscape
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
obviously it wasn't Joe Biden it was
 
03:50:02.910 --> 03:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
obviously uh generated uh by by AI uh it
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
gave a misleading impression um and I'm
 
03:50:07.319 --> 03:50:08.229 align:start position:0%
gave a misleading impression um and I'm
I'm

03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:50:12.950 --> 03:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
curious would we or would you you know
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
how would how would you suggest
 
03:50:17.790 --> 03:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
broadcasters approach and AD they
 
03:50:19.830 --> 03:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
receive like that today obviously this
 
03:50:22.870 --> 03:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
was all very new uh a year or so ago but
 
03:50:25.469 --> 03:50:25.479 align:start position:0%
knowing what you know now and having had
 
03:50:27.229 --> 03:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
some of these conversations around
 
03:50:28.750 --> 03:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
standards and what you should and
 
03:50:30.870 --> 03:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't run what are the processes
 
03:50:33.510 --> 03:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
that you think stations like WM should
 
03:50:35.910 --> 03:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
have in place when it comes to a
 
03:50:38.189 --> 03:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
decision about whether or not to allow
 
03:50:40.990 --> 03:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
an ad like that to to be run sure and I
 
03:50:43.189 --> 03:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
think where where that comes down is um
 
03:50:45.910 --> 03:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
there are federal laws that stations and
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
broadcasters have to follow and so the
 
03:50:49.750 --> 03:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
example that you're using is along the
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
lines of something that is um pretty
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
easily identified by broad audiences as
 
03:50:57.030 --> 03:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
a spoof that the ad in question that
 
03:50:58.590 --> 03:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
you're talking about if if it looks like
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
he's stumbling around in some alternate
 
03:51:02.149 --> 03:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
reality and it's very clear that that's
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
not like real video captured by of Joe
 
03:51:07.950 --> 03:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
Biden doing something like that it it
 
03:51:10.830 --> 03:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
sort of passes a basic common
 
03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
understanding type of test that is
 
03:51:14.510 --> 03:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
essentially what the barometer is around
 
03:51:16.510 --> 03:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
broadcasting nowadays and I think the
 
03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
challenge that we all face is that this
 
03:51:20.349 --> 03:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
technology that we are talking about
 
03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
poses a very real threat to what could
 
03:51:27.429 --> 03:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
be a very obvious line between spoofing
 
03:51:30.070 --> 03:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
and um something that's clearly not real
 
03:51:32.149 --> 03:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
to using technology that makes it very
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
much look like Joe Biden was on the
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
phone with Vladimir Putin saying this
 
03:51:40.110 --> 03:51:40.120 align:start position:0%
exact same quote holy cow this is
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
terrible so that is the kind of
 
03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
challenge that I think we're all facing
 
03:51:47.349 --> 03:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
and so for broadcasters obviously they
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
want to maximize the flexibility and
 
03:51:50.469 --> 03:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
freedoms to be able to use the different
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
broadcast medium and content that's out
 
03:51:54.510 --> 03:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
there but we definitely need to figure
 
03:51:57.950 --> 03:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
out how to best identify and timestamp
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
and permanently Stamp Those things that
 
03:52:01.710 --> 03:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
are created by AI so that we have a
 
03:52:03.550 --> 03:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
fighting chance and I think that's where
 
03:52:05.389 --> 03:52:05.399 align:start position:0%
the focus needs to be is around the
 
03:52:07.510 --> 03:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
creation of this content and not
 
03:52:09.149 --> 03:52:09.159 align:start position:0%
specifically around the distribution
 
03:52:14.389 --> 03:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:14.399 --> 03:52:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
helps

03:52:15.910 --> 03:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
helps
 
03:52:18.590 --> 03:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
repres thank you and thank you for
 
03:52:21.189 --> 03:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so is your
 
03:52:23.189 --> 03:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
assertion because it it does seem like
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
in this bill there are some guard rails
 
03:52:26.389 --> 03:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
because it's around intent right and
 
03:52:28.269 --> 03:52:28.279 align:start position:0%
that might be a little fuzzy to um flesh
 
03:52:31.389 --> 03:52:31.399 align:start position:0%
out but is your assertion that um that
 
03:52:34.429 --> 03:52:34.439 align:start position:0%
is not um that's not sufficient to
 
03:52:36.550 --> 03:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
protecting uh broadcasters against
 
03:52:39.630 --> 03:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
liability for unknowingly yes
 
03:52:41.790 --> 03:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
okay yes ma'am yeah I that is from from
 
03:52:43.510 --> 03:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
a legal liability perspective I think
 
03:52:45.030 --> 03:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's nowhere near sufficient and I
 
03:52:46.790 --> 03:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
think that the the focus of this
 
03:52:49.110 --> 03:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
conversation and this bill really should
 
03:52:51.990 --> 03:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
start with those who are creating this
 
03:52:54.110 --> 03:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
content in the first place and one of
 
03:52:55.790 --> 03:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
the challenges this committee faces that
 
03:52:57.189 --> 03:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
I think we all face is that we're all
 
03:52:59.870 --> 03:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
connected globally and that the content
 
03:53:01.670 --> 03:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
that could be creating problems for all
 
03:53:03.990 --> 03:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
of us in this room may very well be
 
03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
coming from places where we can't even
 
03:53:07.910 --> 03:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
reach to them it just creates
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
complications and to point it's not like
 
03:53:12.189 --> 03:53:12.199 align:start position:0%
so don't have the conversation we
 
03:53:13.950 --> 03:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
support this and we want to be a part of
 
03:53:16.429 --> 03:53:16.439 align:start position:0%
the conversation but yes we we do worry
 
03:53:18.429 --> 03:53:18.439 align:start position:0%
about the the way this bill is written
 
03:53:20.670 --> 03:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
it puts the broadcasters squarely in the
 
03:53:23.630 --> 03:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
crosshairs of liability thank
 
03:53:26.229 --> 03:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
scitec hi early in your remarks you said
 
03:53:31.229 --> 03:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
that the federal government might be
 
03:53:32.990 --> 03:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
doing something about this and you did
 
03:53:36.149 --> 03:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
not elaborate on that are should we
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
maybe wait to see what the feds do
 
03:53:40.070 --> 03:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
because they may just sweep all this
 
03:53:43.269 --> 03:53:43.279 align:start position:0%
aside so they could I would never advise
 
03:53:44.550 --> 03:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh the great people of the State of New
 
03:53:46.229 --> 03:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to wait for Washington for
 
03:53:49.229 --> 03:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
much of anything so with that said um I
 
03:53:50.710 --> 03:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
what what I would hope is that we could
 
03:53:52.429 --> 03:53:52.439 align:start position:0%
raise some awareness to conversations
 
03:53:54.590 --> 03:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
that are ongoing I do believe that there
 
03:53:57.229 --> 03:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
are there have been numerous US Senate
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
hearings in their Communications
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
committees as well as a absolutely
 
03:54:03.950 --> 03:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing conversation around trying to
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
figure out policy through the Federal
 
03:54:08.429 --> 03:54:08.439 align:start position:0%
Communications Commission the FCC that
 
03:54:11.309 --> 03:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
oversees all broadcasting of radio and
 
03:54:13.910 --> 03:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
television to try to figure out how to
 
03:54:15.710 --> 03:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
begin tackling this there are hearings
 
03:54:17.910 --> 03:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
going on but that I'm aware of there has
 
03:54:19.269 --> 03:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
not been anything that has been
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
developed that would focus on the kind
 
03:54:25.269 --> 03:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
today see no further questions thank you
 
03:54:37.870 --> 03:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:37.880 --> 03:54:49.710 align:start position:0%
 
Enders

03:54:49.710 --> 03:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.189 --> 03:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Stephen ERS
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
I'm an assistant County attorney in
 
03:54:53.870 --> 03:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
Marat County with me is attorney
 
03:54:55.590 --> 03:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
Halverson who's the Marat County
 
03:54:57.590 --> 03:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
attorney um both of us have been
 
03:54:59.309 --> 03:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
prosecutors for over 20
 
03:55:02.149 --> 03:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
years I don't necessarily support or
 
03:55:04.110 --> 03:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill I just think there's a
 
03:55:05.309 --> 03:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
couple things that are worth pointing
 
03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
out or
 
03:55:08.670 --> 03:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
discussing the the definition section
 
03:55:10.630 --> 03:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
when it talks about synthetic media is
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
specific about media that is created or
 
03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
modified through the use of artificial
 
03:55:16.040 --> 03:55:18.990 align:start position:0%
modified through the use of artificial
intelligence

03:55:18.990 --> 03:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
algorithms that I think would be a very
 
03:55:24.269 --> 03:55:24.279 align:start position:0%
difficult thing to prove in court um
 
03:55:26.950 --> 03:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about we had a bill
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
last week House Bill 1319 that talked
 
03:55:32.790 --> 03:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
about synthetic images that had a much
 
03:55:34.510 --> 03:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
broader definition which would include
 
03:55:37.030 --> 03:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
things that were done without the use of
 
03:55:39.269 --> 03:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence when we're
 
03:55:41.189 --> 03:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
talking about the the robo call the
 
03:55:44.189 --> 03:55:44.199 align:start position:0%
recent Robo call of President Biden it
 
03:55:46.030 --> 03:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
it strikes me that there's three
 
03:55:47.830 --> 03:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
possible ways that something like that
 
03:55:49.990 --> 03:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
is created the first one obviously is
 
03:55:52.590 --> 03:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence the the second
 
03:55:54.389 --> 03:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
way that call could be created is if you
 
03:55:56.309 --> 03:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
have someone who's really really good at
 
03:56:00.070 --> 03:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
doing impressions of uh Joe Biden who
 
03:56:02.510 --> 03:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
sits down and records that call and the
 
03:56:03.990 --> 03:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
third way you could do it is there's
 
03:56:06.389 --> 03:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
enough video of Joe Biden saying
 
03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
probably almost every word in the Engish
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
English language at this point that if
 
03:56:12.990 --> 03:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
you sat down and took a lot of time and
 
03:56:15.750 --> 03:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
cut and paste and stitched all that
 
03:56:17.590 --> 03:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
together you could probably come up with
 
03:56:18.550 --> 03:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
a pretty
 
03:56:21.670 --> 03:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
convincing um Joe Biden phone
 
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
call it would be difficult as a
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
prosecutor to prove sort of which one of
 
03:56:28.510 --> 03:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
those three methods resulted in that
 
03:56:31.149 --> 03:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
phone call being created I I understand
 
03:56:33.630 --> 03:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
if we had the the source code of that
 
03:56:35.790 --> 03:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
that call that we might be able to do
 
03:56:38.670 --> 03:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
that but presumably as a process
 
03:56:40.229 --> 03:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
prosecutor I'm not going to end up
 
03:56:42.149 --> 03:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
having the source code of that call I'm
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
going to have a recording of it and that
 
03:56:46.790 --> 03:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
recording isn't going to tell me
 
03:56:49.750 --> 03:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
anything about how it was created um
 
03:56:51.630 --> 03:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
which under this current definition I
 
03:56:53.309 --> 03:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
would have to prove Beyond A Reasonable
 
03:56:55.630 --> 03:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
Doubt in court that artificial
 
03:56:57.790 --> 03:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
intelligence algorithms were used and I
 
03:57:01.630 --> 03:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
think that becomes a difficult hurdle to
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
overcome the other thing that I would
 
03:57:07.790 --> 03:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
suggest is paragraph two and then
 
03:57:10.990 --> 03:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph three paragraph 3 talks about
 
03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:12.710 align:start position:0%
paragraph three paragraph 3 talks about
um

03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:16.189 --> 03:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
elections we already have where this
 
03:57:30.990 --> 03:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:31.000 --> 03:57:32.750 align:start position:0%
 
638-2636

03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
638-2636
 
03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
66 which is a very omnis statute but is
 
03:57:39.510 --> 03:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions for Pur of
 
03:57:41.790 --> 03:57:41.800 align:start position:0%
Elections uh I would suggest that for
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
two reasons the first reason is since it
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
is specifically an election Law related
 
03:57:48.830 --> 03:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
statute I think it belongs better in the
 
03:57:50.910 --> 03:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
election law section than in the
 
03:57:53.149 --> 03:57:53.159 align:start position:0%
criminal law section the other reason
 
03:57:54.670 --> 03:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
that I would suggest making it clear
 
03:57:57.790 --> 03:57:57.800 align:start position:0%
that it goes into RSA 666 is that in New
 
03:57:59.950 --> 03:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the Attorney General's office
 
03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
has exclusive jurisdiction over all
 
03:58:04.910 --> 03:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
election um and election interference
 
03:58:07.550 --> 03:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
election fraud that type of thing so
 
03:58:10.229 --> 03:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
normally as a county attorney's office
 
03:58:12.469 --> 03:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
we would never see election interference
 
03:58:14.269 --> 03:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
cases those would all go directly to the
 
03:58:16.149 --> 03:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to be
 
03:58:18.950 --> 03:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
prosecuted by them don't if you have
 
03:58:20.149 --> 03:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
anything to
 
03:58:23.229 --> 03:58:23.239 align:start position:0%
add the only the only comment I would
 
03:58:26.229 --> 03:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
add would be um I'll start at the end of
 
03:58:28.429 --> 03:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
attorney ers' comments if you do move
 
03:58:31.550 --> 03:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
that section to the uh election law
 
03:58:33.070 --> 03:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
obviously the penalty section would be
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
bifurcated split between the two uh the
 
03:58:39.149 --> 03:58:39.159 align:start position:0%
two relevant statutes um the other one
 
03:58:41.110 --> 03:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
comment that I have is on talking about
 
03:58:43.269 --> 03:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
the a conspicuous notice within the
 
03:58:47.910 --> 03:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
media um I think that we all know from
 
03:58:49.870 --> 03:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
doing elections that we're required to
 
03:58:53.070 --> 03:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
put a paid buy statement on our or on
 
03:58:55.950 --> 03:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
our paid advertising stuff like that in
 
03:58:57.750 --> 03:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
the printed media it's often a little
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
disclaimer down the bottom that someone
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
has to look for uh I think that as this
 
03:59:07.030 --> 03:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
is written I think that a person doing a
 
03:59:09.110 --> 03:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
complying with the with the note could
 
03:59:12.590 --> 03:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
do that on an image or a video and it
 
03:59:17.030 --> 03:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
not be obvious so I think you'd have to
 
03:59:19.790 --> 03:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
Define what conspicuous is such as with
 
03:59:22.389 --> 03:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
an image centered in the image so people
 
03:59:26.309 --> 03:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
know it's conspicuous um uh so big such
 
03:59:29.670 --> 03:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
a location contrasting uh text item such
 
03:59:30.910 --> 03:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
as that I think that would have to be
 
03:59:30.920 --> 03:59:32.389 align:start position:0%
as that I think that would have to be
fleshed

03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
fleshed
 
03:59:32.399 --> 03:59:37.429 align:start position:0%
fleshed
out

03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:39.189 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:40.070 --> 03:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
other than that I don't have any
 
03:59:41.790 --> 03:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
additional any additional comments
 
03:59:43.870 --> 03:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
gladly take your
 
03:59:46.229 --> 03:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions represent
 
03:59:48.269 --> 03:59:48.279 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:59:50.670 --> 03:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
for T taking my question uh this
 
03:59:51.429 --> 03:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
question I'm gonna have a little
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
scenario with it but it's going to piggy
 
03:59:54.630 --> 03:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
back on what Mr spradling said in the
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
question by rep new section three
 
04:00:02.830 --> 04:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
specifically is so broad that if I were
 
04:00:05.790 --> 04:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
to distribute a video I found on Twitter
 
04:00:10.349 --> 04:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
or X of a p political candidate saying
 
04:00:13.389 --> 04:00:13.399 align:start position:0%
something created by AI but I don't know
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
it but I distribute that because I know
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
that um it could be damning to that
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
candidate so I sent it to my friends
 
04:00:25.830 --> 04:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
hoping to influence their
 
04:00:28.309 --> 04:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
vote all I've I've reached every element
 
04:00:30.469 --> 04:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
in that section there but I didn't know
 
04:00:32.510 --> 04:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
I did it because I didn't know it was
 
04:00:34.469 --> 04:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
fake so I could be charged is it your
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
opinion I could be charged under that
 
04:00:37.319 --> 04:00:39.309 align:start position:0%
opinion I could be charged under that
section

04:00:39.309 --> 04:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:00:41.830 --> 04:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
i' say yes yeah I mean my intent is I
 
04:00:45.149 --> 04:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
would my intent is to specifically uh
 
04:00:48.149 --> 04:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
right you know I would say technically
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes but I think that
 
04:00:53.990 --> 04:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
the that the facts might dictate
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
discretion in the prosecution from my
 
04:00:58.990 --> 04:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
office uh however Attorney General's
 
04:01:00.510 --> 04:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
office since it's an election issue
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
would be the final Arbiter on the
 
04:01:04.229 --> 04:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
election side of things in my opinion
 
04:01:05.830 --> 04:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
but I've already been arrested and
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
charged and I've got to wait at that
 
04:01:07.760 --> 04:01:08.990 align:start position:0%
charged and I've got to wait at that
point

04:01:08.990 --> 04:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:01:10.309 --> 04:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
AG's office I don't know how they would
 
04:01:12.870 --> 04:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
view it thank you does the does the
 
04:01:16.550 --> 04:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
statute in your opinion have um intent
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
and knowing as well I mean the proper
 
04:01:20.670 --> 04:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
men's ready to actually to know what
 
04:01:22.630 --> 04:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
you're being charged with and actually
 
04:01:26.429 --> 04:01:26.439 align:start position:0%
doing it it could certainly be worded
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
more clearly that you purposely
 
04:01:31.950 --> 04:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
distribute or make publicly available
 
04:01:33.950 --> 04:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
within this state what the actor knows
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
is synthetic media um and that's not in
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:46.550 --> 04:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
Balden um on the topic of I think
 
04:01:52.630 --> 04:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
earlier another lawmaker brought
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
up teens on social media um if there
 
04:02:01.030 --> 04:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
was I know like on not that I use it a
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
lot but on Instagram or Tik Tok or
 
04:02:05.710 --> 04:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
something they have those fake faces you
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
can wear MH and it I suppose it's
 
04:02:10.830 --> 04:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
possible for that fake face to be
 
04:02:14.630 --> 04:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
modeled off of a real human being in if
 
04:02:17.469 --> 04:02:17.479 align:start position:0%
maybe a teenager who doesn't understand
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
politics or something puts on a a trump
 
04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
face and says vote for Joe Biden on
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
social media could that under this
 
04:02:33.389 --> 04:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
wording could that minor be charged and
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
also would that would the minor be
 
04:02:39.070 --> 04:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for making making it clear
 
04:02:41.469 --> 04:02:41.479 align:start position:0%
that that's synthetic Media or would it
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
be the responsibility of the app or if
 
04:02:47.349 --> 04:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
there's um like a thirdparty person
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
who's created the graphic would it be
 
04:02:49.680 --> 04:02:50.630 align:start position:0%
who's created the graphic would it be
their

04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:02:52.830 --> 04:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility yeah I think it would be
 
04:02:54.269 --> 04:02:54.279 align:start position:0%
on the responsibility of the person
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
who's Distributing or making publicly
 
04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
available that that document and I I
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
mean I can give you an example from my
 
04:03:05.269 --> 04:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
past is there used to be a magazine
 
04:03:09.269 --> 04:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
called Super Lawyers and it us it always
 
04:03:11.630 --> 04:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
had you know the typical like lawyer
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
picture on the front
 
04:03:16.830 --> 04:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
page and our office hired a new attorney
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I went on the bar website and I took
 
04:03:21.149 --> 04:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
their photograph and I cut it out and I
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
pasted it on the cover of Super Lawyers
 
04:03:24.630 --> 04:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
and I printed it out and I taped it to
 
04:03:27.030 --> 04:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
her desk so that on her first day she
 
04:03:30.149 --> 04:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
got this nice you know she's a super
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
lawyer I think technically if I did that
 
04:03:36.149 --> 04:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
using artificial intelligence
 
04:03:38.710 --> 04:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
algorithms that could potentially
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
run a foul of paragraph two unless I put
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
something on there
 
04:03:46.550 --> 04:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
saying um you know this is synthetic
 
04:03:49.550 --> 04:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
media I've I've made this up so I think
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
there is the potential for this statute
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
to be maybe broader than it intends to
 
04:04:01.630 --> 04:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
be I think too that if it's if it's not
 
04:04:03.389 --> 04:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
created by synthetic media and it's
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
obvious by the presentation someone
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
dressed up as somebody where obvious
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
differences between a real person and
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
the and a person dressed up as somebody
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
that may not fall on probably wouldn't
 
04:04:15.389 --> 04:04:15.399 align:start position:0%
fall under this because it's not
 
04:04:15.399 --> 04:04:18.229 align:start position:0%
fall under this because it's not
synthetic

04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
medor thank you Representative no thank
 
04:04:26.590 --> 04:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
you um I just wanted to ask a question
 
04:04:28.030 --> 04:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
it was brought up earlier in the
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
conversation around free speech and the
 
04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
possibility that this would be free
 
04:04:33.510 --> 04:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
speech and maybe this is more so
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
speaking about the Creator but I think
 
04:04:37.630 --> 04:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
it could also be um it could also
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
pertain to someone who is sharing it is
 
04:04:42.870 --> 04:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
um and let me just preface what I
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
understand you know the the concept of
 
04:04:46.990 --> 04:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
of speech and and what defines that in
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
elections is pretty interesting
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
especially campaign Finance but my
 
04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
question is where is the line um as far
 
04:04:56.670 --> 04:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
as you know what what what is considered
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
Free Speech when you would essentially
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
be hijacking someone else's free speech
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
um to it's specifically about AI I'm
 
04:05:05.830 --> 04:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not explaining this well
 
04:05:08.189 --> 04:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
specifically about AI in imperson
 
04:05:10.550 --> 04:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
someone else I I wonder how that could
 
04:05:12.269 --> 04:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
be considered someone's Free Speech when
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
it is intentionally hijacking someone
 
04:05:16.590 --> 04:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
else's free speech I making sense I
 
04:05:19.349 --> 04:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
think parody does that all the
 
04:05:22.750 --> 04:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
time you know and certainly the
 
04:05:25.550 --> 04:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
application needs to be content
 
04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
neutral beyond that I think it's very
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
fact very fact
 
04:05:33.950 --> 04:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
specific thank you I mean I I think
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's certainly Free Speech
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
implications with this
 
04:05:39.149 --> 04:05:39.159 align:start position:0%
bill having said that that's a
 
04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional law question not a
 
04:05:43.750 --> 04:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
criminal law question um
 
04:05:46.950 --> 04:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully um further questions seeing
 
04:05:48.510 --> 04:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
none thank you both for your testimony
 
04:05:50.189 --> 04:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
today anyone else wishing to testify in
 
04:05:52.189 --> 04:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
this bill who has not done so seeing
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
none I hereby close the public
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:06.800 --> 04:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
day
