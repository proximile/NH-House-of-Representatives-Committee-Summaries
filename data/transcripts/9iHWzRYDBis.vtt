00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
and the sum of five million for the
 
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year ending june 30th 2023
 
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
to the frm victims contribution recovery
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
fund established in rsa
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
359 p colon 2.
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
now when i first looked at this in the
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
first version
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
the draft version of hb2 it read 5
 
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.990 align:start position:0%
the draft version of hb2 it read 5
million

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
but then when i saw the later version it
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
was changed to like half a million
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i saw no had no explanation why
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
but i know that if you put 10 million in
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
there someone's going to grab it because
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
they think it's coming out of general
 
00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:06.790 align:start position:0%
they think it's coming out of general
fund

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
so i've amended rsa 359 p2
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
as you can see uh where this was it this
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
has been in law since 2013
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
and i've changed some of the language
 
00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
there so
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
at one point it said they would have to
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
go out and recruit a lawyer that would
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
work for 10
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
of the of the money raised
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
without naming a uh
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
an appropriation this one says for the
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 align:start position:0%

to achieve the 10 million dollars
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%

359 p4 which have also changed the
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
language a bit so that'll work
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh it used to say the director shall
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%

levels within the department
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
and then we move on to cha make some
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
slight changes to
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
rsa 7 colon 6f i have
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
consulted with both secretary of state
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
bill gartner
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
these funds are not to be used except
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
for investor education but he approved
 
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.790 align:start position:0%
for investor education but he approved
them

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
to be in in this fund and also i've
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
talked with
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
mc gordon mcdonald when he was the
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
he said there's about 9 million a year
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
investor or it's let's see what the
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection escrow account
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
and it cannot exceed five million they
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
usually use it within house to to pay
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
for the attorneys that are working in
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
consumer protection
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
so um i changed that so that
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
there won't be any question when the
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
money comes out of that fund
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
that it that it is able to be taken out
 
00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.829 align:start position:0%
that it that it is able to be taken out
so

00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
this this amendment involves a few
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
sections of law
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any question ken

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
however i wanted to have
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
any committee member have a chance to
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
ask a question about the funding
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
i know some people are not in favor of
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
this we will be
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
discussing those kinds of items when we
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
have an actual
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
committee hearing and i can say that

daughter and
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
husband are around or maybe she but
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%

funding mechanism because while ken
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%

moved over
gordon

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
okay all right so a few little ground
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
rules we
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
you're happily in a room where
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
we have joined the herd via either
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine or tracy's method was having
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
covered in recovering so
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
when we all move he has the deep move
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
because he took the hard route and the
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
rest of us kind of squeak in soprano
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
but it is good for us to have be started
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
to be crossed into a
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
situation where covet is endemic and not
 
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.829 align:start position:0%
situation where covet is endemic and not
pandemic

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
you are welcome the microphone you have
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
to push it forward you'll have a real
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
little red light we do have a little
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty with people at home hearing
 
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.870 align:start position:0%
difficulty with people at home hearing
so

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
i ask you to be kind of pulling my
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
mic close even here and we try to make
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
everybody be able to hear
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
um well good morning madam chair members
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
of division one i
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
i heard my own account of that your
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
session together i
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
heard something about lambs and
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
slaughter and
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
i thought they did a good job they
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
needed to send us a crosswalk which they
 
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.310 align:start position:0%
needed to send us a crosswalk which they
did

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
and they found an errata sheet which
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
with budget errors
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
which we approved yesterday so those
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
have been fixed
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
so i didn't think they were slaughtered
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
or lambs but it was her first time and
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
with us this morning answering the
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
divisions questions and the chairs
 
00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:12.949 align:start position:0%
divisions questions and the chairs
questions

00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
trust me by last night i didn't see it
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
i'm only getting a minor
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
two to three thousand emails a day about
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
what we're doing in the budget
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
don't cut this cut them no don't cut me
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
cut them
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
um so let me let me touch on a few
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
highlights and give an overview of the
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
judicial branch for the benefit of
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
division members and then turn it over
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
to donna for a more detailed discussion
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
on our submission
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
if if you have your slides the slides
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
before you let me
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
let me talk about two basic principles
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
underlying the judicial branch
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch budget is primarily
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
generally funded and as you will see for
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal 22 and 23 it's
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
basically 94 next principle
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
is the next slide which is
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
about 74 of the branches budget
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
is personnel related and i know uh
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
division members know the consequences
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
and the and the implications of that
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
year over year change over uh fy 21
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized is 4.4
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
for uh fy 22 say fiscal year 22 and then
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh 4.1 percent for state year fiscal
 
00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:57.669 align:start position:0%
uh 4.1 percent for state year fiscal
year

00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
23. and then slide
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
21 gives you an overview
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
of the new positions and other
 
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.710 align:start position:0%
of the new positions and other

through the landlord tenant dockett
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
initially the landlord tenant docket
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
is predominated as are most
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
cases in the circuit court by
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
the landlord tenant docket is very
 
00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
the landlord tenant docket is very
challenging

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
for two reasons one is it is statute
 
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:16.950 align:start position:0%
for two reasons one is it is statute
based

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
based
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
and deadline driven and the second is
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
there will be a wave of landlord-tenant
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
cases coming
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
the idea of court navigators are to
 
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:30.870 align:start position:0%
the idea of court navigators are to
assist

on critical deadlines
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
and generally helping to navigate what
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
can be a
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
very foreign and intimidating process
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
the business proposition madam chair for
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%

in sort of divert if you will
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
questions relating to the substance of
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
this docket
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
to the navigator program
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
the two positions before you and the
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation that goes with it
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
will help leverage a federal grant in
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
the amount of a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%

so are these positions federally funded
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
or generally funded no these are the
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
positions before you are generally
 
00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.190 align:start position:0%

i'd now like to give a brief overview of
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
the judicial
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
this is the organizational chart for the
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%

so there are currently five vacancies so
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
so let me go back to
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know page 20 or 21 but but

whatever we looked at
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
you said 35 full-time judges are
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
authorized you added to circuit court

so did you fund two more out of the 45
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
so you now have 37
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%

the commission if the division is

amenable to it i'd like to turn it over
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
to donna raymond to give an overview
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
of some of the budget details we'll be
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
happy to take it from
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
donna but donna give me just a second
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
yesterday congress passed the covet
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
relief bill
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i fully expect that president biden
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
will sign it
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
i'm on the executive council
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
state reps take care of their county
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
budgets as well
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
we didn't have enough to do so i'm on
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
the executive committee in hillsborough
 
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.870 align:start position:0%
the executive committee in hillsborough
county

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county alone is is
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
projected to get and this is online so
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
news you can't read if you haven't been
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know that on the government website
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
they've got this hillsborough county is
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
projected to
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
get an additional 80 million dollars the
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
formula is something like
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
of that 80 million 70 you'll only get 75
 
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.149 align:start position:0%
of that 80 million 70 you'll only get 75
percent

00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
of whatever your operating budget was
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
but it's one-time money every county is
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
getting it
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
it's one-time money to be spent on
 
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.470 align:start position:0%
it's one-time money to be spent on
infrastructure

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
so let me remind you our courts are in
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
our county systems
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
do you have buildings that have some
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure needs that don't get
 
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.630 align:start position:0%
infrastructure needs that don't get
budgeted

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
budgeted
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
i highly advise you to work with all of
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
the counties
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh the city of manchester alone
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
is expected to get 44 million dollars
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
so i don't know whether parking issues
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
at one of your things someplace
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
let me put that in your ear you're going
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
to pass here but we've got this other
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
thing coming up
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
according to what is online you will be
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
able to spend that money through
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
2024. so i've just been reading the
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
federal website because
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
obviously i don't have enough to do here
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
clearly i don't have enough to do with
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
the budget so
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
but you guys this impacts you in every
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
county and i wanted to mention
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
so good morning so um chief justice
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
gordon mcdonald already took you through
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
some of the slides
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
mary beth can you hear her yeah
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
all right um with some of the slides
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the budget overview
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
um so i don't know that i really need to
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
repeat any of that no
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
don't repeat with each other we'll go
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
right into the gory detail
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
yep gory details where we want to be all
 
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.789 align:start position:0%
yep gory details where we want to be all
right

00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
that will take us to slide
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
and the budget for you um uh starts on
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
page 196
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
so i thought it would be helpful um if i
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
provided just an explanation
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
of what is in some of our expense class
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
lines because they can be a little bit
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
different sometimes in the executive
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
branch agency so hopefully this will be
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
helpful to you
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
after this meeting as you read through
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
our budget again to understand
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
what some of those class lines actually
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
are so now i will
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
go line by line through the budget with
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
an explanation
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
of each class line yep
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
so we're starting with 1880 which is the
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
supreme superior
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
and the administrative office of the
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
courts are all budgeted in this
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
class 10 is where our clerical staff
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
are budgeted in for full time and
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
the amounts that you see in 22 and 23
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you've heard this so many
 
00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.110 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you've heard this so many
times

00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year 23 has 27 27th pay period
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
which you know probably in your sleep
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
but yes that will be responsible for
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
some of those increases um
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
so what we see here is the increase is
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
the net impact of position
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
adjustments so throughout the course of
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 and 21 we have
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
adjusted positions such that it netted
 
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
out to two full-time positions
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
and we are also asking for a full-time
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
land one specialist in our it department
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
because of all the technology that is
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
being used now in the courts
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
the i.t department really feels that
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
being able to support
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh courts across the state
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
is we just don't have the resources in
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
order to do that adequately with the
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
staff they have so they're requesting
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
one more
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
land specialist to make
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
to help people in a more timely manner
 
00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.230 align:start position:0%
to help people in a more timely manner
class

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
11 personal services unclassified is
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
where the full-time judges in both the
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
supreme and the superior
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
port are budgeted you see it actually a
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
reduction of eighteen hundred dollars
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
the judge's salaries have had no
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
increase so it is actually due to
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
a change in the membership of those
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
judges and they have different longevity
 
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.110 align:start position:0%
judges and they have different longevity
amounts

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
newer ones coming in don't have as much
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
longevity as ones who have
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
retired and that's why you see a
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
decrease in that line
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
class excuse me class 12
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
personal services unclassified is where
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
we budget for our senior active status
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
judges and again those are the ones who
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
have not attained the age of 70 but
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
continue to serve they do so on a per
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
diem basis
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
and i've tried to increase that a little
 
00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:41.430 align:start position:0%
and i've tried to increase that a little
bit

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
to reflect what i project will be the
 
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.110 align:start position:0%
to reflect what i project will be the
need

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
for senior active status judges in the
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
superior court the supreme court does
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
and we're also anticipating some backlog
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
that may need to be um
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
addressed in 22 as well so i
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
put a little bit more in just to cover
 
00:33:01.279 --> 00:33:03.190 align:start position:0%
put a little bit more in just to cover
that

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
class 18 is overtime and again i'm just
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
increase that budget a little bit to
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate overtime needs to deal with
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
class 20 is current expense and i've
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
adjusted those numbers a bit to better
 
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:19.990 align:start position:0%
adjusted those numbers a bit to better
reflect

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
reflect
 
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.269 align:start position:0%
reflect
actuals

00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
for 20 in that we saw in fiscal year
 
00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:27.909 align:start position:0%
for 20 in that we saw in fiscal year
2020

00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
2020
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm projecting fiscal year 2021 to
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
be 700 000
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
um i mean we're three-quarters into the
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so i have a better sense of
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
where our expenses are heading
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
so i increased it a little bit over and
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
above that for
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
22 and 23. class 22
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
is our rents and leases and the
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
increases there reflect
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
an increase in our rental space at one
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
granite place
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
and we also are now leasing our
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
multi-function copiers they're no longer
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
just copiers they they scan they
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
you can print you can send things to
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
other people through them i believe
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
and we went to a model instead of
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
purchasing them we now lease them
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
because the technology keeps changing
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
and we just cannot keep up with it it
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to actually purchase
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
these things and deal with ever-changing
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
technology so
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
we went to a leasing model and what
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
we've done in 22 is we've added
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
15 more leases to address other courts
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
whose copiers are going to be at end of
 
00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:27.750 align:start position:0%
whose copiers are going to be at end of
life

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
and then in fiscal year 23 we've added
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
an additional
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
eight leases for those courts that whose
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
copiers are going to be at end of life
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
that should complete the leasing for all
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
of our courts at that point
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
i think you're going to be entering into
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
a three-year leasing contract fairly
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
soon our leases
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
are expiring and so those numbers should
 
00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:50.310 align:start position:0%
are expiring and so those numbers should
stabilize

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
stabilize
 
00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
class 24 is maintenance other than
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
buildings and grounds
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
and that's maintenance for the vehicles
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
that we own
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
other office maintenance that we may
 
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:01.750 align:start position:0%
other office maintenance that we may
have

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
and i've increased that a little bit one
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
of the problems with this is can be a
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
little unpredictable when a part goes on
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
a car
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
we need that vehicle in operation so we
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
have to fix it so
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
we also have a snowblower at the supreme
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
court those types of things
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's all these little things that will
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes break down that we need to
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
make sure we have the funding for to
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
keep these things
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
operational class 26 is organ
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
organizational dues excuse me
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
the vast bulk of that is our dues
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
payment to the national center for state
 
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.190 align:start position:0%
payment to the national center for state
courts

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
we have also added seven thousand
 
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
dollars in each of fiscal year 22 and 23
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
for a contract with the national center
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
for state courts for a language
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
for a language access and that is uh
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
geared toward making um
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
non-english-speaking people
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
class 27 is transfers to department of
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
information technology
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's probably going to go up a little
 
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
bit donna we discovered that
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
doit failed to put cyber security
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
insurance in their class 27 and instead
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
they budgeted it straight in
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
das which was fine but did for 600 000
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
das had to cut several staff in order to
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
cover that
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
so that's now going to be distributed
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
out across every agency it's going to be
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
minor but you will see an errata sheet
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
and just so you know when you get it you
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
won't have to come back i just want to
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
let you know
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
okay it may not impact us you see the
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
number is 80
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
now i don't know it won't impact you
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a slight increase so
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
when you guys look at your budget and
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
think what the heck happened
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's just being taken care of because
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
everybody does need the cyber security
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
insurance i mean we can't build that
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we have our own cyber security
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
yeah program
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay you're actually covered by this
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
insurance as well you have your own
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
program but this insurance i understand
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
helps you clean up uh protect you if you
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
get sued
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
after something there is a break
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
whatever every agency is covered so
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
when you see a little bit of an increase
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
i just want you to know why
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you class 30 equipment
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
the increase there is in fiscal year 22
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
and that is excuse me to provide
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
new furniture for belknap superior court
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
and also a little bit for video
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
conferencing equipment video
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
conferencing equipment
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
reaches end of life as well and so we
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
typically budget
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
for one courthouse to have its video
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
conferencing equipment
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
class 38 technology software that is for
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh the law library it utilizes two
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
software applications
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
it provides electronic access and
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
cataloging services
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
and those are their contracts and they
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
go up every year
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
the law library has tried to mitigate
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
those increases as much as it can
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
by doing a longer term contract so i
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
think they try to negotiate three-year
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
contracts at this point the rates get a
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
little bit lower but
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
despite that those rates are not fixed
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
for those three years they still
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
continue to go up each year built
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
that right now and we'll see what comes
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
with additional funding um
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
we are incurring approximately twelve
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month in additional
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
telecom for our open voice so the
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
circuit court primarily
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
is conducting hearings remotely so
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
what's happening is people are calling
 
00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:32.310 align:start position:0%
what's happening is people are calling
in

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
and every person who calls in is charged
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
the same amount so it sounds like it's a
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
really great rate but when you have 10
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
or 12 people on that call
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
for every minute they're on there it
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
really racks up so
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
the baseline cost is about 9 500 but the
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
the tax on that has increased
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
significantly it
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
increases every quarter it's now 31.8
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
percent of it so that's why
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
the cost itself is quite high uh prior
 
00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.230 align:start position:0%
the cost itself is quite high uh prior
to

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
january one we were actually charging
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
that to some cares act funding that we
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
were able to receive from gopher
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
but i was instructed that we could not
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
use any surplus that we had
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
in that funding after december 30. so
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
i just anticipated i think all the cares
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
funny had to be spent by that
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
time or else i thought the feds extended
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
it but i
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
no oh all right but anyways and who
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
knows what you're getting in the latest
 
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
thing i mean i'm just trying to read the
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
latest bill that passed
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we won't we won't talk about
 
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:29.829 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we won't we won't talk about
that

00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
all right so hopefully that will not
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
come to
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
reality in terms of hitting our general
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
fund budget but the courts do need to
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
continue to operate and
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
process the the backflow of cases as
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
well so
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's why we put it in there indirect
 
00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:43.990 align:start position:0%
that's why we put it in there indirect
costs

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
again that is just um a calculation of
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
where we will pay the indirect costs
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
that are associated with any federal
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
grants that we work on the number is
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
small we don't have a lot of federal
 
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.109 align:start position:0%
small we don't have a lot of federal
grants

00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
grants
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
but our accounting unit 1880 is where we
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
have our administrative costs budgeted
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
and that's where we post
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
class 46 consultants we've added
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit of money seventy thousand
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
dollars for an it consultant for
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
software integration
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh ninety seven thousand for network for
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
a network
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
security consultant and fifty thousand
 
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.710 align:start position:0%
security consultant and fifty thousand
dollars

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
for mitigation of documents
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
in the supreme court that are uh molding
 
00:40:31.359 --> 00:40:31.670 align:start position:0%
in the supreme court that are uh molding
and

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
what's new in there the 70 000 is the um
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
net impact of hiring network security
 
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.190 align:start position:0%
net impact of hiring network security
consultant

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
um our it team recognized that we were
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
our network was vulnerable
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
and so we are really shoring that up we
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
hire a consultant who comes in and does
 
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.550 align:start position:0%
hire a consultant who comes in and does
audits

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
audits
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
i think once a quarter and we are
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
continually improving
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that our data and our
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
40 class 48 contractual maintenance
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
buildings and grounds
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
donna why don't you just hit the ones
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
that have an increase
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay or rather even a significant can
 
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:13.990 align:start position:0%
okay or rather even a significant can
increase

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
plus 49 that's um bureau of facilities
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
that number comes from them but that is
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
what they estimate before our buildings
 
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.750 align:start position:0%
what they estimate before our buildings
um

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
let's see class 50 goes down for example
 
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.390 align:start position:0%
let's see class 50 goes down for example
so

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's because we converted part-time
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
positions to full-time so you'll see
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
reduction there
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
that is a big reduction for the number
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
of part-time people one of them was the
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
labor grade 60 step nine they were very
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
high that's why you see that number so
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
big for the number of
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
part-time reductions um benefits
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
it follows the salaries and also our
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
judicial so not only
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
is nhrs retirement in that benefits line
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
but also judicial retirement plan
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
benefits for our judges
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
is in that line it increased excuse me
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
from 69.4
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
in 20 and 21 to 77.6
 
00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
and 22.23 and that is based on an
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
actuarial analysis to project
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
what contribution would need to be made
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any other questions on
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 1880 a lot of those
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
other ones are reductions you see a 200
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
000 reduction in class 73 grants that is
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
drug court that is sullivan county not
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
participating in our drug court program
 
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:25.589 align:start position:0%
participating in our drug court program
so

00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions on accounting unit
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
1880 otherwise i will continue i don't
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
see anybody has any questions at the
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
moment so we'll i will
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
come on flip the page okay
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit excuse me is
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
1995 mediation and arbitration funds
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
and this program funds paid mediation
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
and arbitration
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
and supports operation of the program we
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
have one
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh clerical staff one full-time person
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
and this uses no general funds no
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
general funds at all no all right
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's yeah right okay it's a surcharge
 
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.030 align:start position:0%
it's yeah right okay it's a surcharge
from

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
various filings that people do but then
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
we get to
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
judge king's area and now we're going to
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
use general funds
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
so moving on to um accounting unit 8670
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
again we see an impact from the position
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
adjustments i don't know if you've had a
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
chance to read the letter but
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
the circuit court throughout fiscal year
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 has been
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
um carefully managing its positions but
 
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.190 align:start position:0%
um carefully managing its positions but
um

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
changing some part-time positions to
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
full-time positions you have
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
judge king don't you have a section in
 
00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:42.630 align:start position:0%
judge king don't you have a section in
hb2

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
wait a minute sometimes i have
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
nightmares in the middle of the night
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
section 16 which is on
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
well starts at the bottom of page eight
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
so of course the verb reaches on page
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
nine so
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
says for the biennium ending june 30th
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
2023 the number of judges serving on
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
oh this is superior court i'm sorry this
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
is tina's
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
never mind my mistake judge king will
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
get tina when she gets
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
when she gets there so she can talk to
 
00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:37.109 align:start position:0%
when she gets there so she can talk to
that

00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay please continue yes and class 10 is
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
the clerical
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
staff class 11 excuse me are
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
full-time judges and per diem judges
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
and this is the net impact of adding
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
two additional full-time circuit court
 
00:44:53.599 --> 00:44:54.069 align:start position:0%
two additional full-time circuit court
judges

00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
judges
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
again from our current staffing of 35 to
 
00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:57.910 align:start position:0%
again from our current staffing of 35 to
37

00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
37
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
as we discussed and also the
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
impact of longevity and
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
reduced and adjusted for the per diem
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
judges who also are funded out of this
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
class line
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh cost 12 has no variance to it
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
class 16 is where we budget for the
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
marital masters they have different
 
00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.589 align:start position:0%
marital masters they have different
longevities

00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
longevities
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
now they've got an additional 300 in
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
each year
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
um the the next large line
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
would be class 60 benefits and again
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
it follows salary and the jr the
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
judicial retirement plan rate increase
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
and uh interpreter services i put extra
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
money in there we never seem to have
 
00:45:45.359 --> 00:45:45.750 align:start position:0%
money in there we never seem to have
enough

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
we never budgeted enough money for our
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
interpreter services costs i think
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
part of it is the the services
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of it increases as well and the
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
number of people probably needing
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
the service anyone have any other
 
00:45:59.599 --> 00:45:59.990 align:start position:0%
the service anyone have any other
questions

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
on circuit court budget seeing none
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
the next um accounting unit is
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 1736 which is the i.t
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund which i think you are
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
well acquainted with and i just wanted
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
to note how
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
thankful and appreciative we are of the
 
00:46:21.119 --> 00:46:22.390 align:start position:0%
thankful and appreciative we are of the
legislature

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
funding our operations in fiscal year 20
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
and 21
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation it has been
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
so helpful to us
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
well as i as i've said a number of times
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
this was not
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
intended to fund everything but we were
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
at a point where
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
at the time a former chief justice
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
would take all the computer money in
 
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:43.990 align:start position:0%
would take all the computer money in
this

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
in your branch and turn it into books or
 
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.230 align:start position:0%
in your branch and turn it into books or
something

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to see you guys modernized
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
and you have so it's
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's well worth the expense to bring
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
ease to some of the residents
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes so the way i budget for
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
this line is class 37 technology
 
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:03.829 align:start position:0%
this line is class 37 technology
hardware

00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
hardware
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
we use for the generally funded portion
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
of that budget
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
and class 38 is the truly dedicated
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
portion of that budget each year we file
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
an annual report of the it dedicated
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
funds which gives a much more
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
detailed explanation of how we use those
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:25.510 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
and the next accounting unit is court
 
00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:32.230 align:start position:0%
and the next accounting unit is court
security

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
and there aren't too many uh big changes
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
there but i do want to point out with
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
closed for so long how has that
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
impacted what you're actually paying out
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
well i'd like to say the courts were
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
never really closed we
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
limited access by the public in person
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
but we continue to operate on obviously
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
switching to
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
remote methods to do that we have seen
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
reductions in certain areas of our
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
budget obviously in jury trials
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen it so that's what we pay to
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
our jurors to show up
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
for um jury duty that has seen a big
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
decrease some we've seen decreases in
 
00:48:14.319 --> 00:48:15.750 align:start position:0%
decrease some we've seen decreases in
travel

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
travel
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
um so it has it has impacted our budget
 
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.349 align:start position:0%
um so it has it has impacted our budget
favorably

00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
favorably
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh robert mr keating you can
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not speak from there you
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
do not have a microphone
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
you can move up here and share the
 
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.630 align:start position:0%
you can move up here and share the
microphone

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
um you can use
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative leishman's microphone you
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
have to turn on thank you
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
we aren't we aren't miked for every seat
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
in the room i apologize but we've done
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
the best we can
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
we have this wonderful equipment that
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
cleans the air five times an hour
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
one up here and one back there so we
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
feel really
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
nice and safe in here besides the fact
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
we've all been

i just wanted to add that the courts
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
open this entire time and judge king had
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
to close
 
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
franklin for a day just because we ran
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
out of staff
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
because of a bit of a covet scare but
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
they've been open and in fact the court
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
security officers
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
have really stepped up during the
 
00:49:30.079 --> 00:49:30.950 align:start position:0%
have really stepped up during the
pandemic

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
and have done yeoman's work greeting
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
people at the front doors
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
and carrying out the kind of screening
 
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:38.950 align:start position:0%
and carrying out the kind of screening
activities

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
that are happening in this building and
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
engaging with people coming into the
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
courthouse taking our temperatures when
 
00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.030 align:start position:0%
courthouse taking our temperatures when
these

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
facts prove that you don't necessarily
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
run a fever when you have the disease
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
i think that's a wonderful waste of man
 
00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.589 align:start position:0%
i think that's a wonderful waste of man
time

00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
well and when people come in scientific
 
00:49:58.079 --> 00:50:00.870 align:start position:0%
well and when people come in scientific
facts

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
right sorry madam chair but when people
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
come in
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
needing to address their legal issues um
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
we have the court security officers out
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
front sorting through that and deciding
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
who can come through
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
and who can be taken care of just at the
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
front there and so they're faring papers
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
and not bringing people right into the
 
00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.470 align:start position:0%
and not bringing people right into the
court

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh clerks area or the courtroom and then
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
we're operating hearings on a daily
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
basis and
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
and actually holding in-person hearings
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
we've been we've been open and
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
security's been provided
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
during that whole time so that's why our
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
expenditures have been high
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
through the period okay thank you
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
this budget also reflects a recommended
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
10 increase in the per diem rate of pay
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
for our court security officers and
 
00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.510 align:start position:0%
for our court security officers and
concurrently

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
concurrently
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
for sheriff's bailiffs in our superior
 
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:56.710 align:start position:0%
for sheriff's bailiffs in our superior
courts

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
it is not in the collect is a
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation right now i do not
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
believe it's in the collective
 
00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.190 align:start position:0%
believe it's in the collective
bargaining

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
bargaining
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
agreement they are negotiating with the
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
teamsters now are they not
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
but it's not contractual
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know how that language is going
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
to be worded
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
yeah but you've got a budget for current
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.839 --> 00:51:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
have

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
the i think the only stipulation
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh is for the sheriffs which says in
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
chapter law
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
that they shall receive the same rate of
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
pay as our court security officers but
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
our court security officer's rate of pay
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
is negotiated
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
through our collective bargaining so is
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
the question is and i think it's yes or
 
00:51:41.359 --> 00:51:41.829 align:start position:0%
the question is and i think it's yes or
no

00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
is this above what is in your current
 
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.670 align:start position:0%
is this above what is in your current
contract

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes can you please
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
get me a figure for how much above it is
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
beyond your current contract
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
yes i know you don't have it with you
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
but you can get it send it to
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman down at lba please and with
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
copy to me
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
and then the last line would be the
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
sheriff's reimbursement which we just
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
and then we have judicial conduct
 
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:30.549 align:start position:0%
and then we have judicial conduct
committee

00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
which has been active this year yes
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately unfortunately
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
yeah um so i work with
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
um bob middleholzer who is the executive
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
secretary and general counsel
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much flat funded yep for the
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
most yeah
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
it really is and
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
we have court accounting unit 2722 the
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
court improvement project
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
which again is representative of our
 
00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.430 align:start position:0%
which again is representative of our
federal

00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
grants that we have i will note that we
 
00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:03.349 align:start position:0%
grants that we have i will note that we
are

00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
starting to pursue more actively federal
 
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:06.870 align:start position:0%
starting to pursue more actively federal
funding

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
um because we are concerned that there
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
may be federal funds that we're leaving
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
on the table
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
so we're we're having internal
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
discussions about that and what it may
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
take to
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
operate more grant programs within the
 
00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
organization that has
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
not been our focus in the past and we
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that if we do
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
proceed down this path that we not only
 
00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:27.750 align:start position:0%
proceed down this path that we not only
write

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
write
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
good grants but that we are also
 
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:30.950 align:start position:0%
good grants but that we are also
managing

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
managing
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
any funding that we do receive there are
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
lots of terms and conditions that you
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
have to meet the requirements yeah
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good idea um
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
i think we support that now i want to
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
tina if you can unmute yourself and i
 
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.230 align:start position:0%
tina if you can unmute yourself and i
told

we have served 971 participants since
 
00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:16.230 align:start position:0%
we have served 971 participants since
you

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
authorized statewide funding 345 of them
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
have graduated and 314 are still in a
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
certain phases of the
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the program you know it takes between
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
one and two years to complete
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
we have actually started working on a
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
recidivism study so we are we were able
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
to obtain
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
a statewide database system so that all
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
the courts are collecting the same data
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
once we have all that information from
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
2016 on migrated we'll be able to pick a
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
comparison group and do a recidivism
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
study so
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
things are going well the teams are
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
getting great training
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
and they are following best practices
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
which was our goal we did have a
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
national association
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
come in and do a research project to
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
make sure they were following
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices and we made
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
adjustments in certain courts that
 
00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:05.430 align:start position:0%
adjustments in certain courts that
needed

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
some improvements here and there so
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's just sort of the overall i'm
 
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:09.349 align:start position:0%
that's just sort of the overall i'm
happy

00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
happy
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
even i know you have a lot to get
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
through today so if anyone has any
 
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.030 align:start position:0%
through today so if anyone has any
questions

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
later or offline i'm happy to go into
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
more detail
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
the one issue that we discussed amongst
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves it was actually
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
prompted by chief justice mcdonald got
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
me thinking a little bit more about
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
how we should take this step as you
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
heard from donna
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
the sullivan county has decided they
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to operate a drug court
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
we've worked with them we've tried to
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
encourage them we've
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
met with the county attorney there and
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't want to force it on
 
00:55:40.079 --> 00:55:40.710 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't want to force it on
anyone

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
and and so we figured we would give that
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
some time it's been since 2016
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
and we thought maybe one approach would
 
00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.589 align:start position:0%
and we thought maybe one approach would
be

00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
to use that money somehow and i would i
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
would want your input on that
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative ober
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
to either spread it out amongst the
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
other counties or to focus that money on
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
the smaller counties because they have a
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
smaller amount of money
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
but somehow to improve the programming
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
in other counties we have not
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
seen an increase in funding for the drug
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
courts since
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
you first authorized it and not even a
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
cost of living increase
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
so that was just one thought but i'm
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about other ideas you
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
might have
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
and happy to answer any questions
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative walsh you have your hand
 
00:56:23.119 --> 00:56:25.829 align:start position:0%
representative walsh you have your hand
up

00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
i do thank you so tina i think you were
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
on the committee with me that looked at
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
expanding the drug courts to basically
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
include mental health courts
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i while i've not followed as closely
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
as i should i know that bill is moving
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
through the house
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
but my finance question to you is if
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
passes do you need additional funding to
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
implement that or
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
is the systems you've got in place
 
00:56:48.319 --> 00:56:50.309 align:start position:0%
is the systems you've got in place
adequate

00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
so the bill that is going through the
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
house i think there may be a
 
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.510 align:start position:0%
house i think there may be a
recommendation

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
for it to be an expedient to legislate
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
was simply to
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
have the chief justice of the supreme
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
court provide a report that issues
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
what kind of standards should we follow
 
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
for mental health courts
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
and um even if it doesn't pass we are
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
working on creating some standards so
 
00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:11.990 align:start position:0%
working on creating some standards so
before

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
we would even bridge that question about
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
funding but certainly
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
um there are i think about 16 mental
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
health courts operating through the
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
circuit court right now there are
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
maybe two or three programs in superior
 
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:25.670 align:start position:0%
maybe two or three programs in superior
court

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
their their focus is a little different
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
than the drug court
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
so the idea would be to have a
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
coordinator that would work with our
 
00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.030 align:start position:0%
coordinator that would work with our
overall

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
office to um coordinate with the mental
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
health courts
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
certainly people in drug court have
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
mental health issues and they are
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
treated at the same time
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
and the circuit court programs focus
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
mostly on people with
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
that have a major their their major
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
issue is significant mental health
 
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:50.789 align:start position:0%
issue is significant mental health
issues

00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
and they continually get rearrested for
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
those kind of low-level crimes so
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
i think the first step is develop
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
standards and then what kind of funding
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
we would need would be
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
much farther down the road do you have a
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up mary beth
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
i don't thank you for that because i
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
just wondered how it
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
impacted you financially that clarifies
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
and by the way let me say i didn't
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
realize the bill was itl apparently in
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
committee i'm sorry to hear that
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
well it was that that's the
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation i think it was a very
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
close call so we'll see what happens on
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
the house floor but
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that judge king and i
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
are are going to work on standards
 
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.069 align:start position:0%
are are going to work on standards
anyway

00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's good to hear that thank you well if
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
the bill was
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
for working on standards you really
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
don't need
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
us to tell you to work on standards i
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
think you guys know how to do that
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
gordon tina and i have these ongoing
 
00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.230 align:start position:0%
gordon tina and i have these ongoing
conversations

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how many
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
years it's been tina may know since i
 
00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:53.190 align:start position:0%
years it's been tina may know since i
was

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
chairing the committee that was working
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
on how to fund the drug courts
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
which was in finance and turned out to
 
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.349 align:start position:0%
which was in finance and turned out to
be

00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of people because it was a
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
combination not only of division one
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
but members from division three as well
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
because there were impacts into that
 
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:13.510 align:start position:0%
because there were impacts into that
area

00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
we had a little trouble just getting
 
00:59:15.839 --> 00:59:16.549 align:start position:0%
we had a little trouble just getting
started

00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
tina and i don't need to go through all
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
that but we
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
we did have some fits and starts not
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure we were going to get it passed but
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
we did
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
yes you were instrumental for sure one
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
of the things we did not do
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
hindsight's a wonderful thing so okay
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
let's start with that
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
we were just concentrating on how to get
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
the stupid thing going how to get it
 
00:59:39.599 --> 00:59:40.789 align:start position:0%
the stupid thing going how to get it
funded

00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
we thought it would make a difference we
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
never gave any consideration to
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
five years down the line six years down
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
the line all the costs will go up and
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
the money will be the same
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
so i had suggested to tina before the
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit
 
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then of course this summer we were
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
all someplace else so we never could get
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
together and work on it
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
but that we do a modification to the
 
01:00:03.359 --> 01:00:04.390 align:start position:0%
but that we do a modification to the
funding

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
and at least add in a cpi
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
funding so the drug court money
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
continues to go up i still think that's
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
the way to do it
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to take money that
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
might have been used in a county that
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't want it
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
and put it out yeah so i'm um
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
i would like to work with you and tina
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
and get that bill filed in the fall
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
and make that happen rather than try to
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
deal with that here
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
that would be my preference okay that
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
makes total sense
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
that said house finance house ways and
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
means passes revenue estimates it tells
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
us what
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
we may spend in finance so that's
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
basically the first step of the budget
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
that was voted on in the floor of the
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
house when we met
 
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
at the bedford sports arena and
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
house ways and means voted unanimously
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
i respect them greatly i don't know how
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
to decide what revenues have but clearly
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
my role is spending the money
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
my husband sits on house ways and means
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
so you can imagine we have interesting
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
dinner conversations about i need more
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
money and he's like cut
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
yeah okay it's the same reason i don't
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
drive a ferrari because he and i have
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
those conversations at dinner and the
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
money just never shows up
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
but we the house
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
has to cut a minimum of 49 million
 
01:01:26.319 --> 01:01:27.829 align:start position:0%
has to cut a minimum of 49 million
dollars

01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
if we use rainy day funds to manage
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
whatever overspending we have for this
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
year we are clearly moving out of the
 
01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.789 align:start position:0%
year we are clearly moving out of the
pandemic

01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
covet is going to be endemic the thing
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
i'm looking forward to most
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
is not being tested every four days by
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
my employer
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah i'm covered free but you know
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'm tired of being tested
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
that's hard i am not going to cut your
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
budget i have worked out the division 1
 
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.710 align:start position:0%
budget i have worked out the division 1
share

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
share
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
of cutting the budget and your budget is
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
going to pass
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think i can add on the money
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
tina wants for the drug courts i
 
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.230 align:start position:0%
tina wants for the drug courts i
apologize

01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
but you're basically going to get your
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
budget through here
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
without any additional cuts
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of where i am but i
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
would like to work on getting
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
increased funding for drug courts what
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
we did is not sustainable year after
 
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.430 align:start position:0%
we did is not sustainable year after
year

01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that madam chair and and uh
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
justice nato and i will
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
will engage with you and and figure out
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
a way to get it on a sustainable
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
um glad path going forward okay really
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
important program and
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your your work and
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
getting it off the ground
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
now you have to promise to tell jane la
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
jane young we ripped you over the colts
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
and you had to give up lots and it was
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
difficult because otherwise you're going
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair i just want to say i'd like
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
to co-sponsor that bill with you on the
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
drug courts i'd be happy to work with

01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you mary beth i
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
well i heard lambs and slaughter may go
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
back to that
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
and knowing how discerning the chair and
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
the other members of the division are i
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
can't believe you bought that for one
 
01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.870 align:start position:0%
can't believe you bought that for one
minute

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
yeah no she did start she was so funny
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
she did a really good job and she
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
started here and she said you know he
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
could have waited one more week and i
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
feel like i'm
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
a lamb going to slaughter here but she
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
did a good job
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
yeah they're getting all the positions
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
you put in i have had to push the start
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
dates a little bit
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh we haven't seen those amendments yet
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
but you're going to get your position so
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
your budget basically is going to pass
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
unscathed as well from where you left my
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
former that is the budget i did build
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
that is the budget you did bill i know
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
well i thank you madam chair and i thank
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
members of the division and
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
and we do have our letter and if there
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
are any questions at all i you know how
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
to find them
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
let me ask tina about this section tina
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
section 36
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
i mean section 16 the superior court
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
the number of judges serving on the
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
superior court shall not exceed 22 and
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
the number of full-time judges
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
shall not exceed 35.
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
yeah but then it says relative to
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
conversion of the position of marital
 
01:04:10.559 --> 01:04:11.430 align:start position:0%
conversion of the position of marital
masters

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
masters
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
to full-time judicial positions this is
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
hereby suspended do you need that
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
so here that oh that is judge
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
yes judge king so i that's been in the
 
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:25.589 align:start position:0%
yes judge king so i that's been in the
last

01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
several weeks i know i'm trying to fight
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
after you need it we have it again we
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
have to approve or disapprove all these
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
sections respectfully ask you to take it
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
out because my interpretation of that is
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
if one of our remaining two marital
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
masters retires we can't replace them
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
with a judge which we would need to do
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
so take it out that would be my
 
01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.230 align:start position:0%
so take it out that would be my
preference

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
preference
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay i can do that then
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
donna is you transfer among classes
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
we have not approved that either
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
that is helpful language um you try to
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
be respectful though
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
of salary and benefit appropriation
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
even versus other language would give me
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to transfer
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i think it also increases the limit
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
to a hundred thousand dollars i believe
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
in statute it still remains itself i did
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
pass a bill that i failed to put
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
judicial branch in to increase the limit
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
so that was my fault but yes that
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
that bill passed oh representative
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%

leishman has joined us with his broken
wrist

01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
wrist
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay so you need that yes
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
section 18 before you guys go i'm sorry
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
gordon you have your
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
do you have a question on 17 before
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
leave it no but i wanted
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
addressed section 16. okay address
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
section 16 please
 
01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
the uh the number in section 16 with
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
respect to the circuit court
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
is 35 it needs to be increased to 37.
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
but if i delete that as judge king said
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
you have funded 37 do i need that in
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
there or
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
now this is a question are you
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
authorized 45 positions but some of them
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
are unfunded
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
yes so if i delete this section you're
 
01:06:16.799 --> 01:06:17.670 align:start position:0%
yes so if i delete this section you're
37

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
37
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
oh i misunderstood you're going to
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
delete the entire well that's what i
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
is that what i heard you'd ask me to do
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
what i was asking
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
is the section that refers to marital
 
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.950 align:start position:0%
is the section that refers to marital
masters

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
masters
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
would be such that if a marital master
 
01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.789 align:start position:0%
would be such that if a marital master
retired

01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
that current language would prevent us
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
from filling it with a judge
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
and that was done a few years ago and
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's been carried over just as a cost
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
saving measure but we would like to take
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
that out so that if
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
one of our two remaining marital masters
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
retired we would be able to ask
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
that position to be filled with the
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
judge but we do need 37
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
cap in house but wait a minute i have a
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
brain bear with me
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
gordon you told me you have
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
authorization for 45 circuit court
 
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.990 align:start position:0%
authorization for 45 circuit court
positions

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
35 were funded but you added funding for
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
two more
 
01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
so you're still authorized for 45
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
positions with 37 funded are you not
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
we are authorized for 45 but there's
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
been a cap in hb2
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
but if i take this section completely
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
out then we would be fine
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
then you would be fine so my plan was to
 
01:07:30.559 --> 01:07:31.510 align:start position:0%
then you would be fine so my plan was to
delete

01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
delete
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
get an amendment to delete
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
section 16 in its entirety
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
that works i i misunderstood your
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
colloquy i thought we were just talking
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
about the marital
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
master language i i read the head the
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
olive and then i okay i got
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
and mr hoffman you hear that we need an
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
amendment to delete section
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
16 and hb2 okay now
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
let us move to the last section you guys
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
have here that i know of
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
section 18 the judicial branch
 
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of sheriff's office for
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%

01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
the state shall reimburse the sheriff's
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
office for court security
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
at the rates provided in the collective
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement agreement
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
applicable to per diem court security
 
01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.709 align:start position:0%
applicable to per diem court security
officers

01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
officers
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
that sounded fine to me we haven't
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
approved it yet
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay so now you really are done oh
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative emerick has i'm
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
sorry you're not done representative
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
emerick is going to get out
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
these are not budgetary questions these
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
are issues we're dealing with here
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the issues uh has to
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
do with the affiliation of the parole
 
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.030 align:start position:0%
do with the affiliation of the parole
board

01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
right the parole board is currently
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
married to the department of corrections
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
i i'm i have no position on that i think
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's better directed to
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
ols is researching that and they have a
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
phone call
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
monday morning with somebody high up in
 
01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.829 align:start position:0%
monday morning with somebody high up in
the

01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
architecture of parole boards for the
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
okay i'll move on to my next measurement
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
two terms ago uh the chair and i visited
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
and it got a presentation about the
 
01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:38.390 align:start position:0%
and it got a presentation about the
probate

01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
probate
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
system when it was being automated it
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
was very impressive
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
well when the program i believe was
 
01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:45.910 align:start position:0%
well when the program i believe was
probate

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
probate
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
and they've continued since you've been
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
out right superior
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
so i i i i wasn't around i just wonder
 
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:52.950 align:start position:0%
so i i i i wasn't around i just wonder
what

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
additional strategies you're going to
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
employ electronically because there was
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
a plan
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
it seemed like we were doing it in
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
chunks big chunks and i just wonder what
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
what what's the next
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
big chunk or what are you working on now
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
okay i think it's
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
very impressive very superior court is
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
up aren't
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
tina aren't you guys up electronically
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
now with the e court
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
chief is it okay if i answer this or yes
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
when i don't see you um yes we the
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
is fully electronic in civil and in
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
criminal case types which
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
ironically helped us in the pandemic we
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
are now
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
working on a project to bring digital
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
evidence management to the courtroom so
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
that the lawyers when we first rolled
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
out ecorp were wondering well what about
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
my paper documents and my photographs
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
and my videos what do i do with that
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
so our next project in the ecorp project
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
is to roll out a digital evidence
 
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.590 align:start position:0%
is to roll out a digital evidence
management

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
product um circuit court did a whole
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
bunch of the sort of lead work with
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
small claims and wills and trusts
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
and worked out a lot of the kinks for us
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
so it helped us get
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
civil and criminal up and running we
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
have a smaller operation so it was
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
easier so the next piece is to complete
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
that by
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
bringing on digital evidence management
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's the next step
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you one more one more
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
there's a another issue that we're
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with called sheriffs
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
and transportation of inmates
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
and right now that budget line is in the
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
they come before us and we say what
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
about this budget line
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
and they say we we're unfair to
 
01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.270 align:start position:0%
and they say we we're unfair to
everybody

01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
but we don't know how to manage this we
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
don't know how to take care of them
 
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
and so we're struggling right now with
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
how to how to how the reimbursements to
 
01:11:51.199 --> 01:11:51.750 align:start position:0%
how to how to how the reimbursements to
sheriffs

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
sheriffs
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
you seem to do a lot with sheriffs what
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to do is get you to take this
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
i can tell you former former supreme
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
court justice
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
before fred before bob lynn
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
i tried to do that i was six feet tall
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
at the time i'm now five
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
six so it was not well received
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
and this was not even at the requested
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
administrative services it just
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
when we got to that point of the budget
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
they they said
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
all we do is write checks i mean they
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
they really have no authority they have
 
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:28.390 align:start position:0%
they really have no authority they have
no

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
involvement they're just a an
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
administrative check writer
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
and they don't have enough money so they
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
make disbursements until the money runs
 
01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:37.750 align:start position:0%
make disbursements until the money runs
out

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
and they would like you to take it over
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
and tracy would like you to take it over
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
and we've asked before and i think you
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
guys have told us
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
i know you guys have told us no i think
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
it was called pound sand
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry we kind of have the same
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
problem because they are not our
 
01:13:00.239 --> 01:13:01.270 align:start position:0%
problem because they are not our
employees

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
we have the same problem of making sure
 
01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:04.310 align:start position:0%
we have the same problem of making sure
we're

01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
keeping track of their time so the court
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
system pays
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
for their security in the courtroom and
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
das pays for their transportation
 
01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.669 align:start position:0%
das pays for their transportation
services

01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
um you know unlike our court security
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
officers which are our
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
court judicial branch employees the
 
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:20.550 align:start position:0%
court judicial branch employees the
sheriff's

01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
sheriff's
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
deputies who provide security in the
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
are sheriff employees and then we
 
01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
immerse them reimburse them for the time
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
they're there so we have kind of a
 
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.590 align:start position:0%
they're there so we have kind of a
similar

01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
challenge we've worked really well with
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
them because of your
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
insistence rep over over the past budget
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
cycle to get them
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
and us on the same page about what are
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
the actual costs so we've had to work
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
very closely with them
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
donna went around and met with every
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
single sheriff's department to figure
 
01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.030 align:start position:0%
single sheriff's department to figure
out

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
all right let's make sure we tighten up
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
this budget so we kind of have the same
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
problem but donna is incredibly on top
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
of it from our end at least
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
the other the other observation i've had
 
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative is
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
what is the function sort of at a
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional point of view of
 
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.590 align:start position:0%
constitutional point of view of
transporting

01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
transporting
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
prisoners and i i don't i would have
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
great hesitancy to say that that is a
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
judicial branch function
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
certainly when they're in our facility
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
we work with the sheriffs to provide
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
safety and security when they're there
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
but actually getting them there i think
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
is more of an executive branch function
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
so this this ping-pong ball is going to
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
keep bouncing around for a while
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
it just see it seems like the sheriff's
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
is an archipelago of unmanaged
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
i mean every everybody's writing checks
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
but nobody's in charge
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
i did have to deal with this issue
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
myself and what sorry and what i ended
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
up doing a few years ago when the
 
01:14:42.159 --> 01:14:42.870 align:start position:0%
up doing a few years ago when the
contract

01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
um the rate for them changed what used
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
to happen is
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
they would send to the judicial branch
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
the invoice for both
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
courtroom security as well as custody
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
and control and then we would send the
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
custody control piece over to your
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
report facilities
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
for them to pay i don't know why we got
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
that piece of it because we didn't pay
 
01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.709 align:start position:0%
that piece of it because we didn't pay
it

01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
but when that and it used to be just a
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
very uh high overview of what they were
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
billing us for you know me hours they
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
were working individuals
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
so i completely overhauled our invoice
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
portion i had no control over what view
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
report facilities did
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
but i created a spreadsheet where i
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
could then see how many people
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
were working what days how many full
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
days how many the hours how many full
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
days how many half days
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
so it gave me a much better indication
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
of what type of
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
staffing resources they would provide
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
security resources they were providing
 
01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:30.550 align:start position:0%
security resources they were providing
now

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
that having been said that doesn't mean
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
that they're doing it in the most
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
efficient manner right
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i noticed in um
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
the language
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
here is that the the metric that they're
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
trying to use i believe is population
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that that's the best
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
metric i think it depends on a lot of
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
things um for
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
us for court staffing um is number of
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
judges who are going to be serving in
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
that court the logistics of that port
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes make a difference as well
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
so and could there be a high profile
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
case what i ended up doing
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
was i analyzed the number of uh full
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
days and half days that each county
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
provided in the prior fiscal year to get
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
some kind of a
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
baseline then i some of them charge
 
01:16:10.239 --> 01:16:10.709 align:start position:0%
baseline then i some of them charge
different

01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
benefits they don't all charge the same
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
amount the statute says they can charge
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
benefits that are associated with this
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
work but they don't all do it
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
consistently so i had to incorporate
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
that for the
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
for the sheriff's counties that did
 
01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
charge it so then i got sort of a
 
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
baseline and i knew what percentage each
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
sheriff's county was providing of the
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
whole from the whole amount that we got
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
i backed out an amount as a reserve that
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
was the piece
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
that if one county went over their
 
01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:37.270 align:start position:0%
that if one county went over their
allocation

01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
i could say i'm taking it out of this
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
pot for now if i run out of money in
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the reserve entirely then i'm going
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
to have to go to a county that's go
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
that's running a surplus
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to meet with them and say
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
i gotta take some money out of your
 
01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:49.430 align:start position:0%
i gotta take some money out of your
budget

01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
to cover the other county that's having
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
a shortfall for whatever reason
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
but that reserve again is gonna be used
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
for unexpected things a very high
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
profile case where they need
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
additional security that's what it's
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
meant to do um so that's the way i have
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
tried to manage this but it is
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to some degree i am still
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
writing checks but at least
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
i can track now when they send their
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
invoice and i actually have
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets that track how many full
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
days how many half days so that
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
and we haven't had an issue because of
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
the pandemic where anybody's exceeding
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
their allocation but if i can see trends
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
i project out and i can see if
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to be exceeding
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
their projection i can let them know and
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
their allocation i can let them know and
 
01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.709 align:start position:0%
their allocation i can let them know and
say

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
can we have a discussion about what's
 
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
going on and if somebody does exceed it
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'll need an explanation what's happened
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
what do we need to do because it's going
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
to affect some other county
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
but i have one pot of money to use so
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's how i have managed it
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative hatch you have your hand
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
up for a question yes thank you madam
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
chair and and
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
no i'm glad you asked because that
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's a concern and i think we do have
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
to come up with and i agree mileage that
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
our population makes no sense
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for your very good work
 
01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.070 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for your very good work
in

01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
in allocation could we could you make
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
that information available to us that's
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely why i asked administrators i
 
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to do
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
a total reimbursement to each county and
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
then take your figures
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can come up with a viable
 
01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.149 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can come up with a viable
reasonable

01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
distribution uh factors if madam chair
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
would agree with that
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you that's all whom should i
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
contact to do that
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
um are we getting something
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
what are we getting a summary from you
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
don i don't know what you're going to
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
give us
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be an excel spreadsheet
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
that i would probably need to talk
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
someone through
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
i would love i would i don't think we
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
have time to do that we've got to get
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
this done the next day or two
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
um so i'm going to suggest that you and
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
represent hatch work on that as a
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
possible bill for next year to solve
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
because we unfortunately you guys are
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
here towards the end of the budget
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
hearing i mean we are
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
chunking along here but we are on a
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
house deadline
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
and we have a problem that we've talked
 
01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:57.910 align:start position:0%
and we have a problem that we've talked
on

01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
i've met with you guys a number of times
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
back and forth you've done work i don't
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
think we're going to solve it
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
in a day or two equitably i think
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
that work needs to be done i think
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
represent patch and represent to burge
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
understand and would love to work with
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
you on a possible bill for the fall and
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
see if we can't put this to bed once and
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
for all and come up with an equitable
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
way to do it
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i'm easy to
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
find in my basement
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah so let's do it that way
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions i'm going
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
to take a couple of votes if you want to
 
01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:36.070 align:start position:0%
to take a couple of votes if you want to
stay

01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
stay
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
for them may i just as i'm new to this
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
role madam chair if you will just
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
indulge sure absolutely
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
when you when you when you read the
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
letter um
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
you will see that although i did not
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
build this budget i strongly support the
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
addition of
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
two additional circuit judges i did read
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
it why you what we've been sitting
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
here in fact i believe that a very
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
strong case can be made for
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh two more on top of that given we
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
don't have money for that you're gonna
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
get your two
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
no no and and i i recognize that
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair but i do i do hope that we
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
could engage in an ongoing dialogue
 
01:20:15.679 --> 01:20:16.470 align:start position:0%
could engage in an ongoing dialogue
about

01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate levels of uh of staffing for
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
judicial officers in the in the circuit
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%

01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%

01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
ols and drafting of that amendment i
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
just want to make double sure yeah
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
the this draft amendment was based on a
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
language from the 2015 budget and it
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
does not reference the commission
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
because the commission formed after the
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
um this budget passed
 
01:25:44.149 --> 01:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
that was a subsequent entity uh
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
lakeshore redevelopment planning
 
01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.110 align:start position:0%
lakeshore redevelopment planning
commission

01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
which was to identify development
 
01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.790 align:start position:0%
which was to identify development
alternatives

01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
um and they are still in existence at
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
this time they have a budget
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation but
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
i understood the intent of the amendment
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
was to
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
transfer the authority for sale that's
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
promulgated in house bill 2 from the
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
governor solely back
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
to a legislative input
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
without consulting the commission but i
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
can amend it if that's what you wish
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%

is that correct
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to make sure it
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
protects the commission that was
 
01:26:31.679 --> 01:26:32.629 align:start position:0%
protects the commission that was
established

01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%

governor's budget
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%

01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%

do we have anything outstanding on the
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
justice department budget or have we
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
handled everything for them that is in
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
hb1 i know we have they've asked to have

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
amendment is coming
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
but just from an hb1 perspective are we
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
at a point where we could approve that
 
01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:55.669 align:start position:0%
at a point where we could approve that
budget

01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%

family leave which i know people have
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
shown some interest in doing
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
we did not approve the agricultural
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
markets and food department budget
 
01:35:15.679 --> 01:35:16.470 align:start position:0%

mr huffman do we have any outstanding
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
issues on that i don't remember any
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
in hb one i don't believe we have any
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
outstanding issues we had one um
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%

there
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
is a bit of a
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
problem in division 2 where there's some
 
01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.990 align:start position:0%

lines going into the agency's budget
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%

division two
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%

01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
dollars when the parks are usually
 
01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.030 align:start position:0%
dollars when the parks are usually
funded

01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
from the parks fund so we would be
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
putting general fund dollars into this
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
she would be generating
 
01:44:35.430 --> 01:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
income into the parks fund
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
when i ask for the amendment this is one
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
of the projects i asked to have retained
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
then section 3 is the sum of 347
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to upgrade
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
the hampton rv park and again if you
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
recall she talked to us about the fact
 
01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:53.669 align:start position:0%
recall she talked to us about the fact
that

01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
the service upgrade needs to be done
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
because it
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
the current rvs cannot connect
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
to this older out moded
 
01:45:05.119 --> 01:45:09.030 align:start position:0%
to this older out moded
infrastructure

01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
the fourth section is the sum of 150 000
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of constructing new
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
playgrounds at two state parks
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
the fifth section is the sum of 250 000
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
for design engineering preliminary site
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
work for
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
facility upgrades at the ragged neck
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
picnic area at rye harbor state park so
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
i left
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
i asked mr hoffman for an amendment that
 
01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:37.030 align:start position:0%
i asked mr hoffman for an amendment that
leaves

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
leaves
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
sections two and sections three but
 
01:45:40.239 --> 01:45:41.030 align:start position:0%
sections two and sections three but
deletes

01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
deletes
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
the other three sections this is an
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
expenditure that is
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
well over a million dollars and even
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
those two
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
sections spends approximately a million
 
01:45:53.679 --> 01:45:54.790 align:start position:0%
sections spends approximately a million
dollars

01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
while cutting off close to another
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
of general funds the commissioner does
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
have park
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
funds she could do some of those things
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
within those parks using her park funds
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
without general funds
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
but none of those were in her
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
hb1 budget so i think we can
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
safely we you don't have the amendment
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
in front of you i haven't seen it i
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
asked for it
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
late last night lba is magical but when
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
you ask for things in the middle of the
 
01:46:25.199 --> 01:46:25.750 align:start position:0%
you ask for things in the middle of the
night

01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
night
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily see them right
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
away so i think we could
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
approve the hb1 budget
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
of natural and cultural affairs and we
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
do have a motion
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
on the floor representative wallace i
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question in more
 
01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
detail than you wanted
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
well i'm happy to have that detail madam
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay then the clerk is ready to call the
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
role if you're in favor of approving the
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
natural and cultural resources
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
hb1 budget please say yes when your name
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
madam chairman yes vice chairman yes the
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes representative griffin
 
01:47:10.639 --> 01:47:11.830 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes representative griffin
yes

01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative leitchman yes
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative hatch yes
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
represent walls yes madam chairman the
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
voter 7 nothing it's unanimous
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative emmerich please
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
would these would these fall into the
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
capital budget budgeting process are
 
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:29.590 align:start position:0%
capital budget budgeting process are
they

01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
are not big enough i think they're too
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
small and that's why they come to us
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
for operational money because capital
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
budgets get bonded and then
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
you pay interest over 5 to 10 to 15
 
01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:43.189 align:start position:0%
you pay interest over 5 to 10 to 15
years

01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't seem to me like it makes
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
sense to pay interest on
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
600 000 but i just it just seems to me
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
i mean to have that fort stark project
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
is kind of not explainable
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
and why can't she clean and secure
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
bunker tunnels
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
rooms and entryways from the park fund
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
i've seen that's operational i mean
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's operational that's what that fund
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
is for
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we just don't have enough funding
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
she could also build
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
one playground uh madame chairman
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
yes we just voted on what i mean hb1
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
and then representative emerick jumped
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
to hb2
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay i just want to make sure that we
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
all right guys let's talk about section
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
one let's talk about the elephant in the
 
01:48:54.239 --> 01:48:55.189 align:start position:0%
one let's talk about the elephant in the
room

01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
room
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
section one in hb two
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.239 --> 01:49:11.350 align:start position:0%
 
reimbursement

01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's clear there is interest in working
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
on a better process
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to get that done between now
 
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
and next
 
01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:32.229 align:start position:0%
and next
wednesday

01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
so in the interim we need to at least
 
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.910 align:start position:0%
so in the interim we need to at least
approve

01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
approve
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative emerick moves to approve
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
section one reimbursement of sharon's
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
sheriff's office representative
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%

please uh yes i mean i will vote yes in
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
the affirmative with reservations but
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
because i did the math if you look at
 
01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
the cost the population of costs roughly
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
31 000
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
divided by 1.5 million in the state
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're lucky if we get 2 but i just
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
wanted that for the record
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay madam chairman thank you that's
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
fair i mean
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a difficult
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
situation hillsborough county as
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative leishman i know ends up
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
paying for two court facilities which
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
no other county does so in order for us
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
to transport
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
prisoners for the court you guys have
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
one van for your
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
counties my county has to purchase
 
01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:36.310 align:start position:0%
counties my county has to purchase
maintain

01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
maintain two vans so you got prisoners
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
going one way and one van
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
prisoner's gonna knee one way and
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
another man you guys have got maybe
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
three sheriffs with your van
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
we've got six out so it it's just
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's just no real easy way of doing
 
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
that i would
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
love for uh representative hatcher
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative to burge to really dig
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
into this with
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
donna raymond and the judicial branch
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
and see what they can come up with
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
but there is no 100

01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
section 19 which is representative
 
01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:03.189 align:start position:0%
section 19 which is representative
leishman's

01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
leishman's
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and he is just asked for
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
a correction to the amendment he's got
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to flip the page we're
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to hear
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
we have section 40 but we'll hear that
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
section 42 and section 43
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
section 42 is
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
the suspension of revenue sharing
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
it was this section that got me involved
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
the only thing i can say about doing
 
01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:06.229 align:start position:0%
the only thing i can say about doing
that

01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
is it gave me a great appreciation for
 
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
the websites in the state of new
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire versus
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
the convoluted website of the federal
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
government when you try to find anything
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of suspending this because
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
when we are faced with cutting
 
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
this is a relatively in some ways
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
easy cut because it's not cutting
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
a staff member who's got kids or family
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's not cutting programs for disabled
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
or programs for elderly
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
or cutting the courts so that they can't
 
01:53:42.639 --> 01:53:43.750 align:start position:0%
or cutting the courts so that they can't
process

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
their legal obligations in a timely
 
01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:47.109 align:start position:0%
their legal obligations in a timely
manner

01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
manner
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
however on the other side being a member
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
a town as each of you are i know that
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
that means that the town
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
is not going to have some revenue
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
however the bill that was just passed by
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
and i believe president biden will sign
 
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
into law
 
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
if you look on their website there is a
 
01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:11.430 align:start position:0%
if you look on their website there is a
grant

01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
grant
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
a large grant made to each and
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
every town and city
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
i talked to the governor's budget
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
director about how that might be
 
01:54:22.159 --> 01:54:23.589 align:start position:0%
director about how that might be
distributed

01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i was told that that would be a
 
01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:26.950 align:start position:0%
and i was told that that would be a
direct

01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
direct
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
pass-through grant the money would come
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
the state would immediately pass it
 
01:54:34.159 --> 01:54:35.030 align:start position:0%
the state would immediately pass it
through

01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
to every town and city
 
01:54:40.709 --> 01:54:40.719 align:start position:0%
so there's some good and bad things
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
about that my my town gets some money
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
your town gets the money
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that if you happen to
 
01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:49.510 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that if you happen to
have

01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
a representative in congress or in the
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
national senate
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
that your town got a whole bag full of
 
01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:58.229 align:start position:0%
that your town got a whole bag full of
money

01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:55:01.109 --> 01:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
because i looked at the town of the city
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
of manchester
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
where chris pappas lives they're going
 
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
44 plus million dollars
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
in one lump sum they will be able to
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
spend it between
 
01:55:17.709 --> 01:55:17.719 align:start position:0%
now when it comes in the spring and
 
01:55:17.719 --> 01:55:20.950 align:start position:0%
now when it comes in the spring and
2024.

01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
over on the seacoast where represe
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
congressman custer is who
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
is my congresswoman they're getting huge
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
chunks of money
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
so everybody's town is going to get a
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
lot of money
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
in a way that makes me feel better
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
because i'm going to vote to
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
but i know the towns are going to get
 
01:55:46.229 --> 01:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
some money so if you haven't checked
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
that out
 
01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
on the fed's website i urge you to check
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
out your town
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
this morning i emailed my county
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're getting 80 possible 80 plus
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars there are some little
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
strings there's a little formula in
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
there it's got to be 75
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
of your operating budget i think if i
 
01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
read that correctly but i emailed my
 
01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:07.189 align:start position:0%
read that correctly but i emailed my
county

01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
administrator this morning and said
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
listen guys you have between now and
 
01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:11.510 align:start position:0%
listen guys you have between now and
2024

01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
2024
 
01:56:13.510 --> 01:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
to fill it it's one-time projects what
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
do we need to upgrade at the courthouses
 
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
what do we need to upgrade in our prison
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
what do we need to upgrade in our
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
let's get started so i think each of us
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
should probably check that out and do it
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
i would like a motion to approve section
 
01:56:30.239 --> 01:56:31.350 align:start position:0%
i would like a motion to approve section
42

01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
42
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
the suspension of revenue sharing
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative emerick moves
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative griffin seconds is there
 
01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:39.669 align:start position:0%
representative griffin seconds is there
additional

01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
discussion on this representative
 
01:56:43.589 --> 01:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
leishman please thanks madam chair you
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
did make a good point
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh i think the city of manchester is
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
going to get more money just by itself
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
than the entire revenue sharing for the
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
entire state so
 
01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:56.719 align:start position:0%
i'll be supporting the motion
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh mary beth is waving i think her cell
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
phone at me
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
no i wasn't i'm sorry that was not for
 
01:57:04.639 --> 01:57:06.629 align:start position:0%
no i wasn't i'm sorry that was not for
you

01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
i thought i was missing a smoke signal
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
and something else was going wrong
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
it was a smoke signal but not for you
 
01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:16.990 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:16.990 --> 01:57:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
um representative tubers yeah i'm
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
anxious to look at the website because
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
coast county has 23 unincorporated
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
places and i was wondering how that
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
fits into the formula so i will
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
you could also ask your elected
 
01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.669 align:start position:0%
you could also ask your elected
representative

but i did
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%

01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
section whatever section it is revenue

the clerk votes yes representative
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%

representative hatch now represent walls
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
madam chairman the vote is five nothing
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
it passes
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
five to two the vote is five to two i
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
corrected that
 
01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
oh no four days in a row will kill us
 
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
all could lba help us with section 43
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
which is the liquor commission
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
processing of merchant cards
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
i believe this is a necessary section
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
but if we could just
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
walk through it we haven't talked it
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
they glossed over it quickly yesterday
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
but if we go section by section i'd
 
01:59:03.189 --> 01:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
who's up for that i am madam chair it's
 
01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:07.109 align:start position:0%
who's up for that i am madam chair it's
mike

01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
mike
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
as i understand it um i think one of the
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
other might have been ways and means
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
committee also asked about this section
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the response was that they need this
 
01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.030 align:start position:0%
and the response was that they need this
language

01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the event that there's some sort of
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
disaster that
 
01:59:28.629 --> 01:59:28.639 align:start position:0%
might jeopardize their credit card
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
business so they need to be able to act
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
quickly to maintain
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
their processing of credit cards because
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
percent of their businesses either
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
i think the interesting thing in section
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
one and represent leashman and
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative emery
 
01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
sitting on fiscal
 
01:59:58.950 --> 01:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
section one says implement necessary
 
02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
business strategies in the event of a
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
disaster loss of services
 
02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay that sounds great but then
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
when at the end of line 29
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall report to the
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee of the general court
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of any instances
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
where it would need to implement such
 
02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679 align:start position:0%
business strategies including
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
any costs and loss of revenue associated
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
with the disaster or loss of services
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
mike has this been in hb2
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
over and over uh yes
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
i believe it started in 2015.
 
02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought dude does anybody
 
02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:42.550 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought dude does anybody
remember

02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
remember
 
02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
them coming to fiscal committee and this
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
is supposed to
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
allow them to process when they don't
 
02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:51.510 align:start position:0%
allow them to process when they don't
have

02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
can't process credit cards there must
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
have been a time since then
 
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
when there was no electricity and they
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't process credit cards i cannot
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
think of a time when they reported to us
 
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
and i guess section two
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
of this law just using my i.t background
 
02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
section two sounds to me like a time
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
when let's say there's a direct like
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
lightning strike in a shopping mall
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
where there's a liquor station
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
and now you need a long-term contract
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
with somebody technical who will host
 
02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:46.149 align:start position:0%
with somebody technical who will host
your

02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
i.t services at the location and do your
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
credit card processing maybe from a
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
trailer in the parking lot because there
 
02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
are a lot of companies that provide that
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
backup service
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
for those kinds of technical issues i
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
can't think of whatever else that would
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
be but
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
this section seems to me to be
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
relatively benign and probably we should
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
approve it what do the rest of you think
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
represent walls won't hear you if your
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
mic's not on madam chair
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what what rsa 176 says
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
does that limit
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
the size of the contract okay mr hoffman
 
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
the question is what is rsa 176 colon 18
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
and does it
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
limit the size of the contract and that
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
is line
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
34. i'm pulling it up but going from
 
02:02:42.159 --> 02:02:43.750 align:start position:0%
34. i'm pulling it up but going from
memory

02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
memory
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
i believe it addresses competitive
 
02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:51.790 align:start position:0%
i believe it addresses competitive
procurement

02:02:51.790 --> 02:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:55.270 align:start position:0%
 
176.

02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
the title of that section is contracts
 
02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
entered into by the liquor commission
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
it says contracts in excess of ten
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
made or entered into by the commission
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to
 
02:03:17.589 --> 02:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
warehousing transportation advertising
 
02:03:18.149 --> 02:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
competitive competitively billed
 
02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the attorney general and
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
approved by the governor
 
02:03:28.149 --> 02:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
council before becoming effective
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
so represent griffin gives us a very
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
silent thumbs up and
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
i know people at home can't hear his
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
thumbs going up and down but that's what
 
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
represent to burst yeah thank you madam
 
02:03:41.350 --> 02:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
chairman i'm not an i.t
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
specialist but i know that there are
 
02:03:43.679 --> 02:03:44.950 align:start position:0%
specialist but i know that there are
internet

02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
internet
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
providers servers that you know
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
do this for us i mean i don't know is it
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
an overlap here am i missing something
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
i think with it what they're talking
 
02:03:55.830 --> 02:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
about in case of a disaster they would
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
have the ability
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
to go out immediately and do that
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
without coming and asking somebody
 
02:04:01.119 --> 02:04:02.229 align:start position:0%
without coming and asking somebody
permission

02:04:02.229 --> 02:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
permission
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that clarification
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
because we they do have
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of i.t support from doit but say
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
there was a lightning strike close to
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
them it could fritz
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of electrical components and it
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
might not be a case of bringing up a
 
02:04:17.199 --> 02:04:17.990 align:start position:0%
might not be a case of bringing up a
store

02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
store
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
but having the electrical company out to
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
do transformer replacements whatever
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
so represent griffin would you like to
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
move this section to be approved and
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative emery can
 
02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
second it for you so move madam
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%

positions yesterday um lba has found
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
a kind of significant
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
issue with that work is being done on it
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
but that amendment needs to be backed
 
02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:23.669 align:start position:0%
but that amendment needs to be backed
out

02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%

02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
our nightmare
 
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:29.920 align:start position:0%

voting yes on the re rescinding the
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%

representative griffin
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative leishman representative
 
02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%

02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
represent walls yes the vote is seven
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%

02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair could i ask mr hoffman a
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
quick question on
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
revenue sharing i just i would love for
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
you to ask mr hoffman a quick question
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
while i try to figure out what i'm going
 
02:07:58.550 --> 02:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
to do next
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
it looked like a good time to ask um
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
mike could you remind us again that the
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
the maximum amount for revenue sharing
 
02:08:09.270 --> 02:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
is it like 12 million or
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
what the maximum amount that we if we
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask nancy she did some work
 
02:08:18.629 --> 02:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
um looking into the background so no
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
it's not huge dollars but
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
you know significant in a way but 12
 
02:08:28.069 --> 02:08:28.079 align:start position:0%
million a year or something it is 25
 
02:08:28.079 --> 02:08:28.550 align:start position:0%
million a year or something it is 25
million

02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.510 --> 02:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
so manchester is going to get 44 million
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
out of this
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
and that 25 million went everywhere
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
right that's
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
that was my thought when i said what i
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
did because the significance of the
 
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
federal money will far surpass what the
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
state would ever hand out under revenue
 
02:08:56.310 --> 02:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
all right we we have on page starting on
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
page 45
 
02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's sections 100 and 101 and i'd like
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
we haven't talked about those if lba
 
02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:11.599 align:start position:0%
could walk us through those two sections
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
one of them is just an effective date
 
02:09:16.149 --> 02:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
but section 100
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
you'd like me to take a stab at that oh
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
somebody i would like somebody to take a
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
stab at that because i'm not
 
02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
so please yeah this is the statutory
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the biennium which can amount to up
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
to 10 million dollars
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
for a biennium if that provision is not
 
02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:12.709 align:start position:0%
for a biennium if that provision is not
suspended

02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
and so i believe this section um
 
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps that amount um
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:29.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's essentially a free so that if the
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals tax
 
02:10:36.550 --> 02:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
um does not increase there's no
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
additional revenue distributed i believe
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's just a way to cap that
 
02:10:44.709 --> 02:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
accelerator okay so
 
02:10:46.790 --> 02:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
this does a capping of something we've
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
had in hb2
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
yeah you normally um often suspend this
 
02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
or just give five million dollars over
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
the biennium so in
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
one of the two fiscal years rather than
 
02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
5 million each year
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
so this would add a statutory change to
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
that rather than
 
02:11:05.589 --> 02:11:05.599 align:start position:0%
fixing it in house bill 2 as chapter law
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
that would be a blessing because then
 
02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
we'd have less
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
things to do discussion that lba can
 
02:11:14.159 --> 02:11:16.629 align:start position:0%
things to do discussion that lba can
answer

02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
adam chair yes it looks like this
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
it looks like the bolded language is the
 
02:11:24.149 --> 02:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
new language and that's correct to me
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
like this is a recognition
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
of what happened during the pandemic
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
with the rooms and meals taxes dropping
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
so much
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
and trying to make policy consistent
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
with the reality of what's happened over
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
the last year
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
is that a fair assessment i would agree
 
02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
with you but nancy is that a fair
 
02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:40.870 align:start position:0%
with you but nancy is that a fair
assessment

02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
i think so i'd have to look at it more
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
carefully to see um if there's any i
 
02:11:47.109 --> 02:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's an adjustment
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
down i think it's just up normally so
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
um only if the meals and rooms tax
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
increases 75
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
of that income is distributed not to
 
02:11:59.430 --> 02:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
exceed 5 million
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
but i think i'm not sure what effect
 
02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
this actually has if there is
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
if you didn't have that bolded language
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
and there was no increase
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't automatically happen so
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure what the intent of that
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
language actually is
 
02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
because if there is no increase there is
 
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
no percent increase to be added
 
02:12:24.629 --> 02:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's belts and suspenders yeah
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah as you read the regular language it
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow for
 
02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
um a decrease so maybe they're just
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
trying to make clear that
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
that that would not happen but i'm not
 
02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
sure it has any real effect here
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
all right seen that can have a motion to
 
02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:53.990 align:start position:0%

02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay could we look at section 121 which
 
02:13:56.830 --> 02:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:56.840 --> 02:14:08.069 align:start position:0%

02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
all right section 121 it says it's on
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
it says if for for doit if a position
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
they can fill it as long as they don't
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
overspend their budget
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
do i read that correctly lba
 
02:14:36.069 --> 02:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct their budget for
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
um positions yes
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say class 10 and class 10 i
 
02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
does that include moving benefits money
 
02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:01.270 align:start position:0%
does that include moving benefits money
around

02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits for personnel
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
the fifth language has been used for
 
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
other agencies as well
 
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
yes we did look at fiscal committee
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
language and there was a concern that
 
02:15:25.109 --> 02:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
because the department of health and
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
human services has
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
special this sensation that this might
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
somehow be
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
um not possible but
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
we did discuss it in the office and we
 
02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
didn't see any issue with this language
 
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
it would be benefits and whatever and
 
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
the reason they need that is there
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
is a state law that prohibits them from
 
02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
transferring any money
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
out of their benefits line or their
 
02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
personnel line so he couldn't
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
without that he couldn't move the
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
benefits around to help it
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
all right representative emerick moves

02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
all right mike and nancy which which one
 
02:17:00.549 --> 02:17:00.559 align:start position:0%
of these
 
02:17:02.910 --> 02:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
workers comp sections we have 128 and
 
02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:09.190 align:start position:0%
workers comp sections we have 128 and
129

02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
one of those mr mayorfield is still
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
working with a
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
drafting attorney on language is my
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
understanding i've lost track of which
 
02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:17.589 align:start position:0%
understanding i've lost track of which
one

02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory that would be
 
02:17:25.990 --> 02:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
section 128 okay could we perhaps then
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
look at section 129 which is on page 57
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
because i'm going to hold on that until
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
we work it out represent walls
 
02:17:37.190 --> 02:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
pointed something out that i think we
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
need to resolve before we move on
 
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
madam chairman i have been in regular
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
correspondence with
 
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner maryfield and we've
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
agreed on language it's just in the
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
process as soon as it's prepared
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think ols liked the language and
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
there's a little more to it mary beth
 
02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay i just ken maryville gave me
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
language and that sounded good to me i
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
said great i'm not sure what happened
 
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
i'm amazing we've seen we have no
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
amendment i'd say something is going on
 
02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
so we'll move to section 129 and we'll
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
leave that one open
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am chair i think that was one of
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
the later emails to ols
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay can you guys one of you guys walk
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
us through
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
what is going on in 129 i see
 
02:18:40.230 --> 02:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
some language taken out there must be a
 
02:18:44.629 --> 02:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
i believe that's what the commissioner
 
02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
said when he when he was in that they
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
were trying to align things with
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
so apparently the council no longer
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
needs to meet quarterly if you look down
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
at line 31
 
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
it just needs to be as often as
 
02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:10.309 align:start position:0%
it just needs to be as often as
necessary

02:19:10.309 --> 02:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
and we're encouraging standards but
 
02:19:12.399 --> 02:19:13.990 align:start position:0%
and we're encouraging standards but
we're

02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
taking away some other stuff and you
 
02:19:17.910 --> 02:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
turn up to page
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:26.709 --> 02:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:30.150 --> 02:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
which then renumbers all of the sections
 
02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
line 33 we're going from you shall
 
02:19:46.389 --> 02:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
make a report to you may make a report
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
so we know nobody will make a report
 
02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:49.750 align:start position:0%
so we know nobody will make a report
right

02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
do we do we even need to think about
 
02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.469 align:start position:0%
do we do we even need to think about
that

02:19:56.469 --> 02:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
we turn the page now we're on page 59.
 
02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
and again we're striking out some of the
 
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
so i wanted this kind of interesting
 
02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're striking out a statement that
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
apprentice show would not be less than
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
on page 60
 
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm chairman do we know is all of
 
02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
this required by federal law or is some
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
of this just policy that department of
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
labor is trying to implement
 
02:21:01.750 --> 02:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
he testified that it was all to bring
 
02:21:03.750 --> 02:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
him in alignment with current
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
i mean line 32
 
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
is an increase in a funding mechanism
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
and i imagine that is it had changed in
 
02:21:20.230 --> 02:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
federal law and you see
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
another increase in line 35.
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair those two sections are are
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
relative to unemployment compensation
 
02:21:30.870 --> 02:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll be
 
02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
good we're in section 130 all right
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're out out of ours
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
later today yeah we have to deal with
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
that later but they're coming later
 
02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:40.070 align:start position:0%
that later but they're coming later
today

02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.840 --> 02:22:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
27.

02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm chairman i'd like to say some of
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
this looks questionable but i don't want
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
to fight the
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner if he's just trying to
 
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
comply with federal law it still seems
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think you get into some of
 
02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:35.190 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think you get into some of
these

02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
situations where you have to trust that
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
people know what they're doing
 
02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative leashman were you going
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
to say something
 
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
yes madam cheers i've
 
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
been known to say if i feel a little
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with something i usually
 
02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:48.389 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with something i usually
vote

02:22:48.389 --> 02:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
no and i'm not clearly comfortable with
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
all this so
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
if there is a motion to pass i'll likely
 
02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
vote no
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
so what do you guys need to make you
 
02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable because if we don't vote
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
this we need to tell him to get it down
 
02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:00.950 align:start position:0%
this we need to tell him to get it down
here

02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe some sort of correspondence
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair that says specifically this
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
is to
 
02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
put us in line with federal regulations
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman can you tie contact mr
 
02:23:19.270 --> 02:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
merefield and say there are a couple of
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
members who would like
 
02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
clarification whether everything in line
 
02:23:24.319 --> 02:23:25.030 align:start position:0%
clarification whether everything in line
20

02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
20
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
in section 129 is to bring us in
 
02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:28.870 align:start position:0%
in section 129 is to bring us in
alignment

02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
alignment
 
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
with current federal law and if not
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
if he would clarify why the things that
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
are not there
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
are not bringing us in compliance with
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
need to be done and give him a deadline
 
02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
of getting that to you on monday
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely would you prefer a document
 
02:23:49.349 --> 02:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
or would you
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
prefer that i mute myself and try to get
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
him to join the meeting now
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
a document madam chair representation
 
02:23:58.150 --> 02:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
would like a document i think he is
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
thinking lunch
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay i will do thank you madam chairman
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
she knows me all too
 
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative yeah i always have
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
reservations when they
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
change shell to may uh on page
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
58 um as regarding a biannual report
 
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know i'm always one for transparency
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
and this kind of bothers me a little bit
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
that means there'll be no report come on
 
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
let's face it yeah well yes i just
 
02:24:27.270 --> 02:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that was clear thank
 
02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:28.309 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that was clear thank
you

02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
and if there was i'm not sure anybody
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about the department of
 
02:24:39.359 --> 02:24:41.110 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about the department of
corrections

02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
we have been able to
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
fund their vocational training
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
given what we have to cut and what we
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
would have to do
 
02:24:59.110 --> 02:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
i see no way for this division
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
to do anything with their transitional
 
02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:02.870 align:start position:0%
to do anything with their transitional
housing

02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:25:08.230 --> 02:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
the budget i think of the budget as a
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
football game with four quarters the
 
02:25:13.590 --> 02:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
trouble is the quarters aren't the equal
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
15 minutes
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
so the governor's had his phase we're
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
quarter to the house
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
we have to have the budget out of
 
02:25:22.870 --> 02:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
finance i believe that
 
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
chairman weiler will have an exec
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
session on the budget
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
on thursday march 25th
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
because the house deadline is to have
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
everything out by april 1st
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
which wraps around to the beginning of
 
02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
the next week and you have to write the
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
blurb so he needs to have
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
that done so that will be the end of the
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
second quarter
 
02:25:50.230 --> 02:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
we will not have march revenues yet
 
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
we will not have april revenues when we
 
02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:54.150 align:start position:0%
we will not have april revenues when we
know

02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
the business taxes come in and if we are
 
02:25:59.349 --> 02:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
getting out of this pandemic and we see
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
the improvement
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
the business tax revenues will go up
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
so we know this senate will have more
 
02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
money than we have it is a fact of life
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
in fact in some cases
 
02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
we can we count on that when we have to
 
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
make some tough
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
cuts we leave like we did in the
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
treasury leave a dollar behind so it's
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
easy to put the money in
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
although i'm happy to say that the covet
 
02:26:24.309 --> 02:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
bill that was passed in congress
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
has all kinds of money for scholarship
 
02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
for college kids so
 
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
we may not be so bad as we were i can
 
02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
just see
 
02:26:33.750 --> 02:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry no way to do anything with
 
02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
transitional housing
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i've spent a lot of time looking at
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
it looking at that budget
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
so at this point in time
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
their hb1 budget
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
could probably be approved
 
02:26:54.710 --> 02:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
except i
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
have asked lba to get an amendment
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to cut
 
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
the compensation for the parole board
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
from thirty thousand to twenty thousand
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
for thirty six days
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
of meetings in a year but
 
02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
even doing that small cut which is ten
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
times five members
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
you don't get enough money to do
 
02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:23.190 align:start position:0%
you don't get enough money to do
anything

02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
with transitional housing and i
 
02:27:27.990 --> 02:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
think many of us sitting around the
 
02:27:29.910 --> 02:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
table were very concerned with
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
transitional housing
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
i mean mary beth has mentioned a couple
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
times i was
 
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
appalled we asked the commissioner
 
02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm at a point where once we work out
 
02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
the parole board
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
this budget is going to be done for me i
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
just i'm sorry but i can't think of any
 
02:27:47.439 --> 02:27:48.070 align:start position:0%
just i'm sorry but i can't think of any
way

02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
to fix that i'm open to suggestions if a
 
02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:57.910 --> 02:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm doing in some ways i'm
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
hoping for the third quarter i'm hoping
 
02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
the revenues turn around
 
02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it would be nice if we could be the
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
third quarter for a change and have the
 
02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
more money
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
but we don't so now the thing is how can
 
02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
we do the best
 
02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
if the revenues turn around it's easy
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
for the senate to put them back in we
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
adam chair yes i am extremely
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to what your position is and
 
02:28:27.270 --> 02:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
to the efforts that you made in
 
02:28:29.429 --> 02:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
restoring the educational cuts
 
02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
however it's so clear to me from all the
 
02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
terms i've served in the legislature
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
that without the transitional housing
 
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
our recidivism rate is going to climb
 
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
significantly and end up costing us a
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
lot more
 
02:28:44.790 --> 02:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
money in the long run do you have a
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
study on that we could read
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
i would really appreciate seeing a study
 
02:28:49.990 --> 02:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
with some stats on that
 
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
i don't at my fingertips i'm sure
 
02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
they're out there and if you
 
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
want i can try and start reaching out to
 
02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
find something that says that but i i
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know i've said on the the um
 
02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:00.950 align:start position:0%
you know i've said on the the um
intergovernmental

02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
brand i'm forgetting names of the
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
commission all the commissions i've said
 
02:29:04.389 --> 02:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
on here
 
02:29:06.790 --> 02:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
but i've heard this kind of testimony
 
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
over my 13 years in the legislature and
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
you know it's resonating even if i can't
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
point to a study as i said here at the
 
02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:13.670 align:start position:0%
point to a study as i said here at the
moment

02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:29:16.950 --> 02:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
what would you cut to fund that well i
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
can't say that off the top of my head
 
02:29:20.309 --> 02:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not as intimately familiar but i'm
 
02:29:21.750 --> 02:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
sure there's something in here that we
 
02:29:22.389 --> 02:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
can do
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
and i um we can i can start
 
02:29:27.429 --> 02:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
doing a hot and peck if you'd like and
 
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
make a suggestion but i'm telling you
 
02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:30.309 align:start position:0%
make a suggestion but i'm telling you
that

02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
this i know we're not a policy committee
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
but this is
 
02:29:35.190 --> 02:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
a policy that's going to come back to
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
bite us it's much like we cut the mental
 
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
health budget and it came back and cost
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
us a fortune if we cut this it's going
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
to come back and cost us a lot in
 
02:29:42.479 --> 02:29:43.030 align:start position:0%
to come back and cost us a lot in
additional

02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
corrections costs and i i i'm not trying
 
02:29:48.309 --> 02:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
to make this
 
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
anything about you madam chair i
 
02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
understand the position you're in i
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
understand what you've gone through
 
02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
but honestly i would beg that we find
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
something to restore
 
02:30:01.030 --> 02:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
transitional housing because it is such
 
02:30:03.830 --> 02:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
a cost saving measure in the long run
 
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay let's
 
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
let's be clear we did not a hundred
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
percent unfunded transitional housing
 
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
i know you're talking about restoring
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
transitional housing
 
02:30:16.790 --> 02:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
in manchester the city of manchester and
 
02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:17.110 align:start position:0%
in manchester the city of manchester and
i

02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
think much of the money that was taken
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
out of manchester
 
02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
was actually at the request of mayor
 
02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:26.550 align:start position:0%
was actually at the request of mayor
craig

02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
craig
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
who has been very vocal about not
 
02:30:31.590 --> 02:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
wanting it
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
so we do have some transitional housing
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
i hear what you're saying
 
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
i do not have a cut i do not have an
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
idea and
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think another division is going
 
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
to cut money to give to us although i
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
have to tell you i did reach out to
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
karen and jess i mean what the heck
 
02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
why not try to poach money so i hear
 
02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
i want you guys to know where i am i
 
02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:53.590 align:start position:0%
i want you guys to know where i am i
mean

02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
i've always tried to be really honest
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
with you and don't wait till last minute
 
02:30:57.750 --> 02:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
have you think well it's coming it's
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
coming no i can't find any way to do
 
02:30:59.520 --> 02:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
coming no i can't find any way to do
that

02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to vote it today
 
02:31:03.750 --> 02:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
because of the parole board situation
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
this was really just kind of
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
um telling you
 
02:31:12.070 --> 02:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
where we were so i appreciate the
 
02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:13.750 align:start position:0%
where we were so i appreciate the
comments

02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
comments
 
02:31:15.429 --> 02:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the heads up that's
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
very helpful to know what's coming and i
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate not having it as a surprise
 
02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
um i just it's important to me as a
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
matter of policy that i think that it is
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
one of those things that saves the state
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money recidivism
 
02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
is very expensive
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
and and i would just like to do some i i
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
would hope that as best as possible
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
this budget would reflect things that
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
look at the big picture
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
and do not cost us additional money in
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
the future but i
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
again i'm very sympathetic to where
 
02:31:47.110 --> 02:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
madam chairman is i
 
02:31:49.990 --> 02:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
understand exactly where what you're
 
02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.349 align:start position:0%
understand exactly where what you're
saying

02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative leishman you have a
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
question yeah man i'm sure i
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
i do recall reading or hearing and maybe
 
02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
we could find out specifically but i do
 
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
recall that the elected officials the
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
mayor of manchester have said they
 
02:32:08.070 --> 02:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
didn't want such housing in their city
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
because there was talk about using even
 
02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
the sununu center
 
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
and there was great outcry against using
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
the sununu center so
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
that that's out there mary beth so we
 
02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
need to track that down
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
but the other transitional housing unit
 
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
being cut is right here in concord and
 
02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's no objection from the city of
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
concord i think they'd be happy if was
 
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
it shay farm
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
continues this transitional housing
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
there yeah if i had money
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative walls i i hear you i
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
the reason we're having this discussion
 
02:32:39.670 --> 02:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
is i cannot come up with a
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
creative suggestion so what another um
 
02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
another budget we haven't approved
 
02:32:52.710 --> 02:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
is the judicial council
 
02:32:54.630 --> 02:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative leishman moves to approve
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
the judicial council
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative griffin seconds if you're
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
in favor of approving the judicial

02:36:46.309 --> 02:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
could everybody turn to page 185
 
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay i think people have quit shuffling
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
through their books so i think we've
 
02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
gotten there
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
um page 185 is the executive council
 
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
which is 100 percent general funded
 
02:37:26.230 --> 02:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
their adjusted authorized for 2021
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
was 261 331
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
this is basically the benefits workers
 
02:37:34.399 --> 02:37:35.429 align:start position:0%
this is basically the benefits workers
comp

02:37:35.429 --> 02:37:35.439 align:start position:0%

02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
in-state travel at the bottom of the
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
previous page on 184 when you open up
 
02:37:42.469 --> 02:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
your book pages
 
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%

02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:49.280 align:start position:0%

members get
 
02:37:53.910 --> 02:37:53.920 align:start position:0%

02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
funded but for 2022 they are slightly
 
02:37:57.600 --> 02:37:58.550 align:start position:0%

at 256 336 dollars
 
02:38:06.630 --> 02:38:06.640 align:start position:0%

02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
the department of energy which is a
 
02:39:38.760 --> 02:39:40.550 align:start position:0%
the department of energy which is a
reorganization

02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
reorganization
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
and as i understand what is done we have
 
02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:45.270 align:start position:0%
and as i understand what is done we have
taken

02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
taken
 
02:39:49.030 --> 02:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
office of strategic information osi
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission puc
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
we have combined them into a committee
 
02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:56.309 align:start position:0%
we have combined them into a committee
but

02:39:56.309 --> 02:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
we cut out and sent the planners to bea
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
which taylor caswell talked to us about
 
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
and we sent
 
02:40:07.830 --> 02:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
two positions to das
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
so we kind of have a little mixture here
 
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
and you guys are going to walk us
 
02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:12.950 align:start position:0%
and you guys are going to walk us
through

02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
how do you want to start do you want to
 
02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
go through hb2 first you want to
 
02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
i mean hb yeah h32 those sections do you
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
go through your handouts first that that
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
i haven't looked at these i just got
 
02:40:28.230 --> 02:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
them so for sure let me open them up
 
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
i think we would prefer to start with
 
02:40:31.590 --> 02:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
the presentation which was sent
 
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
out earlier this morning okay from there
 
02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
go line by line through hb1 and then
 
02:40:39.269 --> 02:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
save hb2 for the end
 
02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
okay we're amenable to that okay
 
02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
excellent so you should see three
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
different items in your handout
 
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
one of them is a letter from chairwoman
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
diane martin
 
02:40:52.950 --> 02:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
of the public utilities commission which
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
is an explanation to the methodology
 
02:40:55.510 --> 02:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
they used
 
02:40:58.150 --> 02:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
for one of the line items we'll cover
 
02:40:59.190 --> 02:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
that in more
 
02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
depth later but just so you know what it
 
02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:03.110 align:start position:0%
depth later but just so you know what it
is

02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh the second three sheets are responses
 
02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:07.190 align:start position:0%
uh the second three sheets are responses
to

02:41:07.190 --> 02:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions that have been uh asked of
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
other presenters
 
02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
yes they are just kind of the standard
 
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
that go out to every agency for division
 
02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:15.110 align:start position:0%
that go out to every agency for division
one

02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
um we aired on the side of caution and
 
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
answered those for you as well
 
02:41:20.950 --> 02:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you did because we may need
 
02:41:22.710 --> 02:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
them okay thank you so we can definitely
 
02:41:24.309 --> 02:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
talk to those as well
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh and the last chunk is the powerpoint
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
presentation which is about 23 slides
 
02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay um and i think from there we'll
 
02:41:33.670 --> 02:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
jump right into it
 
02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
i will start chair one by saying it's
 
02:41:37.830 --> 02:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
great to hear that there's already some
 
02:41:40.389 --> 02:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
basic level of understanding on what the
 
02:41:40.950 --> 02:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
end goal
 
02:41:43.750 --> 02:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
here uh really is and and why the
 
02:41:45.190 --> 02:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
governor sees this as
 
02:41:47.990 --> 02:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
a good path forward not just from an
 
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
organization and structure of government
 
02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
organization and structure of government
standpoint

02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
02:41:53.349 --> 02:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
but also the policy objectives uh that
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
we hope to reach
 
02:41:58.710 --> 02:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh so with that going to slide two
 
02:42:00.150 --> 02:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
much in the same way that chairwoman
 
02:42:01.990 --> 02:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
over just discussed
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
the office of strategic initiatives is
 
02:42:04.399 --> 02:42:05.269 align:start position:0%
the office of strategic initiatives is
dissolved

02:42:05.269 --> 02:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
dissolved
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
by this proposal with its functions
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
split between
 
02:42:12.230 --> 02:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
bea das and
 
02:42:14.309 --> 02:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
the remainder reorganized into this
 
02:42:16.630 --> 02:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
02:42:19.590 --> 02:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission is
 
02:42:21.429 --> 02:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
entirely reorganized
 
02:42:24.550 --> 02:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
within the department of energy with the
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
existing adjudicative functions think of
 
02:42:29.349 --> 02:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
the three commissioners that preside
 
02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
over dawkins
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
they become a much smaller
 
02:42:36.309 --> 02:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
administratively attached unit
 
02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
that we'll go into more detail later
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
proposal is introduced does not make any
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
changes to the office of the consumer
 
02:42:44.399 --> 02:42:45.429 align:start position:0%
changes to the office of the consumer
advocate

02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
or the site evaluation committee and
 
02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
chairwoman i know you've had questions
 
02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:49.990 align:start position:0%
chairwoman i know you've had questions
about

02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:42:52.230 --> 02:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
potential work that could be done to the
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
sec through this process
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to continue those
 
02:42:58.630 --> 02:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
conversations today as well
 
02:43:01.030 --> 02:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
but as introduced no no changes to be
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
made there
 
02:43:06.630 --> 02:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
on slide three this is a brief overview
 
02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
of osi
 
02:43:10.469 --> 02:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
which exists within the executive
 
02:43:12.550 --> 02:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
department it's one of the governor's
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
offices if you will
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
organized into the division of energy
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
and the division of planning
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
and osi has expansive duties currently
 
02:43:25.110 --> 02:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
they do everything from the u.s census
 
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
to the national flood insurance program
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
at one point they did the governor's
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
in addition to being a pass-through for
 
02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
federal energy grants
 
02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
like fuel assistance and weatherization
 
02:43:39.990 --> 02:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
this structure represents you have a
 
02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
question yes yes i do management you
 
02:43:43.269 --> 02:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
census is done but i thought it was from
 
02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
the department of commerce
 
02:43:50.070 --> 02:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
with the u.s government yes so the if
 
02:43:51.030 --> 02:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
the census is done
 
02:43:53.190 --> 02:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
federally but each state has a point of
 
02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:54.469 align:start position:0%
federally but each state has a point of
contact

02:43:54.469 --> 02:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
contact
 
02:44:00.870 --> 02:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:03.269 --> 02:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
so again this is a very broad list it's
 
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
probably broader than just about any
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
agency in state government
 
02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
and by allocating these different
 
02:44:11.190 --> 02:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
functions to more appropriate
 
02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
existing units of government we see both
 
02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.110 align:start position:0%
existing units of government we see both
efficiencies

02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
efficiencies
 
02:44:17.990 --> 02:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
potential for cost savings and overall
 
02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
again a better
 
02:44:21.269 --> 02:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
policy structure for the state to meet
 
02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:25.750 --> 02:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
and what are those policy objectives
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
this is on slide four
 
02:44:30.469 --> 02:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is unique to the
 
02:44:31.750 --> 02:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire public utilities
 
02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
commission and if you talk to lawyers or
 
02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
if you talk to people that regularly
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
appear there
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
the the pucs current structure enables
 
02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
staff to occupy this dual role
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
where if i was a stakeholder
 
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
and chris was a puc staffer
 
02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
we would both present arguments during a
 
02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:53.190 align:start position:0%
we would both present arguments during a
docket

02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
docket
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
but then the puc staffer has the ability
 
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
to then
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
advise those commissioners as they make
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
their decision
 
02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
it creates the potential for perceived
 
02:45:06.389 --> 02:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest
 
02:45:08.389 --> 02:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
and what this proposal would do
 
02:45:08.399 --> 02:45:09.429 align:start position:0%
and what this proposal would do
fundamentally

02:45:09.429 --> 02:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
fundamentally
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
is establish a bright red line you're
 
02:45:13.750 --> 02:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
either an advisor
 
02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
helping the commission come to a
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
decision or you're someone
 
02:45:20.469 --> 02:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
that is working on the docket compiling
 
02:45:20.479 --> 02:45:21.510 align:start position:0%
that is working on the docket compiling
evidence

02:45:21.510 --> 02:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
02:45:24.389 --> 02:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
building the evidentiary record but not
 
02:45:24.399 --> 02:45:25.190 align:start position:0%
building the evidentiary record but not
both

02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
this is a structure we see in other
 
02:45:28.710 --> 02:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
states like vermont we see it at the
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
and essentially removes again any
 
02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
perceived conflicts that might arise
 
02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
from the current structure and just
 
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
another benefit tying into that
 
02:45:40.790 --> 02:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
chris you have to pull that microphone
 
02:45:42.550 --> 02:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
up remember we have two reps at home and
 
02:45:43.269 --> 02:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:45:45.110 --> 02:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
sound problems under the best because
 
02:45:47.349 --> 02:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
these air cleansing machines
 
02:45:49.750 --> 02:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
that cleans the air every five times
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
every hour are wonderful but
 
02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
tiny bit noisy gotcha well um
 
02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
just to tie into what matt was saying
 
02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
there related to that bright red line
 
02:46:01.349 --> 02:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
um some of you if you've dealt with the
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
puc on
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
energy issues you might have found that
 
02:46:06.070 --> 02:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
there are times when either a
 
02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:06.710 align:start position:0%
there are times when either a
commissioner

02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:46:08.790 --> 02:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
or a staff member has to recuse
 
02:46:09.990 --> 02:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
themselves from a conversation
 
02:46:12.309 --> 02:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
where they say i can't speak to the
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
issue that you're talking about because
 
02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:13.830 align:start position:0%
issue that you're talking about because
i'm

02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:46:15.030 --> 02:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be ruling on it or i'm
 
02:46:17.190 --> 02:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
going to be supporting that in some way
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
by creating this bright red line and
 
02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
having this separate department it adds
 
02:46:23.110 --> 02:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
a level of accessibility for legislators
 
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
and for others
 
02:46:25.590 --> 02:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh stakeholders to be able to approach
 
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
and say if i want to talk about this
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
and and make my position known you know
 
02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:30.950 align:start position:0%
and and make my position known you know
and

02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
and how that relates to the state's
 
02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
interest i can approach
 
02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh the department and and without fear
 
02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:37.349 align:start position:0%
uh the department and and without fear
of

02:46:37.349 --> 02:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know either being pushed aside or
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
not being able to talk to the
 
02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:41.030 align:start position:0%
not being able to talk to the
appropriate

02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh individual so it it brings in i
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know at least in the conversations
 
02:46:47.510 --> 02:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
we've had a great deal of legislative
 
02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:48.630 align:start position:0%
we've had a great deal of legislative
accessibility

02:46:48.630 --> 02:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
accessibility
 
02:46:51.830 --> 02:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
that can sometimes be um probably more
 
02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:52.630 align:start position:0%
that can sometimes be um probably more
difficult

02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
unless you want to you know get on the
 
02:46:56.309 --> 02:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
lists uh for the puc and deal with
 
02:46:58.469 --> 02:46:58.479 align:start position:0%
hundreds of emails and and try to figure
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
out when and where to jump in
 
02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
so that was just related to what uh matt
 
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
was saying there
 
02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
and and just to add on to that if you
 
02:47:07.750 --> 02:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
have a constituent that has a question
 
02:47:09.429 --> 02:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
about environmental permitting
 
02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
right you call the commissioner of des
 
02:47:12.950 --> 02:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
they can get you an answer
 
02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
if that's a utility issue today you
 
02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
can't call one of the commissioners
 
02:47:17.670 --> 02:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
right they
 
02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
are bound by ex party rules and by
 
02:47:22.070 --> 02:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
creating this department with a singular
 
02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:22.710 align:start position:0%
creating this department with a singular
mission

02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
mission
 
02:47:25.429 --> 02:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
focused on energy policy we believe it
 
02:47:26.309 --> 02:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
adds not only
 
02:47:29.349 --> 02:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
accessibility but also accountability
 
02:47:31.590 --> 02:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
and that comes here in bullet point two
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
where under this new proposal
 
02:47:36.309 --> 02:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
all leadership positions would require
 
02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
governor and council approval
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
madam chairman representative leachman
 
02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:42.150 align:start position:0%
madam chairman representative leachman
please

02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
so matt i'd like to back you up a little
 
02:47:47.030 --> 02:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
bit where you talk about establishing a
 
02:47:50.469 --> 02:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
bright red line you know the federal
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
judges they
 
02:47:54.790 --> 02:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
rely on their clerks to write decisions
 
02:47:57.510 --> 02:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
um federally the federal service
 
02:47:59.510 --> 02:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
transportation board they've got five
 
02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
members they rely heavily on their staff
 
02:48:02.230 --> 02:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused what you said that
 
02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
this separation between the so-called
 
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
judges if you will and not interfering
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
with staff and advising because
 
02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
staff advises all these people as far as
 
02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:15.349 align:start position:0%
staff advises all these people as far as
decisions

02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's a very good point
 
02:48:17.910 --> 02:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:19.190 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

02:48:19.190 --> 02:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
there are staff and we'll touch on this
 
02:48:22.710 --> 02:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
later in the presentation
 
02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
specifically in an advisory capacity
 
02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
to these commissioners to help them come
 
02:48:29.190 --> 02:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
to their rulings
 
02:48:31.990 --> 02:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
but those individuals are fully separate
 
02:48:33.429 --> 02:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
from the individuals that would
 
02:48:36.230 --> 02:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
present a case before them so certainly
 
02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:37.190 align:start position:0%
present a case before them so certainly
agree

02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
agree
 
02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
that they need that advisory um
 
02:48:42.550 --> 02:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
that advisory staff to help them come to
 
02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
the decisions and
 
02:48:46.630 --> 02:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
i believe it's on slide 23 you'll see
 
02:48:48.710 --> 02:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
what that looks like
 
02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah but sure
 
02:48:55.269 --> 02:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
happy to do so because i want to clarify
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
any confusion that that might exist
 
02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
you're welcome so under the current
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
structure only the puc commissioners
 
02:49:06.070 --> 02:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
require governor and council approval
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
none of the division directors do
 
02:49:09.990 --> 02:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
no one at osi requires governor and
 
02:49:11.349 --> 02:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
council approval
 
02:49:13.990 --> 02:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
under this new structure all leadership
 
02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:15.190 align:start position:0%
under this new structure all leadership
positions

02:49:15.190 --> 02:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
the division directors the commissioner
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
of energy the deputy commissioner of
 
02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:20.070 align:start position:0%
of energy the deputy commissioner of
energy

02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:49:21.510 --> 02:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
would go through that formal
 
02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
confirmation process for a defined
 
02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
term um again we think that is a step
 
02:49:30.070 --> 02:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
forward from the current structure
 
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
and lastly on this slide this proposal
 
02:49:33.990 --> 02:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
unifies all of those energy policy
 
02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:34.710 align:start position:0%
unifies all of those energy policy
efforts

02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
within a single department rather than
 
02:49:38.950 --> 02:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
being scattered in a couple different
 
02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:41.349 align:start position:0%
being scattered in a couple different
places

02:49:41.349 --> 02:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
places
 
02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
on slide five we'll discuss the general
 
02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:45.030 align:start position:0%
on slide five we'll discuss the general
fund

02:49:45.030 --> 02:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:49:47.269 --> 02:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
impact and what's important to note is
 
02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
that these agencies
 
02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
are a very small portion of their
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
funding comes from general funds
 
02:49:56.389 --> 02:49:56.399 align:start position:0%
but what does come from general funds
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
02:50:01.429 --> 02:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
creates roughly five hundred thousand
 
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in savings
 
02:50:05.349 --> 02:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
over the biennium the vast majority of
 
02:50:06.790 --> 02:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
the funds for this department
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
are federal funds dedicated funds or the
 
02:50:11.990 --> 02:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
utility assessment
 
02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
but it's i want to stress that through
 
02:50:16.630 --> 02:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
this we are finding ways to reduce the
 
02:50:20.469 --> 02:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
and we do that through creating
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
efficiencies you're essentially
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
eliminating a whole um executive branch
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
agency by by taking this step
 
02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
which creates it chairman i have a
 
02:50:33.349 --> 02:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
couple of questions i don't know if it's
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate to interrupt
 
02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to let you interrupt a minute
 
02:50:38.469 --> 02:50:38.479 align:start position:0%
let me ask one question before you go in
 
02:50:41.830 --> 02:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
matt when i look at this
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
and then and you may get to it
 
02:50:46.710 --> 02:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
under the governor of phase recommended
 
02:50:49.269 --> 02:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
i do not see the two people going to das
 
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
on that line so you're going to have to
 
02:50:52.790 --> 02:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
figure out how to talk about that
 
02:50:54.550 --> 02:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to let representative
 
02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
walls ask her questions
 
02:50:58.309 --> 02:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
represent walls please thank you very
 
02:50:59.590 --> 02:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
much madam chairman
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
so you speak about the general funds
 
02:51:03.670 --> 02:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
costs but
 
02:51:05.190 --> 02:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
i believe that there will be an increase
 
02:51:07.269 --> 02:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
cost at the puc side
 
02:51:09.110 --> 02:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
and ordinarily that would be passed
 
02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
through to the utilities that are
 
02:51:10.800 --> 02:51:11.830 align:start position:0%
through to the utilities that are
regulated

02:51:11.830 --> 02:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
is there going to have to be an increase
 
02:51:15.910 --> 02:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the cost in the pass-through to the
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
regulated utilities because
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
i noticed that this um creation of this
 
02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
actually creates a bunch of new
 
02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:23.030 align:start position:0%
actually creates a bunch of new
positions

02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:51:24.309 --> 02:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
if they're not being paid for out of
 
02:51:26.070 --> 02:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
general funds or if they've got
 
02:51:27.510 --> 02:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
money out of the general funds how are
 
02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
we coming up with the money for these
 
02:51:30.550 --> 02:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
seven or eight new positions that are
 
02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
buried in here
 
02:51:33.990 --> 02:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
sure and we'll cover that on slide seven
 
02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:51:36.469 --> 02:51:36.479 align:start position:0%
um but to respond to representative
 
02:51:37.830 --> 02:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
ober's question
 
02:51:40.950 --> 02:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
the two positions that go to das are a
 
02:51:42.309 --> 02:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
hundred percent funded by
 
02:51:44.309 --> 02:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
an endowment that's the conservation
 
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
land stewardship program
 
02:51:48.309 --> 02:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
so there are no general funds tied to
 
02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
either of those two positions
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mary beth hold that
 
02:51:52.790 --> 02:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
question until we get until seven
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
i will recognize you then to make sure
 
02:51:58.070 --> 02:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
you're getting your answer thank you
 
02:51:59.990 --> 02:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
on slide six and this is where i would
 
02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
like to refer to the letter from
 
02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
chairwoman diane martin
 
02:52:07.190 --> 02:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
at the puc which explains
 
02:52:11.429 --> 02:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
there's an increase to class line 73
 
02:52:14.230 --> 02:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
in 22 and 23 compared to the current
 
02:52:14.240 --> 02:52:15.670 align:start position:0%
in 22 and 23 compared to the current
biennium

02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
those dollars are allocated to the state
 
02:52:21.429 --> 02:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
through the regional greenhouse gas
 
02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
initiative quarterly auction
 
02:52:26.630 --> 02:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
the puc projects that those auctions
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
will yield more revenue
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
the revenue the state receives is a
 
02:52:34.070 --> 02:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
direct pass-through back to rate payers
 
02:52:37.030 --> 02:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
in the form of rebates so while in the
 
02:52:37.830 --> 02:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
budget book
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
if you look at the total for the
 
02:52:41.190 --> 02:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
department of energy it looks like it's
 
02:52:41.200 --> 02:52:42.230 align:start position:0%
department of energy it looks like it's
increasing

02:52:42.230 --> 02:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
02:52:45.269 --> 02:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
several million dollars each year we can
 
02:52:45.279 --> 02:52:45.670 align:start position:0%
several million dollars each year we can
tie

02:52:45.670 --> 02:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
tie
 
02:52:47.590 --> 02:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
almost a hundred percent of that
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
directly to this
 
02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
one class line that is a direct pass
 
02:52:54.230 --> 02:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
through back to ratepayers
 
02:52:56.230 --> 02:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
what's the class line on that so that's
 
02:52:57.910 --> 02:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
class 73
 
02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
in accounting unit 1887
 
02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
which is on page 359 and when we get
 
02:53:04.710 --> 02:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
into the
 
02:53:07.349 --> 02:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
actual line by line of hb1 more than
 
02:53:09.269 --> 02:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
happy to re-identify then
 
02:53:12.710 --> 02:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
any questions on that for right now nope
 
02:53:18.870 --> 02:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
to slide seven so and to your question
 
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
02:53:23.830 --> 02:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh i do want to walk through where these
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
position numbers come from
 
02:53:28.950 --> 02:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the total for the
 
02:53:31.190 --> 02:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
02:53:34.230 --> 02:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
in the budget book you'll see in 21 and
 
02:53:34.240 --> 02:53:35.110 align:start position:0%
in the budget book you'll see in 21 and
22

02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
22
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
82 established positions
 
02:53:41.190 --> 02:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
if you look in years 22 and 23 you see
 
02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:42.630 align:start position:0%
if you look in years 22 and 23 you see
105

02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
105
 
02:53:46.630 --> 02:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
and 104. part of that increase
 
02:53:49.349 --> 02:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
is a misnomer because of the way the
 
02:53:49.359 --> 02:53:49.750 align:start position:0%
is a misnomer because of the way the
state

02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
accounts for positions 12
 
02:53:56.230 --> 02:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
positions of that increase are currently
 
02:53:56.240 --> 02:53:57.349 align:start position:0%
positions of that increase are currently
existing

02:53:57.349 --> 02:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:54:01.349 --> 02:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
at osi but most of osi's positions exist
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
in a non-classified status
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
essentially they serve at the pleasure
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
of the governor but are they in class 11
 
02:54:09.429 --> 02:54:09.439 align:start position:0%
when they're budgeted
 
02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
yes so their salaries are accounted for
 
02:54:15.590 --> 02:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
but through this transition they're now
 
02:54:17.670 --> 02:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
either becoming classified
 
02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
or unclassified employees
 
02:54:23.670 --> 02:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
at which point their position gets added
 
02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
to the budget system
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
and we don't show the people in class 11
 
02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
in the position total at the bottom of
 
02:54:31.830 --> 02:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
the page isn't that correct
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's correct mary beth does that
 
02:54:38.550 --> 02:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
i think you're muted no okay no i'm
 
02:54:43.510 --> 02:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
sorry just a little slow to unmute
 
02:54:47.110 --> 02:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
um so i'm i'm not following
 
02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
i was just going back to the budget book
 
02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
but my question still remains
 
02:54:53.910 --> 02:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
will there be an increased assessment
 
02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
against the utilities to pay for any of
 
02:54:57.750 --> 02:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
these new positions
 
02:55:00.710 --> 02:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
i think that's what matt is saying the
 
02:55:01.990 --> 02:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
budget book
 
02:55:04.950 --> 02:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't count all the positions we get
 
02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:05.269 align:start position:0%
doesn't count all the positions we get
no

02:55:05.269 --> 02:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:55:07.750 --> 02:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
count on people in class 50 which is
 
02:55:08.790 --> 02:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
part time
 
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
we really get no count on people who are
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
non-classified in class 11. so these
 
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
people have
 
02:55:18.469 --> 02:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
been there and have been paid but the
 
02:55:20.230 --> 02:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
budget book the way this
 
02:55:22.950 --> 02:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
system works they never count so now
 
02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
they're being put into class lines where
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
they will be counted
 
02:55:29.349 --> 02:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
so it's the same number of people
 
02:55:31.429 --> 02:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
but now you're seeing the total count
 
02:55:31.439 --> 02:55:32.550 align:start position:0%
but now you're seeing the total count
accurately

02:55:32.550 --> 02:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
accurately
 
02:55:34.790 --> 02:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
so i i didn't understand that madam
 
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
chair but i'm talking about the revenue
 
02:55:38.710 --> 02:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
to pay for this because he said there's
 
02:55:40.070 --> 02:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
small cost against the general fund but
 
02:55:44.469 --> 02:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
this is a large department
 
02:55:45.910 --> 02:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
or small increase in the general fund
 
02:55:47.590 --> 02:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
this is a large department
 
02:55:49.590 --> 02:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
and for example the puc right now is a
 
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
100 percent pass-through of an
 
02:55:53.349 --> 02:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
assessment against the utilities
 
02:55:55.990 --> 02:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
and to do this transition and to have
 
02:55:57.910 --> 02:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
the new positions in the puc and the
 
02:55:59.429 --> 02:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
positions of the department of energy
 
02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
and maintain everything
 
02:56:02.070 --> 02:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
and as i read this there's something
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
like eight new positions in the
 
02:56:05.030 --> 02:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy that don't exist
 
02:56:06.150 --> 02:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
but at any rate to have all this my
 
02:56:09.590 --> 02:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
question still is
 
02:56:11.429 --> 02:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
is will the assessment against the
 
02:56:13.750 --> 02:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
utilities have to increase
 
02:56:15.349 --> 02:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question
 
02:56:17.190 --> 02:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative walls and i'd point you
 
02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
to the chart where it says the net new
 
02:56:20.230 --> 02:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
positions of 11
 
02:56:22.950 --> 02:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
right those would be the new positions
 
02:56:24.830 --> 02:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
that we're creating as part of this
 
02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:26.389 align:start position:0%
that we're creating as part of this
reorganization

02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
reorganization
 
02:56:29.830 --> 02:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
those positions would be funded
 
02:56:32.950 --> 02:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
through the utility assessment
 
02:56:36.070 --> 02:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
or federal funds or other funds and on
 
02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
the questions that i submitted or
 
02:56:39.030 --> 02:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
answers to questions i submitted that
 
02:56:41.429 --> 02:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
we'll get to in a moment
 
02:56:44.469 --> 02:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
i detail those funding sources in
 
02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
the interim there would be a
 
02:56:49.990 --> 02:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
moderate increase in the utility
 
02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:51.190 align:start position:0%
moderate increase in the utility
assessment

02:56:51.190 --> 02:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
to account for this transition but the
 
02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:54.790 align:start position:0%
to account for this transition but the
reason

02:56:54.790 --> 02:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:56:58.070 --> 02:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
why that has to happen is because we're
 
02:57:00.309 --> 02:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
creating new positions that require
 
02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
governor and council confirmation we
 
02:57:03.990 --> 02:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
can't place
 
02:57:07.750 --> 02:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
a classified individual in that role
 
02:57:09.990 --> 02:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
so if anything there are more positions
 
02:57:12.230 --> 02:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
that exist in the budget system
 
02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
than we would ever actually want to fill
 
02:57:16.230 --> 02:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
at this department
 
02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
define moder mod modest increase is that
 
02:57:22.790 --> 02:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
roughly 10 050 thousand a million what's
 
02:57:24.630 --> 02:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
what's modest to you so that's roughly
 
02:57:26.710 --> 02:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
1.5 million
 
02:57:29.590 --> 02:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
during this transitional period of the
 
02:57:31.349 --> 02:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
utility assessment
 
02:57:34.550 --> 02:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
but again once people are confirmed into
 
02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:35.670 align:start position:0%
but again once people are confirmed into
those

02:57:35.670 --> 02:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:57:38.790 --> 02:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
governor and council positions or let me
 
02:57:39.510 --> 02:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
put it this way
 
02:57:41.750 --> 02:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're essentially double budgeting for
 
02:57:43.269 --> 02:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
some positions
 
02:57:45.030 --> 02:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to lay anyone off
 
02:57:46.950 --> 02:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
as part of this reorganization
 
02:57:49.030 --> 02:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
so we need to keep them in their current
 
02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:50.230 align:start position:0%
so we need to keep them in their current
role

02:57:50.230 --> 02:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
role
 
02:57:51.750 --> 02:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
we know that some people in the
 
02:57:53.910 --> 02:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
department will raise their hand
 
02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
to be a division director or to be a
 
02:57:57.750 --> 02:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
deputy director for the
 
02:58:00.790 --> 02:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
department but we we can't
 
02:58:03.429 --> 02:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
not budget for their current role and we
 
02:58:03.990 --> 02:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
know that they
 
02:58:07.349 --> 02:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
would never occupy both so
 
02:58:10.630 --> 02:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
it is an accounting function the
 
02:58:13.670 --> 02:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
the glide path that we are on is once
 
02:58:16.150 --> 02:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
you are through this transition
 
02:58:18.389 --> 02:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
our intention is not to increase the
 
02:58:20.550 --> 02:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
draw on the utility fund
 
02:58:23.590 --> 02:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
it is not to increase head count we see
 
02:58:26.710 --> 02:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
this as a way to get to efficiencies
 
02:58:29.910 --> 02:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
but rather than trying to ram something
 
02:58:29.920 --> 02:58:30.389 align:start position:0%
but rather than trying to ram something
through

02:58:30.389 --> 02:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:58:32.230 --> 02:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
or potentially jeopardize people's
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
positions based on a timeline
 
02:58:37.349 --> 02:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
we didn't eliminate those positions
 
02:58:39.349 --> 02:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
prior to them becoming vacant
 
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay i guess i'm going to be devil's
 
02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
advocate here and you're going to hate
 
02:58:42.160 --> 02:58:44.630 align:start position:0%
advocate here and you're going to hate
that

02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:48.790 --> 02:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
you had no problem unfunding vocational
 
02:58:50.389 --> 02:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
training in department of corrections
 
02:58:51.190 --> 02:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
even though those
 
02:58:53.429 --> 02:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
positions were filled and now they had
 
02:58:54.710 --> 02:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
no money
 
02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
you had no problem unfunding and laying
 
02:58:59.670 --> 02:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
off people in doit
 
02:59:01.990 --> 02:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
who were doing help desk work so those
 
02:59:03.670 --> 02:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
weren't empty positions but those were
 
02:59:05.190 --> 02:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
positions laying in them
 
02:59:07.030 --> 02:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
and now you tell me you have a problem
 
02:59:08.230 --> 02:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
doing it here i don't
 
02:59:10.870 --> 02:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
understand how that tracks and do you
 
02:59:12.389 --> 02:59:12.399 align:start position:0%
see where i'm coming from
 
02:59:13.750 --> 02:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
i do see where you're coming from
 
02:59:16.150 --> 02:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative it's a very fair point
 
02:59:18.870 --> 02:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
what i would say is that our intention
 
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
was not
 
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
to be in a position to lay anyone off
 
02:59:24.950 --> 02:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately because of general fund
 
02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:26.150 align:start position:0%
ultimately because of general fund
constraints

02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
constraints
 
02:59:29.349 --> 02:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
we didn't have that flexibility at those
 
02:59:31.510 --> 02:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
other departments that you mentioned
 
02:59:34.150 --> 02:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
here with the utility assessment given
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:59:37.269 --> 02:59:37.279 align:start position:0%
is an assessed cost specific to the
 
02:59:39.510 --> 02:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
regulation of the entity
 
02:59:42.550 --> 02:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
we felt more comfortable using a
 
02:59:45.830 --> 02:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
slower transition and
 
02:59:48.389 --> 02:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
again double accounting for some
 
02:59:49.750 --> 02:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
positions that will remain
 
02:59:52.950 --> 02:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
vacant and will not be paid out
 
02:59:56.070 --> 02:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
rather than forcing um
 
02:59:58.710 --> 02:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
people out of jobs or to find
 
02:59:58.720 --> 03:00:00.070 align:start position:0%
people out of jobs or to find
alternatives

03:00:00.070 --> 03:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
alternatives
 
03:00:03.269 --> 03:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
when there wasn't a compelling reason to
 
03:00:05.349 --> 03:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
force that issue on day one
 
03:00:07.830 --> 03:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
representation when your hand was up no
 
03:00:09.830 --> 03:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
thanks ma'am
 
03:00:11.910 --> 03:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
so man i'm gonna quote you you just said
 
03:00:13.190 --> 03:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
you didn't want to ram
 
03:00:16.389 --> 03:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
anything through this is i've been on
 
03:00:19.030 --> 03:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
finance this is my sixth term
 
03:00:21.910 --> 03:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
this is like the most extensive change
 
03:00:23.349 --> 03:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
in state government
 
03:00:26.070 --> 03:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
that i've ever seen in house bill 2 in
 
03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
my six years
 
03:00:30.710 --> 03:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
madrid well i remember dread but that
 
03:00:30.720 --> 03:00:31.349 align:start position:0%
madrid well i remember dread but that
wasn't

03:00:31.349 --> 03:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
03:00:33.750 --> 03:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
creating 11 new positions net new
 
03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:34.790 align:start position:0%
creating 11 new positions net new
positions

03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:00:38.309 --> 03:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
that was an abolishing an important
 
03:00:40.389 --> 03:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
agency like the puc
 
03:00:42.950 --> 03:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
that i think has been well recognized
 
03:00:45.349 --> 03:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
for their work over the years but
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
why didn't you take this first to say
 
03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:48.630 align:start position:0%
why didn't you take this first to say
the

03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
science and technology committee they
 
03:00:53.349 --> 03:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
deal with puc electrical matters day to
 
03:00:53.359 --> 03:00:54.230 align:start position:0%
deal with puc electrical matters day to
day

03:00:54.230 --> 03:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
i trust their judgment or carol
 
03:00:56.640 --> 03:00:57.510 align:start position:0%
i trust their judgment or carol
mcguire's

03:00:57.510 --> 03:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
mcguire's
 
03:01:00.150 --> 03:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee executive departments and
 
03:01:00.160 --> 03:01:01.670 align:start position:0%
committee executive departments and
administration

03:01:01.670 --> 03:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:01:04.870 --> 03:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
and put the responsibility on the budget
 
03:01:06.309 --> 03:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
writers if you will
 
03:01:09.429 --> 03:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
to make a major policy decision such as
 
03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
this so i i just like to know what
 
03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
why push this through so quickly through
 
03:01:16.070 --> 03:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
the you know eight weeks or whatever we
 
03:01:17.190 --> 03:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
have in finance
 
03:01:18.630 --> 03:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
where something like this probably
 
03:01:20.389 --> 03:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
should require a greater review
 
03:01:22.710 --> 03:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
so i would argue that this has had a
 
03:01:24.389 --> 03:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
much more extensive review
 
03:01:25.670 --> 03:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
through the study commission that
 
03:01:27.510 --> 03:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
chairman bob or former chairman bob
 
03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:27.990 align:start position:0%
chairman bob or former chairman bob
baptist

03:01:27.990 --> 03:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
baptist
 
03:01:30.389 --> 03:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
led last year that specifically
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
investigated this issue
 
03:01:34.230 --> 03:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
we had an opportunity to sit with them
 
03:01:36.070 --> 03:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
that was science and tech wasn't he was
 
03:01:36.630 --> 03:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
cheering he was
 
03:01:39.670 --> 03:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
chair of science and tech so i mean
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
that subcommittee came to a mixed
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation to continue studying it
 
03:01:46.309 --> 03:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
partially because of the pandemic but
 
03:01:48.070 --> 03:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately there was
 
03:01:50.790 --> 03:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan broad support for the idea at
 
03:01:52.870 --> 03:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
some level of conceptual
 
03:01:55.910 --> 03:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
ness and seeing the opportunity now
 
03:01:58.150 --> 03:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
to build on the work that was done over
 
03:02:00.710 --> 03:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
the entirety of last session
 
03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
we've taken it in a slightly different
 
03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
direction not to include any parts from
 
03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:05.510 align:start position:0%
direction not to include any parts from
say

03:02:05.510 --> 03:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:02:08.710 --> 03:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
des like the air resource division
 
03:02:10.070 --> 03:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
i think that would be an even heavier
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
lift um
 
03:02:13.990 --> 03:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i would push back on the idea that
 
03:02:16.230 --> 03:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
this is more complicated than dread i
 
03:02:17.429 --> 03:02:17.439 align:start position:0%
think dread was
 
03:02:19.429 --> 03:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
even though you were splitting things up
 
03:02:20.790 --> 03:02:20.800 align:start position:0%
that was a much more complex
 
03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:21.910 align:start position:0%
that was a much more complex
reorganization

03:02:21.910 --> 03:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
reorganization
 
03:02:24.950 --> 03:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
than what we're doing given that we're
 
03:02:28.230 --> 03:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
merging existing functions of osi into
 
03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
this single entity
 
03:02:35.429 --> 03:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
and addressing policy concerns
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
about potential conflicts of interest
 
03:02:38.870 --> 03:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature i don't know
 
03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
03:02:41.910 --> 03:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
any more complexity with this than what
 
03:02:43.750 --> 03:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
oplc is currently doing with their
 
03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:45.910 align:start position:0%
oplc is currently doing with their
reorganization

03:02:45.910 --> 03:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
reorganization
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
and we can talk more about that i'm
 
03:02:49.269 --> 03:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
happy to do so representative
 
03:02:51.190 --> 03:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
but i think once we get to the actual
 
03:02:52.870 --> 03:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
org charts this might become
 
03:02:55.750 --> 03:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
clearer and simpler conceptually okay
 
03:02:57.670 --> 03:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
let me ask you another question we have
 
03:03:00.309 --> 03:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
105 104 positions here your second
 
03:03:01.750 --> 03:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
bullet point says
 
03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
four positions are unfunded which of
 
03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
those four positions where
 
03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
where would they fit in your chart do we
 
03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:10.710 align:start position:0%
where would they fit in your chart do we
have

03:03:10.710 --> 03:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:03:13.349 --> 03:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
four positions unfunded out of the 82 or
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
the 12.
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
out of the 105. yeah but where would i
 
03:03:20.710 --> 03:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
place them in your chart matt i see what
 
03:03:21.830 --> 03:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
03:03:24.870 --> 03:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh they would be between the
 
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
osi non-classified and the existing
 
03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:29.910 align:start position:0%
osi non-classified and the existing
positions

03:03:29.910 --> 03:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:03:33.190 --> 03:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
um okay and i can try to pin exactly
 
03:03:36.550 --> 03:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
which four live where yeah we can do
 
03:03:38.550 --> 03:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
that as you go across so i just want an
 
03:03:41.110 --> 03:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
idea where to look for those yeah
 
03:03:43.269 --> 03:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
and miss uh excuse me mr chairman woman
 
03:03:44.340 --> 03:03:44.350 align:start position:0%
if i may um
 
03:03:44.350 --> 03:03:46.150 align:start position:0%
if i may um
[Music]

03:03:46.150 --> 03:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
as part of i believe hb2 the new
 
03:03:49.990 --> 03:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh
 
03:03:51.590 --> 03:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
at least as we proposed had would have
 
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
expressed authority to reduce
 
03:03:55.510 --> 03:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
vacant positions and just to kind of
 
03:03:56.870 --> 03:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
keep talking about that the double
 
03:03:56.880 --> 03:03:57.429 align:start position:0%
keep talking about that the double
counting

03:03:57.429 --> 03:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
counting
 
03:03:59.190 --> 03:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
if you will some of that may be done
 
03:04:01.429 --> 03:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
here we need to cut 49 million dollars
 
03:04:02.710 --> 03:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to work with you guys on
 
03:04:04.469 --> 03:04:04.479 align:start position:0%
that because my next thing was going to
 
03:04:04.479 --> 03:04:05.030 align:start position:0%
that because my next thing was going to
be

03:04:05.030 --> 03:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:04:06.950 --> 03:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
you will be able to tell us which of the
 
03:04:08.309 --> 03:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
positions are
 
03:04:10.389 --> 03:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
currently vacant and not in the process
 
03:04:11.670 --> 03:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
of being hired for right
 
03:04:13.349 --> 03:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
correct absolutely and some of those
 
03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
vacant positions of the 14 that
 
03:04:15.990 --> 03:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
currently exist
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
may end up in in the uh you know to have
 
03:04:20.070 --> 03:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
the department
 
03:04:21.910 --> 03:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
function properly will need to be funded
 
03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
but a lot of those folks will be
 
03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
are not not funded filled uh from
 
03:04:27.830 --> 03:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
existing other positions and as people
 
03:04:29.670 --> 03:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
move out of those positions we we would
 
03:04:32.070 --> 03:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
anticipate and and fully expect that the
 
03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner would then
 
03:04:35.590 --> 03:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know unfund and get rid of those i
 
03:04:37.030 --> 03:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
think you can fully expect they won't
 
03:04:38.070 --> 03:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
all be here chris
 
03:04:40.790 --> 03:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
correct by the time you leave here you
 
03:04:42.870 --> 03:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
can fully expect they won't all be here
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
the senate always has more money they
 
03:04:45.990 --> 03:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
get business revenues i
 
03:04:48.150 --> 03:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know what's going on this is a
 
03:04:50.150 --> 03:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
process that's fluid but we got to meet
 
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
our deadlines with our things and
 
03:04:54.230 --> 03:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
you guys want to get what you want we're
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
going to try to do the best we can but
 
03:04:58.630 --> 03:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
we have some financial constraints
 
03:05:00.230 --> 03:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely and again i don't think we
 
03:05:00.870 --> 03:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
would ever
 
03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
plan for this department to be over a
 
03:05:04.550 --> 03:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
hundred people
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
like no matter how many quote unquote
 
03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
positions exist in the budget system
 
03:05:10.630 --> 03:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we would ever come
 
03:05:11.910 --> 03:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
remotely close to
 
03:05:14.070 --> 03:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
staffing a department like this at that
 
03:05:14.080 --> 03:05:15.590 align:start position:0%
staffing a department like this at that
level

03:05:15.590 --> 03:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:05:19.670 --> 03:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
um so that's slide seven
 
03:05:23.190 --> 03:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
on slide eight uh in
 
03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
addition to the questions that we
 
03:05:26.550 --> 03:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
responded to there are just some
 
03:05:28.309 --> 03:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
technical amendments between
 
03:05:31.670 --> 03:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
which positions exist in which um
 
03:05:34.870 --> 03:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
accounting units as well as the
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
potential to
 
03:05:39.269 --> 03:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
unfund additional positions we've
 
03:05:42.630 --> 03:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
identified some of those proactively
 
03:05:44.309 --> 03:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that i wanted to
 
03:05:45.670 --> 03:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
mention for the committee
 
03:05:47.670 --> 03:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
before we get into hb1 and go line by
 
03:05:49.190 --> 03:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
line the class
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
27 doit expenses we're engaging
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet and his team to
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
identify the best way
 
03:06:00.550 --> 03:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
to cost allocate those so the doit
 
03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
spent expenses as currently in the
 
03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
budget are correct
 
03:06:06.630 --> 03:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
just a matter of which accounting units
 
03:06:08.230 --> 03:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
pay for them
 
03:06:10.230 --> 03:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
so we're working through doit's very
 
03:06:11.590 --> 03:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
excited to be consulted
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
as part of this process um and we would
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
just want to bring forward a technical
 
03:06:19.750 --> 03:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
expense neutral amendment um you've got
 
03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
two days
 
03:06:24.389 --> 03:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
okay could happen okay two days
 
03:06:26.150 --> 03:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
i will talk with commissioner goulet
 
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:31.110 --> 03:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
all right and now to get into the
 
03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
position charge and if you don't make it
 
03:06:34.230 --> 03:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
happen here
 
03:06:36.230 --> 03:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to the senate okay if you
 
03:06:37.269 --> 03:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
want it here
 
03:06:41.190 --> 03:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
two days we will we'll confirm all right
 
03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh now to get into the position charts
 
03:06:45.349 --> 03:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
and i think this might make it easier
 
03:06:47.429 --> 03:06:47.439 align:start position:0%
for the committee to understand exactly
 
03:06:49.030 --> 03:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
03:06:52.070 --> 03:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
on slide 11 you see the
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
additions to bea this is page
 
03:06:59.510 --> 03:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
595 of the budget book you see these six
 
03:07:01.750 --> 03:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
positions that currently do planning
 
03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
functions at osi
 
03:07:05.269 --> 03:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
when commissioner caswell was here
 
03:07:07.590 --> 03:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
earlier in the week he mentioned this
 
03:07:10.630 --> 03:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
accounting two position
 
03:07:12.309 --> 03:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
it was previously proposed to go to the
 
03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
03:07:16.630 --> 03:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
given the bandwidth constraints of
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
adding six more staff for
 
03:07:20.630 --> 03:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner caswell's shop we would
 
03:07:22.469 --> 03:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
support the request
 
03:07:25.510 --> 03:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
to move that to bea um
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
and i know he has previously talked to
 
03:07:29.030 --> 03:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
the committee we can figure out
 
03:07:31.990 --> 03:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
the exact details um depending on what
 
03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:32.389 align:start position:0%
the exact details um depending on what
the

03:07:32.389 --> 03:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:07:35.190 --> 03:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
committee views on his party the only
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
thing we're waiting for in bea right now
 
03:07:38.630 --> 03:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
matt is
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
the small business situation which you
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
and i have conversed about
 
03:07:44.469 --> 03:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
so we haven't gone forward with his
 
03:07:46.950 --> 03:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
budget but i have an amendment coming on
 
03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:47.750 align:start position:0%
budget but i have an amendment coming on
that

03:07:47.750 --> 03:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:50.150 --> 03:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
um the other thing we did was we pushed
 
03:07:52.150 --> 03:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
the start time of his empty position
 
03:07:54.550 --> 03:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
it gives us some money but other than
 
03:07:55.990 --> 03:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:03.990 --> 03:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
on slide 13 you see conservation land
 
03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:05.670 align:start position:0%
on slide 13 you see conservation land
stewardship

03:08:05.670 --> 03:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
stewardship
 
03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
this would be page 192 in the budget
 
03:08:09.269 --> 03:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
book this isn't
 
03:08:12.070 --> 03:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
100 funded with dedicated funds it says
 
03:08:13.429 --> 03:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
page 129.
 
03:08:16.150 --> 03:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry yes page 129. okay i'm paying
 
03:08:16.160 --> 03:08:18.150 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry yes page 129. okay i'm paying
attention

03:08:18.150 --> 03:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
attention
 
03:08:20.630 --> 03:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
chris are you paying attention you
 
03:08:22.070 --> 03:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
should have caught me first
 
03:08:23.830 --> 03:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
um these two positions one of them
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
currently vacant
 
03:08:26.710 --> 03:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
would be administratively attached to
 
03:08:31.429 --> 03:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:34.550 --> 03:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
slide 15 is the division level
 
03:08:37.510 --> 03:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
organization for the department
 
03:08:39.510 --> 03:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'll start on the top left the office of
 
03:08:41.269 --> 03:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
the consumer advocate
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
again there are no changes there it's
 
03:08:45.349 --> 03:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
administratively attached
 
03:08:47.510 --> 03:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
the same would go for the adjudicative
 
03:08:47.520 --> 03:08:48.630 align:start position:0%
the same would go for the adjudicative
commissioners

03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
so those would be the three that rule on
 
03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:51.750 align:start position:0%
so those would be the three that rule on
dockets

03:08:51.750 --> 03:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
dockets
 
03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
we'll touch on their staffing needs a
 
03:08:56.550 --> 03:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
little bit later
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
you see the office of the commissioner
 
03:08:58.800 --> 03:08:59.750 align:start position:0%
you see the office of the commissioner
with

03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:09:02.790 --> 03:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
four divisions below them
 
03:09:04.230 --> 03:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
and then you see the site evaluation
 
03:09:05.750 --> 03:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee which would be
 
03:09:10.389 --> 03:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:13.750 --> 03:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
slide 16 shows the commissioner's office
 
03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is page 358 of the budget book
 
03:09:21.510 --> 03:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
two individuals both unclassified
 
03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
both would require governor and council
 
03:09:23.359 --> 03:09:25.030 align:start position:0%
both would require governor and council
approval

03:09:25.030 --> 03:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
approval
 
03:09:26.550 --> 03:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
neither one of those are filled at this
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
moment in time of course
 
03:09:30.469 --> 03:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
because there's not been a nomination
 
03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
salary for the
 
03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner salary for the commissioner
 
03:09:36.070 --> 03:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh again is included in
 
03:09:38.070 --> 03:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
the responses to our questions or to
 
03:09:39.750 --> 03:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
03:09:44.070 --> 03:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
um oh there we go 128 moving to 140 and
 
03:09:45.590 --> 03:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
deputy 128.
 
03:09:48.630 --> 03:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
why is the deputy going to be better
 
03:09:50.469 --> 03:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
paid than the commissioner in fiscal
 
03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
year 23
 
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
that is a a question that i'm working to
 
03:09:56.150 --> 03:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
resolve with das
 
03:09:58.950 --> 03:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
i don't i can't specifically explain the
 
03:09:58.960 --> 03:09:59.510 align:start position:0%
i don't i can't specifically explain the
increase

03:09:59.510 --> 03:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:10:02.790 --> 03:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
other than that they are at uh specific
 
03:10:06.150 --> 03:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
labor grades um in this case
 
03:10:08.950 --> 03:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
labor grade do you have people slotted
 
03:10:10.830 --> 03:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
for this that you think you're gonna
 
03:10:10.840 --> 03:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
for this that you think you're gonna
take

03:10:11.990 --> 03:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:10:14.070 --> 03:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
not at this time no the governor i was
 
03:10:15.349 --> 03:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
saying if you did
 
03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
but not name that might be a step issue
 
03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:18.710 align:start position:0%
but not name that might be a step issue
there

03:10:18.710 --> 03:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:10:23.670 --> 03:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
um it it could be a step issue
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner would be class iii
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
the deputy is class hh
 
03:10:34.150 --> 03:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
um we can address why the deputy would
 
03:10:35.670 --> 03:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
would see that larger jump
 
03:10:38.710 --> 03:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
but that appears to be anomalous
 
03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
because we wouldn't we wouldn't find
 
03:10:41.349 --> 03:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
ourselves in a situation where that
 
03:10:42.630 --> 03:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
03:10:44.710 --> 03:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
in reality yeah i would think that the
 
03:10:46.229 --> 03:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner would always be paid more
 
03:10:48.070 --> 03:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
than the deputy yes
 
03:10:49.990 --> 03:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
a small amount of money but that's just
 
03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:51.510 align:start position:0%
a small amount of money but that's just
bizarre

03:10:51.510 --> 03:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
bizarre
 
03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
yeah it depends who does the work i
 
03:10:57.190 --> 03:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
the work's been done right here what are
 
03:11:02.390 --> 03:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:04.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:11:07.830 --> 03:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh slide
 
03:11:09.990 --> 03:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative yeah i have a
 
03:11:11.830 --> 03:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
question uh where's your microphone oh
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:17.269 --> 03:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's been a long day all right
 
03:11:19.750 --> 03:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
director my you it's a french name sorry
 
03:11:20.710 --> 03:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
i'm french
 
03:11:24.870 --> 03:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay on slide 15 with the positions for
 
03:11:27.910 --> 03:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
division level organization you know you
 
03:11:30.150 --> 03:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
have three positions that are autonomous
 
03:11:32.550 --> 03:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
from that of the commissioner so these
 
03:11:33.670 --> 03:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:11:39.110 --> 03:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:40.870 --> 03:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
well when you do an organogram there are
 
03:11:42.950 --> 03:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
lines connecting and there's nothing
 
03:11:44.229 --> 03:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
connecting here so
 
03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
they report to themselves or correct and
 
03:11:48.389 --> 03:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
that's the current structure with the
 
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
office of the consumer advocate
 
03:11:51.910 --> 03:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
and the site evaluation committee
 
03:11:53.670 --> 03:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
they're administratively attached but
 
03:11:54.790 --> 03:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
they are autonomous
 
03:11:56.389 --> 03:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that clarification
 
03:11:58.469 --> 03:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you you recall
 
03:12:00.630 --> 03:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
das talked about that as well and they
 
03:12:03.990 --> 03:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
have some of those people
 
03:12:07.590 --> 03:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
yep on slide 17
 
03:12:09.349 --> 03:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
this is the division of policy and
 
03:12:09.359 --> 03:12:10.630 align:start position:0%
this is the division of policy and
programs

03:12:10.630 --> 03:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:12:13.990 --> 03:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
page 359 of the budget book
 
03:12:15.990 --> 03:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
you see here it would be led by an
 
03:12:18.630 --> 03:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
unclassified division director
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
and then you see the different staff so
 
03:12:22.229 --> 03:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
i'll go through this
 
03:12:24.630 --> 03:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
at the first level of detail the
 
03:12:24.640 --> 03:12:25.670 align:start position:0%
at the first level of detail the
weatherization

03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
weatherization
 
03:12:28.790 --> 03:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
program currently exists at osi
 
03:12:31.429 --> 03:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
would become a part of this division the
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy division
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
at the puc would become
 
03:12:39.990 --> 03:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
part of this division the offshore wind
 
03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
industry director currently exists at
 
03:12:42.960 --> 03:12:44.150 align:start position:0%
industry director currently exists at
bea

03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
bea
 
03:12:46.070 --> 03:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
it has been created but has never been
 
03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:47.510 align:start position:0%
it has been created but has never been
funded

03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
funded
 
03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
um that would exist in this division of
 
03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
policy and programs as well
 
03:12:57.429 --> 03:12:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:01.590 --> 03:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
100 federal would exist here
 
03:13:05.349 --> 03:13:05.359 align:start position:0%
the nesco manager deals with regional
 
03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
utility issues in iso new england
 
03:13:10.070 --> 03:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
currently at the puc
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
would become here the consumer division
 
03:13:16.950 --> 03:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
at the puc becomes here
 
03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
and a program planner from osi that
 
03:13:19.760 --> 03:13:26.830 align:start position:0%
and a program planner from osi that
deals

03:13:26.830 --> 03:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:31.110 align:start position:0%
 
with

03:13:31.110 --> 03:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:33.030 --> 03:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
there are no new positions here
 
03:13:34.790 --> 03:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
everything already exists
 
03:13:36.309 --> 03:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
and you see that three of these are
 
03:13:38.070 --> 03:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
currently vacant and how many of them
 
03:13:39.750 --> 03:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
are unfunded the win director is
 
03:13:42.630 --> 03:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
unfunded who else is unfunded uh so
 
03:13:44.950 --> 03:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
there are no there are no unfunded
 
03:13:47.190 --> 03:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
positions in this accounting unit
 
03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
so we we are funding the offshore wind
 
03:13:50.950 --> 03:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
office in this proposal
 
03:13:52.870 --> 03:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
but he is currently unfunded in this
 
03:13:53.990 --> 03:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
year's budget
 
03:13:56.070 --> 03:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
correct yes and who else is currently
 
03:13:58.150 --> 03:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
unfunded in this year's budget
 
03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
that'd be the only one in in this
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
proposal okay
 
03:14:06.469 --> 03:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:10.710 --> 03:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
slide 18 is the division of enforcement
 
03:14:12.870 --> 03:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
you see again an unclassified division
 
03:14:12.880 --> 03:14:14.710 align:start position:0%
you see again an unclassified division
director

03:14:14.710 --> 03:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
director
 
03:14:18.790 --> 03:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
the existing audit division at the puc
 
03:14:22.710 --> 03:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
would exist here the safety division
 
03:14:25.990 --> 03:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
at the puc would exist here
 
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
and the investigations director would
 
03:14:29.590 --> 03:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
exist here
 
03:14:31.510 --> 03:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
all of these positions currently exist
 
03:14:33.349 --> 03:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
at the puc
 
03:14:37.110 --> 03:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
and what i would note this is an example
 
03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
where as people move into jobs
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
in this new department there may be room
 
03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
to reduce the level of middle management
 
03:14:50.229 --> 03:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
essentially here because we aren't
 
03:14:52.229 --> 03:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
looking to force anyone out
 
03:14:54.550 --> 03:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
you have a division director a safety
 
03:14:54.560 --> 03:14:55.590 align:start position:0%
you have a division director a safety
director

03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
director
 
03:14:58.389 --> 03:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
and an assistant safety director that's
 
03:14:59.670 --> 03:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of leadership
 
03:15:02.550 --> 03:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
for what that division would need to do
 
03:15:02.560 --> 03:15:02.870 align:start position:0%
for what that division would need to do
so

03:15:02.870 --> 03:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:15:06.389 --> 03:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
as people either as vacancies either
 
03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
become available
 
03:15:09.750 --> 03:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
or as someone potentially would be
 
03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
confirmed as a division director
 
03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
this is an area we would want a future
 
03:15:16.710 --> 03:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner to identify
 
03:15:19.269 --> 03:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
for cost savings yeah i would think
 
03:15:19.830 --> 03:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
since you
 
03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded in other agencies that you
 
03:15:23.429 --> 03:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
would have unfunded some of those
 
03:15:24.870 --> 03:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
and just bitten the bullet and said
 
03:15:26.550 --> 03:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
sorry that job's going away i mean you
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
did it in other agencies
 
03:15:30.870 --> 03:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
so in this case with the safety division
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
safety director
 
03:15:34.950 --> 03:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is 100 federal funds
 
03:15:37.429 --> 03:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
we chose not to send back the federal
 
03:15:37.439 --> 03:15:39.110 align:start position:0%
we chose not to send back the federal
money

03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:15:41.190 --> 03:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
and what's the assistant safety director
 
03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:49.590 --> 03:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
and what's the director of enforcement
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's these going to be general funds
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
right nope so there are no general
 
03:15:55.590 --> 03:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
funded positions
 
03:15:59.190 --> 03:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
positions okay um the division director
 
03:16:01.190 --> 03:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
would be cost allocated between you
 
03:16:04.710 --> 03:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
utility assessment and federal funds
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
and just to stress there are no general
 
03:16:09.030 --> 03:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
funded positions
 
03:16:11.750 --> 03:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
at the division level across the board
 
03:16:13.110 --> 03:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
the only thing that has
 
03:16:14.710 --> 03:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
general funds would be the site
 
03:16:16.710 --> 03:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
03:16:18.550 --> 03:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
no they're not getting any general funds
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's the whole goal of trying to get
 
03:16:22.950 --> 03:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative leashman the chair is
 
03:16:28.950 --> 03:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
um on a trend that i picked up on like
 
03:16:30.469 --> 03:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
they take a little further
 
03:16:32.469 --> 03:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
have you identified each one of these
 
03:16:32.479 --> 03:16:33.830 align:start position:0%
have you identified each one of these
positions

03:16:33.830 --> 03:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:16:37.429 --> 03:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
federal other funds uh
 
03:16:39.670 --> 03:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the conservation i forget
 
03:16:40.950 --> 03:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
the name of it
 
03:16:43.750 --> 03:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
fund that would be used for those 2ds
 
03:16:45.429 --> 03:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
positions could you like
 
03:16:49.510 --> 03:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
not now but get us which funds are
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
being allocated like is it the 1.5
 
03:16:53.990 --> 03:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars that will be attached to
 
03:16:55.190 --> 03:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
the ratepayers
 
03:16:57.030 --> 03:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
so we know what these positions where
 
03:16:58.389 --> 03:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
the money is coming from
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
sure and as we go through hb1 i think
 
03:17:02.309 --> 03:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
that'll be helpful as well at each
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
accounting unit we'll see those funding
 
03:17:03.840 --> 03:17:04.790 align:start position:0%
accounting unit we'll see those funding
sources

03:17:04.790 --> 03:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
sources
 
03:17:06.469 --> 03:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
and those be cost allocated but happy to
 
03:17:07.830 --> 03:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
provide thanks
 
03:17:10.389 --> 03:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
man it's been very clear from the
 
03:17:12.309 --> 03:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
legislature that site evaluation
 
03:17:12.319 --> 03:17:12.870 align:start position:0%
legislature that site evaluation
committee

03:17:12.870 --> 03:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:17:16.070 --> 03:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
is to be self-funded or ceased to exist
 
03:17:17.830 --> 03:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
so it is not to be funded with general
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
funds we've put that into law we've
 
03:17:22.229 --> 03:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
tried to work with them
 
03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
i don't think they've been very
 
03:17:25.510 --> 03:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
responsive to that just thinking they're
 
03:17:27.190 --> 03:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
going to continually ask for general
 
03:17:27.200 --> 03:17:28.150 align:start position:0%
going to continually ask for general
funds

03:17:28.150 --> 03:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:17:30.870 --> 03:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
but that was clearly the intent of the
 
03:17:30.880 --> 03:17:32.710 align:start position:0%
but that was clearly the intent of the
legislature

03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:17:34.469 --> 03:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry i think i had misspoke
 
03:17:37.110 --> 03:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
there because if i go back to
 
03:17:43.990 --> 03:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:48.070 --> 03:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
see that's a view of having them taped
 
03:17:52.070 --> 03:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
together or stapled together we can find
 
03:17:52.080 --> 03:17:52.630 align:start position:0%
together or stapled together we can find
them

03:17:52.630 --> 03:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:17:56.550 --> 03:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
um so you see i i'd have to drill down
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
in the department of energy but yes so
 
03:17:59.750 --> 03:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
but none of these positions are general
 
03:18:03.750 --> 03:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.070 --> 03:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
and we we can drill down on the specific
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
yeah there's
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
no the intent legislative intent has
 
03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
always been to be
 
03:18:12.630 --> 03:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
no general funds into the site
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee they are
 
03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:15.110 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee they are
self-funded

03:18:15.110 --> 03:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
03:18:18.229 --> 03:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
generating their own funds yes and that
 
03:18:19.590 --> 03:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
that continues and i
 
03:18:27.870 --> 03:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:27.880 --> 03:18:32.389 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:18:32.389 --> 03:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee has given them a
 
03:18:36.870 --> 03:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
huge amount of money matt and i spoke
 
03:18:38.870 --> 03:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
about that earlier and i said that was
 
03:18:40.070 --> 03:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
not the intent
 
03:18:42.790 --> 03:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
and in both cases while i i like miss
 
03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
martin saying
 
03:18:46.469 --> 03:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
well i'm very fiscally conservative the
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
fact is she came to the fiscal committee
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
with a gun to our head
 
03:18:51.670 --> 03:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
i've already spent the money you have to
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
give it to me because the state had
 
03:18:54.710 --> 03:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
bills they would have to pay
 
03:18:56.950 --> 03:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's not really the way to do business
 
03:18:58.309 --> 03:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
you should come and say
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
i don't have money i would like to do
 
03:19:01.750 --> 03:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
this will you give me the money
 
03:19:02.790 --> 03:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
that would have had a different
 
03:19:04.469 --> 03:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
conversation i think with a different
 
03:19:04.479 --> 03:19:06.550 align:start position:0%
conversation i think with a different
output

03:19:06.550 --> 03:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
output
 
03:19:08.309 --> 03:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
but that wasn't the way the conversation
 
03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
went and i appreciate she's
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
works at being fiscally conservative but
 
03:19:15.670 --> 03:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
spending the money and then saying now
 
03:19:17.670 --> 03:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
give it to me i've spent it
 
03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
be like me telling russ i bought the
 
03:19:20.790 --> 03:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
ferrari figure out how you're going to
 
03:19:22.150 --> 03:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
pay for it you know that wouldn't go
 
03:19:23.590 --> 03:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
well my house but it's one of my
 
03:19:27.190 --> 03:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
um turning to slide 19 you see the
 
03:19:32.309 --> 03:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory division again an
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
unclassified director confirmed by gnc
 
03:19:37.750 --> 03:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit would be 100
 
03:19:40.150 --> 03:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
utility assessment funded
 
03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
and again i would just point to you
 
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
probably don't need
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
on a permanent basis a division director
 
03:19:47.910 --> 03:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
a bureau director
 
03:19:49.590 --> 03:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
and an assistant right so this is
 
03:19:51.190 --> 03:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
probably an opportunity
 
03:19:53.190 --> 03:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
to find additional savings from the
 
03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
current proposal
 
03:19:57.190 --> 03:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
those are filled positions there's the
 
03:19:58.790 --> 03:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
potential that one of those directors
 
03:19:59.510 --> 03:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
could move up
 
03:20:01.830 --> 03:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
into the unclassified the assistant
 
03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
could backfill them
 
03:20:05.429 --> 03:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
and you eliminate the assistant but
 
03:20:06.790 --> 03:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
because it's a governor and council
 
03:20:08.389 --> 03:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
confirmed position
 
03:20:10.870 --> 03:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
i can't sit here today and require that
 
03:20:12.229 --> 03:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
03:20:14.150 --> 03:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay we can just unfund one for you and
 
03:20:16.070 --> 03:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
then they can work it out
 
03:20:17.670 --> 03:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
could certainly be one option there
 
03:20:19.190 --> 03:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
would go
 
03:20:22.229 --> 03:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
we won't put that burden on you
 
03:20:24.630 --> 03:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
in the support division and this
 
03:20:25.590 --> 03:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
division is
 
03:20:30.150 --> 03:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
designed to be the back office functions
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
right so you see a division director
 
03:20:32.399 --> 03:20:34.309 align:start position:0%
right so you see a division director
unclassified

03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
unclassified
 
03:20:37.030 --> 03:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
at the very top row you see the existing
 
03:20:39.349 --> 03:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
executive director position
 
03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
and the existing general counsel
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
position at the puc
 
03:20:46.150 --> 03:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
those two individuals serve terms at the
 
03:20:48.389 --> 03:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
pleasure of the commission
 
03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
the proposal here is for them to fill
 
03:20:52.950 --> 03:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
out the remainder of their terms
 
03:20:56.070 --> 03:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
to assist with the transition
 
03:20:59.110 --> 03:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
and once that term ceases to exist the
 
03:21:04.469 --> 03:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:06.389 --> 03:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
in this division you see the business
 
03:21:10.389 --> 03:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
office you see positions related to i.t
 
03:21:11.830 --> 03:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
and again we're working with dennis
 
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
goulet and his team
 
03:21:15.990 --> 03:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we find the right
 
03:21:16.790 --> 03:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
people for
 
03:21:19.110 --> 03:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
for these types of roles to bring that
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
transformational change that we're
 
03:21:22.550 --> 03:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
hoping to see
 
03:21:25.670 --> 03:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
federal grants program administrator
 
03:21:27.670 --> 03:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh and other positions you notice that
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six
 
03:21:32.469 --> 03:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
seven of these are currently vacant
 
03:21:35.670 --> 03:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i believe two of which are
 
03:21:40.630 --> 03:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:43.750 --> 03:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
so manager i would like to inform the
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
governor's office that um
 
03:21:48.550 --> 03:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
this this particular slide just is not
 
03:21:48.560 --> 03:21:49.110 align:start position:0%
this this particular slide just is not
correct

03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't line up and it's
 
03:21:52.150 --> 03:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
virtually unreadable
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
at some point they just may want to go
 
03:21:55.830 --> 03:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
back and fix this slide
 
03:21:57.269 --> 03:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wallace
 
03:21:59.830 --> 03:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
representation you had a question
 
03:22:02.469 --> 03:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair and matt earlier in
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
one of the slides you said
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
one position would be abolished i
 
03:22:06.870 --> 03:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
believe and there'd be
 
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
11 new positions so i'm assuming
 
03:22:12.070 --> 03:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
maybe is that 10 or is that really the
 
03:22:13.750 --> 03:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
net 11
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
that would be established so
 
03:22:18.950 --> 03:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
one of these physicians like the
 
03:22:20.710 --> 03:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
executive director position the term
 
03:22:23.750 --> 03:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
ends within fiscal 22 the positions
 
03:22:26.389 --> 03:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
abolished at the end of fiscal 22
 
03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
for the general counsel the term ends
 
03:22:30.070 --> 03:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
within fiscal 23
 
03:22:32.309 --> 03:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
so the position is abolished in fiscal
 
03:22:32.319 --> 03:22:33.429 align:start position:0%
so the position is abolished in fiscal
23

03:22:33.429 --> 03:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
23
 
03:22:35.349 --> 03:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
so that's where you see that reduction
 
03:22:37.990 --> 03:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
of one is that abolishment of those two
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
position titles already in hb2
 
03:22:42.950 --> 03:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
it is yes all right i believe it's at
 
03:22:45.750 --> 03:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
the end of hb1
 
03:22:49.349 --> 03:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless it does exist
 
03:22:51.429 --> 03:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
michael nancy will you be able to find
 
03:22:57.670 --> 03:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:59.670 --> 03:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh if you're talking to me your sound
 
03:23:05.670 --> 03:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:13.670 --> 03:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:16.870 --> 03:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes i can hear you bill
 
03:23:18.070 --> 03:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
i just can't hear the room
 
03:23:22.229 --> 03:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
can you i can hear the two of you
 
03:23:28.630 --> 03:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:30.070 --> 03:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
well i'm muted because that's my
 
03:23:32.550 --> 03:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
computer is that better representative
 
03:23:32.560 --> 03:23:33.190 align:start position:0%
computer is that better representative
walls

03:23:33.190 --> 03:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
walls
 
03:23:36.309 --> 03:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
yes now you're back thank you um
 
03:23:38.710 --> 03:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
so the question i had was are you
 
03:23:40.229 --> 03:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
telling me that you're eliminating the
 
03:23:42.389 --> 03:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
general counsel's position from the puc
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
is that what i'm to understand the
 
03:23:44.880 --> 03:23:46.229 align:start position:0%
is that what i'm to understand the
current

03:23:46.229 --> 03:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:23:48.630 --> 03:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
position that is a termed position at
 
03:23:49.990 --> 03:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
03:23:52.630 --> 03:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
would no longer exist because the puc is
 
03:23:53.910 --> 03:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
an entity
 
03:23:57.030 --> 03:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
would no longer exist there would be
 
03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
lawyers that support the department of
 
03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:01.590 align:start position:0%
lawyers that support the department of
energy

03:24:01.590 --> 03:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:04.150 --> 03:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
then those would continue but there
 
03:24:06.550 --> 03:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
would be no lawyer to support the puc is
 
03:24:08.710 --> 03:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
that what i'm to understand
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't interpret it that way
 
03:24:11.990 --> 03:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
obviously the puc
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
will or the adjudicative commissioners
 
03:24:15.429 --> 03:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
will need
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
legal support for drafting for research
 
03:24:20.630 --> 03:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
to review their orders before they're
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
published those positions exist within
 
03:24:25.190 --> 03:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
the support division
 
03:24:26.810 --> 03:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
under the legal director
 
03:24:26.820 --> 03:24:28.550 align:start position:0%
under the legal director
[Music]

03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:24:31.030 --> 03:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
but the puc which would arguably need
 
03:24:32.790 --> 03:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
its own lawyer or general counsel
 
03:24:34.710 --> 03:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
whatever title you want to give it
 
03:24:36.550 --> 03:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
what you what i'm hearing you say is
 
03:24:38.550 --> 03:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
there will no longer be a lawyer
 
03:24:40.469 --> 03:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
within the puc to support those
 
03:24:42.389 --> 03:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
commissioners who themselves do not have
 
03:24:43.670 --> 03:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
to be lawyers
 
03:24:47.349 --> 03:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
but yet they are adjudicating matters
 
03:24:48.870 --> 03:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative walls and i think we'll
 
03:24:51.030 --> 03:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
touch on this when we get to slide 23 as
 
03:24:51.040 --> 03:24:52.469 align:start position:0%
touch on this when we get to slide 23 as
well

03:24:52.469 --> 03:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:24:54.950 --> 03:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
if the committee believes that you know
 
03:24:56.309 --> 03:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
there needs to be
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
lawyers specifically allocated into one
 
03:25:00.070 --> 03:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
of two buckets
 
03:25:01.910 --> 03:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
i i think there's an opportunity to
 
03:25:03.269 --> 03:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
explore that
 
03:25:05.750 --> 03:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
what i would also say is that in
 
03:25:08.630 --> 03:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
conversations with stakeholders similar
 
03:25:11.269 --> 03:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
concerns have been raised and as we
 
03:25:13.750 --> 03:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
prepare a technical amendment
 
03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
and work through this because again this
 
03:25:17.510 --> 03:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
is um
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know a proposal that we understand
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholders want to weigh in
 
03:25:22.710 --> 03:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately we all want to get to a
 
03:25:24.389 --> 03:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
workable product
 
03:25:26.550 --> 03:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
um that's something that that certainly
 
03:25:28.950 --> 03:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
is open to consideration but the
 
03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
existing position
 
03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
would no longer have a the position
 
03:25:34.080 --> 03:25:34.389 align:start position:0%
would no longer have a the position
would

03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:25:36.229 --> 03:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
the the role would no longer exist
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
because the public utilities commission
 
03:25:39.269 --> 03:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
as an entity
 
03:25:42.550 --> 03:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
would no longer exist
 
03:25:44.550 --> 03:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
i understand that the commission goes
 
03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
away i'm just more worried about under
 
03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
whatever name
 
03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
you continue it under that they have the
 
03:25:51.590 --> 03:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
support they need to issue
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
legally appropriate decisions we
 
03:25:54.479 --> 03:25:55.030 align:start position:0%
legally appropriate decisions we
certainly

03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:25:56.630 --> 03:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
share the same concern representative
 
03:25:58.950 --> 03:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
walls and again we feel comfortable with
 
03:26:01.590 --> 03:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
how we've put it forward
 
03:26:03.510 --> 03:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
if the committee wants to put more
 
03:26:06.150 --> 03:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
lawyers specifically at the puc
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
in addition to the support they get from
 
03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
the department of justice
 
03:26:11.190 --> 03:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
i believe they have two positions
 
03:26:14.309 --> 03:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
specifically dedicated to them at doj
 
03:26:15.910 --> 03:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
as well as their staff that we've
 
03:26:18.150 --> 03:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
established on slide 23 that we'll get
 
03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:19.670 align:start position:0%
established on slide 23 that we'll get
to

03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:26:21.510 --> 03:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
i would leave that to the committee to
 
03:26:23.670 --> 03:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
determine okay
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
those roles are very different the role
 
03:26:27.510 --> 03:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
that the ag's office performs and the
 
03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
roles that the general counsel performs
 
03:26:31.030 --> 03:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
are very different and maybe even
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes conflict with each other
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
it would be wholly inappropriate to
 
03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
expect the doj
 
03:26:37.830 --> 03:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
to fulfill the job that's now being done
 
03:26:39.990 --> 03:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
by the gc at the puc
 
03:26:42.070 --> 03:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
i thank you representative walls uh
 
03:26:44.630 --> 03:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
let's get to slide 23 and we may be able
 
03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
to clear this up mike and nancy i don't
 
03:26:49.110 --> 03:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
know if you heard me since we somehow
 
03:26:53.110 --> 03:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:55.910 --> 03:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
the budget director said that he
 
03:26:57.750 --> 03:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
believed in hb1
 
03:27:00.309 --> 03:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
was the abolishment of the two positions
 
03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
as their terms expired
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
and i just ask you if you could find
 
03:27:07.349 --> 03:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
that and confirm that with us at a later
 
03:27:09.510 --> 03:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
date not right now thank you
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
yes we can and on slide 20 four of these
 
03:27:15.760 --> 03:27:16.469 align:start position:0%
yes we can and on slide 20 four of these
positions

03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:27:21.349 --> 03:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
are unfunded of those vacancies
 
03:27:23.830 --> 03:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
so are we on slide 21 map yep so on
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
slide 21
 
03:27:26.550 --> 03:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
you see the office of the consumer
 
03:27:29.110 --> 03:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
advocate we're not making any changes to
 
03:27:29.120 --> 03:27:30.070 align:start position:0%
advocate we're not making any changes to
personnel

03:27:30.070 --> 03:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
03:27:32.070 --> 03:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
but in order to show you everything we
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
03:27:36.309 --> 03:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:38.070 --> 03:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
the only change is that it is now
 
03:27:39.590 --> 03:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
03:27:39.600 --> 03:27:40.950 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
department

03:27:40.950 --> 03:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:27:42.389 --> 03:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the public utilities
 
03:27:44.710 --> 03:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
commission so they get back office
 
03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
support from the department because of
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
that administrative attachment
 
03:27:50.389 --> 03:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
they do i believe they do most of their
 
03:27:51.670 --> 03:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
work in-house
 
03:27:54.830 --> 03:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
but the potential would continue to
 
03:27:54.840 --> 03:27:56.710 align:start position:0%
but the potential would continue to
exist

03:27:56.710 --> 03:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
exist
 
03:27:58.950 --> 03:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
um site evaluation committee is on slide
 
03:27:58.960 --> 03:28:00.870 align:start position:0%
um site evaluation committee is on slide
22.

03:28:00.870 --> 03:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
22.
 
03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a vacant administrator
 
03:28:03.520 --> 03:28:04.229 align:start position:0%
um there's a vacant administrator
position

03:28:04.229 --> 03:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:28:05.670 --> 03:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
and again representative over to your
 
03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
point you know we invite more
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
conversation on what the sec should look
 
03:28:09.520 --> 03:28:10.389 align:start position:0%
conversation on what the sec should look
like

03:28:10.389 --> 03:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:28:13.190 --> 03:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
um going forward might be best done
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
outside of the budget but but happy to
 
03:28:16.469 --> 03:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
to you know entertain those
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
conversations be happy to unfunded here
 
03:28:19.830 --> 03:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
and then you guys can come up with a way
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
03:28:23.190 --> 03:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if i would go that far
 
03:28:24.790 --> 03:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
given if it's general funds
 
03:28:26.550 --> 03:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to i've we've spoken about
 
03:28:28.229 --> 03:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
that before
 
03:28:31.990 --> 03:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay we can we can connect on that
 
03:28:33.429 --> 03:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the adjudicative
 
03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner so and representative walls
 
03:28:36.710 --> 03:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
i think this might
 
03:28:39.590 --> 03:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
away some of your concerns you see the
 
03:28:39.600 --> 03:28:40.150 align:start position:0%
away some of your concerns you see the
three

03:28:40.150 --> 03:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:28:42.469 --> 03:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
adjudicative commissioners at the top
 
03:28:43.990 --> 03:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
you see
 
03:28:47.429 --> 03:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
five classified staffers including a
 
03:28:49.269 --> 03:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
utility analyst ford that's currently
 
03:28:51.429 --> 03:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
vacant unfunded
 
03:28:54.150 --> 03:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
this positions are erroneous we in a
 
03:28:55.910 --> 03:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
technical amendment would propose to
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
abolish this position which position is
 
03:28:59.510 --> 03:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the utility
 
03:29:02.950 --> 03:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
the vacant unfunded position ah
 
03:29:06.790 --> 03:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
um they do have legal research
 
03:29:10.870 --> 03:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
assistance they do have an attorney
 
03:29:13.590 --> 03:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
and they have sick staff that fill that
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
advisory capacity
 
03:29:17.190 --> 03:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative leitchman to your
 
03:29:19.590 --> 03:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
point that help them decide
 
03:29:22.389 --> 03:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
and rule and write their orders but
 
03:29:24.550 --> 03:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
these individuals do not appear in the
 
03:29:25.670 --> 03:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
hearing room
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
right so they're on the commissioner's
 
03:29:29.269 --> 03:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
side of the table they're never
 
03:29:31.510 --> 03:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
appearing before the commission to
 
03:29:34.950 --> 03:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
present facts or establish the record
 
03:29:37.510 --> 03:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
their role is uh strictly support and
 
03:29:38.790 --> 03:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
and not advocacy
 
03:29:40.550 --> 03:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the advocacy is left to the
 
03:29:42.389 --> 03:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
division of regulatory
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:47.750 --> 03:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
well but i do want to be clear though
 
03:29:49.830 --> 03:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
that we want to establish a bright red
 
03:29:49.840 --> 03:29:50.550 align:start position:0%
that we want to establish a bright red
line

03:29:50.550 --> 03:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:29:52.389 --> 03:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
where you don't have someone that is
 
03:29:54.309 --> 03:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
appearing in a hearing room
 
03:29:57.190 --> 03:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
to present a case then also be able to
 
03:29:57.200 --> 03:29:57.990 align:start position:0%
to present a case then also be able to
advise

03:29:57.990 --> 03:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
advise
 
03:30:01.510 --> 03:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
that commission how they should rule
 
03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
right into your point looking at either
 
03:30:05.269 --> 03:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
federal board to the courts
 
03:30:08.309 --> 03:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
you don't see an a defense attorney
 
03:30:10.550 --> 03:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
present a case and then get to walk out
 
03:30:11.990 --> 03:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
back with the judge and help him write
 
03:30:13.910 --> 03:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
his opinion
 
03:30:14.790 --> 03:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representative
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
representation yeah man i'm sure
 
03:30:20.229 --> 03:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
um i've been before federal boards and
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
courts before and that's just not true
 
03:30:24.950 --> 03:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
but defense attorneys do in fact not to
 
03:30:26.070 --> 03:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
be argumentative
 
03:30:28.469 --> 03:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
do go back and sit with the judge when
 
03:30:29.990 --> 03:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
the public's not present
 
03:30:33.349 --> 03:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
so that's not quite true i think we'd
 
03:30:35.190 --> 03:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
both agree there's
 
03:30:37.349 --> 03:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
it would be better to have a scenario
 
03:30:38.950 --> 03:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
where that doesn't happen
 
03:30:41.190 --> 03:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
given ex parte rules and also just a
 
03:30:44.070 --> 03:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental fairness issue
 
03:30:45.990 --> 03:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
with these matters represent walls you
 
03:30:47.110 --> 03:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
have another question
 
03:30:50.229 --> 03:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
i do thank you madam chair um i'm
 
03:30:53.269 --> 03:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
concerned by the size of the staff
 
03:30:54.710 --> 03:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's being allocated to the
 
03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
adjudicative commissioners
 
03:30:58.870 --> 03:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
division and it seems to me that that's
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
a effectively a much smaller
 
03:31:03.349 --> 03:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
level of support than the current
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
commissioners get
 
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned that this is really
 
03:31:08.790 --> 03:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
not enough staff for them to do their
 
03:31:08.800 --> 03:31:09.349 align:start position:0%
not enough staff for them to do their
jobs

03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
03:31:12.229 --> 03:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
as they are currently able to do it and
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm just i'm
 
03:31:16.389 --> 03:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
very concerned about what we're doing
 
03:31:18.550 --> 03:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
here in terms of pulling so much out of
 
03:31:21.030 --> 03:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
the puc and and separating them from
 
03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
these people
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
i think there's perhaps more interaction
 
03:31:25.429 --> 03:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
than we think
 
03:31:27.590 --> 03:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
so i guess i'm wondering how the
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
assessment was done
 
03:31:32.550 --> 03:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
as to how small the staff
 
03:31:33.990 --> 03:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
would be at the adjudicated
 
03:31:35.590 --> 03:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
commissioners division
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
um compared to the kind of support they
 
03:31:40.469 --> 03:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
have now like who did that assessment
 
03:31:43.110 --> 03:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
so our office you know worked through
 
03:31:43.120 --> 03:31:43.510 align:start position:0%
so our office you know worked through
the

03:31:43.510 --> 03:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:31:45.670 --> 03:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
study commission that was done last year
 
03:31:47.110 --> 03:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
03:31:49.510 --> 03:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
what those roles would look like you
 
03:31:51.670 --> 03:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
know we've had conversations
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
to identify potential areas
 
03:31:56.790 --> 03:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
if it's the commission's prerogative to
 
03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
move more
 
03:32:00.469 --> 03:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
staff into this accounting unit and out
 
03:32:01.990 --> 03:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the support division
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
or out of the regulatory division
 
03:32:07.110 --> 03:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
i think we're open to working with the
 
03:32:08.630 --> 03:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
committee to figure out
 
03:32:12.309 --> 03:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
what those numbers are but again these
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
positions are purely designed
 
03:32:17.590 --> 03:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
to help advise the commissioners on
 
03:32:20.229 --> 03:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
their ruling these are not people that
 
03:32:21.510 --> 03:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
are compiling evidence
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
or building the record so for what this
 
03:32:27.750 --> 03:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
role and function would be and given
 
03:32:29.670 --> 03:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
that the commissioners are no longer an
 
03:32:30.870 --> 03:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
agency head
 
03:32:32.550 --> 03:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
right you have a department of energy
 
03:32:34.070 --> 03:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
they're not overseeing the day-to-day
 
03:32:34.080 --> 03:32:35.429 align:start position:0%
they're not overseeing the day-to-day
operations

03:32:35.429 --> 03:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
operations
 
03:32:37.910 --> 03:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
they're cordoned off allowed to sit in
 
03:32:40.630 --> 03:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
that adjudicative capacity
 
03:32:42.150 --> 03:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
we felt that this was an appropriate
 
03:32:44.630 --> 03:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
staff given what their new function
 
03:32:45.670 --> 03:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:32:48.229 --> 03:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
at the end of this transition their
 
03:32:50.309 --> 03:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
current role is much larger
 
03:32:51.750 --> 03:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
most of that now exists at the
 
03:32:53.750 --> 03:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
department level which is why
 
03:32:56.150 --> 03:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
we put a commensurate amount of staff
 
03:32:57.269 --> 03:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
directly with them
 
03:32:59.429 --> 03:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
and that current study and then that
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
study that was done in science and
 
03:33:03.429 --> 03:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
technology under chairman
 
03:33:05.990 --> 03:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
backus they recommended pulling them out
 
03:33:07.990 --> 03:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
and taking some of those administrative
 
03:33:09.590 --> 03:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
functions away from them so they could
 
03:33:11.429 --> 03:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
concentrate on this
 
03:33:13.190 --> 03:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
there were a number of proposals and the
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
committee never endorsed a specific plan
 
03:33:17.750 --> 03:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
but we did look at other states right so
 
03:33:19.670 --> 03:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
connecticut for example
 
03:33:22.150 --> 03:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
has their des and their public utilities
 
03:33:22.160 --> 03:33:22.950 align:start position:0%
has their des and their public utilities
commission

03:33:22.950 --> 03:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:33:26.070 --> 03:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
essentially combined that was one
 
03:33:27.990 --> 03:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
option that we explored we determined it
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
was not the best path forward for the
 
03:33:31.349 --> 03:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
and this was a alternative to again
 
03:33:36.389 --> 03:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
address those three policy concerns we
 
03:33:37.670 --> 03:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned up front
 
03:33:41.110 --> 03:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
establish a line of demarcation between
 
03:33:44.229 --> 03:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
advisory and technical to
 
03:33:45.830 --> 03:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that all these positions are
 
03:33:47.590 --> 03:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
governor and council confirmed
 
03:33:50.790 --> 03:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
to boost accountability and third
 
03:33:53.670 --> 03:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
to ensure that these efforts are unified
 
03:33:55.190 --> 03:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
under a single department
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
as it relates to energy okay so
 
03:34:01.590 --> 03:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
that concludes your powerpoint where
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
is your preference to go next matt um
 
03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
i guess just to talk uh
 
03:34:10.070 --> 03:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
i suppose about the questions
 
03:34:12.830 --> 03:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative over that you've asked of
 
03:34:12.840 --> 03:34:14.389 align:start position:0%
representative over that you've asked of
others

03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
others
 
03:34:15.830 --> 03:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
third document we've looked at the
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
letter we've looked at the powerpoint
 
03:34:18.389 --> 03:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at the questions and
 
03:34:19.830 --> 03:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
then we'll look at the budgets
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
yes uh so division one
 
03:34:25.110 --> 03:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry not division one we're in
 
03:34:26.870 --> 03:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
division one yes you are in division one
 
03:34:28.870 --> 03:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
congratulations welcome
 
03:34:32.389 --> 03:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
number one either way um
 
03:34:35.349 --> 03:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
so in this budget there is accounted for
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
moving expenses
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
and new it costs um
 
03:34:42.070 --> 03:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
i know the question is written to
 
03:34:43.510 --> 03:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
allocate those all to
 
03:34:46.710 --> 03:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
specific positions i can do that as a
 
03:34:46.720 --> 03:34:47.830 align:start position:0%
specific positions i can do that as a
follow-up

03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:34:49.590 --> 03:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
what you see here is just salary and
 
03:34:49.600 --> 03:34:51.750 align:start position:0%
what you see here is just salary and
benefits

03:34:51.750 --> 03:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
03:34:54.630 --> 03:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
mainly because the moving costs and the
 
03:34:55.990 --> 03:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
new it costs for
 
03:34:58.710 --> 03:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
setup and startup were not specifically
 
03:34:58.720 --> 03:34:59.590 align:start position:0%
setup and startup were not specifically
allocated

03:34:59.590 --> 03:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
03:35:01.349 --> 03:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
again we worked with doit we worked with
 
03:35:03.269 --> 03:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
das to identify what those costs would
 
03:35:03.279 --> 03:35:04.389 align:start position:0%
das to identify what those costs would
be

03:35:04.389 --> 03:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:35:06.309 --> 03:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
but in not in all cases were
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
specifically assigned to a position
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
so you're probably going to end up with
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
a budget that does not have
 
03:35:17.110 --> 03:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
class 39 class 27 assigned appropriately
 
03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
current state law allows an agency
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
to come to fiscal with their transfer
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
and with the establishment of
 
03:35:30.190 --> 03:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
classes so if you like don't get your
 
03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
telecommunications worked out for six
 
03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
months or something
 
03:35:35.750 --> 03:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's a way to come to fiscal and then
 
03:35:37.990 --> 03:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
have those budget adjustments made
 
03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i would concentrate your time we're
 
03:35:42.790 --> 03:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
most needed and not trying to get that
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
by deadlines
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that chairwoman and again
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
duits confirm that the total dollars
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
we're spending
 
03:35:51.750 --> 03:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
are in the ballpark so you've got them
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
in one bucket you can move them around
 
03:35:54.790 --> 03:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
when you need to by
 
03:35:58.469 --> 03:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
having the agency come to fiscal correct
 
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so you see the new positions their
 
03:36:03.190 --> 03:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
source of fund is also delineated here
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
in this chart
 
03:36:06.710 --> 03:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner it would be utility
 
03:36:08.630 --> 03:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
assessment and federal funds
 
03:36:12.229 --> 03:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
cost allocated through an indirect uh
 
03:36:15.990 --> 03:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
or intra-agency transfer of those funds
 
03:36:18.710 --> 03:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
the same for the deputy the division
 
03:36:18.720 --> 03:36:19.510 align:start position:0%
the same for the deputy the division
directors

03:36:19.510 --> 03:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
directors
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
depending on which division they're in
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
are either utility assessment
 
03:36:25.750 --> 03:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
or a combination of utility assessment
 
03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
federal funds and dedicated funds
 
03:36:31.590 --> 03:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
and then finally the six utility
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
analysts that directly support the
 
03:36:33.600 --> 03:36:34.950 align:start position:0%
analysts that directly support the
commission

03:36:34.950 --> 03:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
our advisory staff to the commissioners
 
03:36:38.229 --> 03:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
and they're 100
 
03:36:41.429 --> 03:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
funded by the utility assessment
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
the two positions we're eliminating at
 
03:36:45.429 --> 03:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
the outset
 
03:36:48.630 --> 03:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
are delineated here
 
03:36:51.269 --> 03:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
at the end of their current term and to
 
03:36:51.279 --> 03:36:51.830 align:start position:0%
at the end of their current term and to
chris

03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
chris
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
chris's point the commissioner does have
 
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
expressed authority
 
03:36:57.990 --> 03:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
to further reduce positions during the
 
03:37:00.150 --> 03:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
biennium as they become vacant
 
03:37:02.229 --> 03:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
and that would be our expectation of
 
03:37:03.750 --> 03:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
this new commissioner to take
 
03:37:06.950 --> 03:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's found in some section in hb2 yes
 
03:37:06.960 --> 03:37:07.990 align:start position:0%
that's found in some section in hb2 yes
i

03:37:07.990 --> 03:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:37:10.389 --> 03:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh as we go through it i can point that
 
03:37:10.399 --> 03:37:11.190 align:start position:0%
uh as we go through it i can point that
out

03:37:11.190 --> 03:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's about 40 pages of hb2 yeah i
 
03:37:14.950 --> 03:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
don't have all of them
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh memorized just yet but we'll we'll
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
get there yeah
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
they put me to sleep um
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
the answer to four was yes five was not
 
03:37:25.680 --> 03:37:27.030 align:start position:0%
the answer to four was yes five was not
applicable

03:37:27.030 --> 03:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
03:37:30.790 --> 03:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
um and this point with hb2 we cast
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
the broadest net we could on all the
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
energy statutes that
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
could potentially be affected in
 
03:37:39.590 --> 03:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholder conversation it's become
 
03:37:41.349 --> 03:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
apparent that some statutes have been on
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
the books since the 1950s
 
03:37:46.150 --> 03:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
and have never been used so whether or
 
03:37:48.309 --> 03:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
not we need to reintroduce them
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
or repeal them exactly so there may be
 
03:37:54.389 --> 03:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
additional amendments to hb2 as we work
 
03:37:55.830 --> 03:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
probably not something that will be done
 
03:37:59.510 --> 03:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
in two days but certainly during the
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
senate phase
 
03:38:03.510 --> 03:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
none of that will move the numbers in
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
hb1 at all
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
no and if you find those
 
03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
reasons can you just keep me on the
 
03:38:11.910 --> 03:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
mailing list even though it's come out
 
03:38:11.920 --> 03:38:12.790 align:start position:0%
mailing list even though it's come out
because

03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
it does come back to a committee
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
conference it helps if we understand
 
03:38:17.269 --> 03:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
03:38:18.950 --> 03:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try to get to the senate as
 
03:38:20.790 --> 03:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
much as i can but
 
03:38:23.429 --> 03:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
we'll have some house business too
 
03:38:23.439 --> 03:38:24.790 align:start position:0%
we'll have some house business too
understandable

03:38:24.790 --> 03:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
03:38:27.189 --> 03:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
um and then the remainder of this
 
03:38:27.199 --> 03:38:27.910 align:start position:0%
um and then the remainder of this
document

03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
document
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
is just again the class 27 conversation
 
03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
that we've engaged doit with
 
03:38:37.110 --> 03:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
um and then a series of position changes
 
03:38:40.309 --> 03:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
um either abolishing positions that are
 
03:38:43.189 --> 03:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
currently in hb1
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
um or moving positions between
 
03:38:47.030 --> 03:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
accounting units
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
either for a technical reason or in one
 
03:38:51.189 --> 03:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
instance a position moved
 
03:38:54.309 --> 03:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
in one fiscal year but not the next we
 
03:38:55.750 --> 03:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
would just want to align that
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:03.670 --> 03:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
and happy to talk more about these as we
 
03:39:04.950 --> 03:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
go through the budget
 
03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
okay where do you want to go next
 
03:39:10.870 --> 03:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
all right so i would say to hb1 if you
 
03:39:13.030 --> 03:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
want to do that what's the page number
 
03:39:15.750 --> 03:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
one second here i have it marked of
 
03:39:19.030 --> 03:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:22.389 --> 03:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
358 i'm surprised you hadn't memorized
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
that matt
 
03:39:24.990 --> 03:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
well i would i would actually start on
 
03:39:25.000 --> 03:39:26.309 align:start position:0%
well i would i would actually start on
129

03:39:26.309 --> 03:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
129
 
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
which is in the department of
 
03:39:29.269 --> 03:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
administrative services we did that one
 
03:39:30.070 --> 03:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
we're you're good
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:43.030 --> 03:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry yes 358 actually is where
 
03:39:48.309 --> 03:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
it begins
 
03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
so the office of the commissioner you'll
 
03:39:51.990 --> 03:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
notice that these
 
03:39:54.790 --> 03:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
are the expenses for two positions
 
03:39:57.269 --> 03:39:57.279 align:start position:0%
including class 39
 
03:40:02.790 --> 03:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:04.550 --> 03:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
all of the funds in this accounting unit
 
03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
are from agency indirect cost recoveries
 
03:40:10.150 --> 03:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
the idea is to leverage each funding
 
03:40:10.160 --> 03:40:11.269 align:start position:0%
the idea is to leverage each funding
source

03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
source
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
in a proportional way so a federal grant
 
03:40:15.269 --> 03:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
would pay a proportional share
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner's salary similar to
 
03:40:19.510 --> 03:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
the way it's done at hhs similar the way
 
03:40:21.189 --> 03:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
that it's done
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
at other departments that have a variety
 
03:40:26.389 --> 03:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:28.150 --> 03:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
you notice here that because this is a
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
new division there was no budget
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
tied directly to this for 20 and 21.
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm actually trying to figure out
 
03:40:36.389 --> 03:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
how you're going to pay these people
 
03:40:39.189 --> 03:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
first of july
 
03:40:41.590 --> 03:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
what do you mean representative ober
 
03:40:45.269 --> 03:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
so the the commission is
 
03:40:49.830 --> 03:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
the reorganization is effective
 
03:40:52.150 --> 03:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
september 1st
 
03:40:57.189 --> 03:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
so you have osi money in the budget
 
03:41:00.790 --> 03:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
so this is going to be a a technical
 
03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:01.670 align:start position:0%
so this is going to be a a technical
conversation

03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
03:41:04.870 --> 03:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
on how the transition occurs um
 
03:41:09.189 --> 03:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
there may need to be one-sixth of a year
 
03:41:11.269 --> 03:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
allocated to the existing structure
 
03:41:14.950 --> 03:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
while individuals are confirmed for gnc
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
because obviously this new department
 
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't be stood up on july 1st that's
 
03:41:19.110 --> 03:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
just what i said
 
03:41:20.469 --> 03:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i was wondering how you were going
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
to pay these people that is something
 
03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
that has also come up
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
during our stakeholder conversations yes
 
03:41:26.840 --> 03:41:29.030 align:start position:0%
during our stakeholder conversations yes
um

03:41:29.030 --> 03:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:31.590 --> 03:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
we you wouldn't see a net increase in
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
funds you would just see
 
03:41:36.550 --> 03:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
a uh you would see
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
osi and the puc continue and exist for
 
03:41:39.120 --> 03:41:39.750 align:start position:0%
osi and the puc continue and exist for
those

03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:41:41.670 --> 03:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
two transitional months is what we would
 
03:41:43.269 --> 03:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
03:41:46.630 --> 03:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
via an amendment to hb1
 
03:41:49.349 --> 03:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
alternatively and this wouldn't be our
 
03:41:49.359 --> 03:41:50.309 align:start position:0%
alternatively and this wouldn't be our
preference

03:41:50.309 --> 03:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
preference
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
you could have this take effect
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 23 only
 
03:41:58.790 --> 03:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
and fund the existing structure for a
 
03:42:02.389 --> 03:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:04.710 --> 03:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
but again that the idea being that there
 
03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
is a phase
 
03:42:07.510 --> 03:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
you're aware of the problem i mean i can
 
03:42:09.030 --> 03:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
see the problem when you flip up that
 
03:42:09.040 --> 03:42:13.189 align:start position:0%
see the problem when you flip up that
page

03:42:13.189 --> 03:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:15.990 --> 03:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
so again this this won't be an increase
 
03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:16.389 align:start position:0%
so again this this won't be an increase
in

03:42:16.389 --> 03:42:16.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:42:17.910 --> 03:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
in funding you won't have that fixed in
 
03:42:19.510 --> 03:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
two two days either so
 
03:42:22.229 --> 03:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
just keep me on the mailing list for
 
03:42:22.870 --> 03:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
what you do
 
03:42:24.550 --> 03:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
so when it comes back for the committee
 
03:42:26.710 --> 03:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
of the conference we have some idea
 
03:42:26.720 --> 03:42:27.189 align:start position:0%
of the conference we have some idea
what's

03:42:27.189 --> 03:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
what's
 
03:42:30.150 --> 03:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
in the division one what's been going on
 
03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
and we'll just proceed as though we were
 
03:42:40.229 --> 03:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
going to ignore that lovely little
 
03:42:40.239 --> 03:42:42.150 align:start position:0%
going to ignore that lovely little
glitch

03:42:42.150 --> 03:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
glitch
 
03:42:45.469 --> 03:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to it in accounting in
 
03:42:45.479 --> 03:42:47.030 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to it in accounting in
1887

03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
1887
 
03:42:50.950 --> 03:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
another note that i would make between
 
03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
the budget that you see in 20 and 21
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
because the pucs current structure was
 
03:42:59.520 --> 03:43:01.189 align:start position:0%
because the pucs current structure was
self-contained

03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
self-contained
 
03:43:02.550 --> 03:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
within a single accounting unit the
 
03:43:04.229 --> 03:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
entire agency
 
03:43:05.990 --> 03:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
we did have to break out those different
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
funding streams to try to give it
 
03:43:10.870 --> 03:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
some semblance of history so you'll
 
03:43:11.830 --> 03:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
notice the
 
03:43:13.429 --> 03:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
the increase is almost double in this
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
particular accounting unit
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
i would attribute that just to a quirk
 
03:43:18.870 --> 03:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
of how
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
we pulled or disaggregated if you will
 
03:43:26.229 --> 03:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
the prior puc structure which was all
 
03:43:27.910 --> 03:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
within a single accounting unit it would
 
03:43:29.910 --> 03:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
really be great if you could work out
 
03:43:32.830 --> 03:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
and get rid of all the double budgeting
 
03:43:32.840 --> 03:43:38.469 align:start position:0%
and get rid of all the double budgeting
before

03:43:38.469 --> 03:43:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:40.150 --> 03:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
it inflates the budget in a way
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be inflated
 
03:43:44.790 --> 03:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
and when you inflate the budget in a way
 
03:43:46.469 --> 03:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be inflated
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
then it's easy to say the next budget
 
03:43:49.990 --> 03:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
year well the budget only went up two
 
03:43:50.000 --> 03:43:50.790 align:start position:0%
year well the budget only went up two
percent

03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:43:53.349 --> 03:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
and people forget that uh yeah but four
 
03:43:54.790 --> 03:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
percent of that budget was double
 
03:43:56.469 --> 03:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
counted it should have been backed out
 
03:43:56.479 --> 03:43:57.030 align:start position:0%
counted it should have been backed out
so

03:43:57.030 --> 03:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
anything you can do to get rid of that
 
03:44:01.030 --> 03:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely and we can certainly explore
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
ways with das
 
03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
to maybe have a position um
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
that week i think they can help you they
 
03:44:11.910 --> 03:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
have to do some of that with doit
 
03:44:14.950 --> 03:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:23.910 --> 03:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
all right so i've turned to page 360 and
 
03:44:26.150 --> 03:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
so far i see you're using either agency
 
03:44:26.160 --> 03:44:26.950 align:start position:0%
so far i see you're using either agency
income

03:44:26.950 --> 03:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
income
 
03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
or federal funds which means you aren't
 
03:44:30.309 --> 03:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
really using
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
general funds which is what we
 
03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
concentrate on
 
03:44:38.070 --> 03:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
correct a variety of reasons um
 
03:44:41.590 --> 03:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
362 is agency income
 
03:44:44.290 --> 03:44:44.300 align:start position:0%
as is 363.
 
03:44:44.300 --> 03:44:47.030 align:start position:0%
as is 363.
[Music]

03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:44:50.070 --> 03:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
and while we are here actually uh the
 
03:44:51.990 --> 03:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
issue is pointing out with the reggie
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
dollars the increase in auction proceeds
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
you see that and i apologize that i
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
missed this this is on page 359
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
class line 73 and i apologize to go back
 
03:45:07.990 --> 03:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman it's okay you'll notice
 
03:45:10.469 --> 03:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
it's appropriated at 20.8 million in
 
03:45:11.189 --> 03:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
each year
 
03:45:14.309 --> 03:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
yep you notice there's nothing in
 
03:45:19.510 --> 03:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 the 20 and 21 appropriation
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
is found on page 361 class line 73
 
03:45:27.910 --> 03:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
just the same at 16.5
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
and 12.7 million okay
 
03:45:32.710 --> 03:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
and again this is just a matter of
 
03:45:34.630 --> 03:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
history trying to
 
03:45:37.269 --> 03:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
translate across different accounting
 
03:45:37.279 --> 03:45:39.349 align:start position:0%
translate across different accounting
units

03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
units
 
03:45:41.590 --> 03:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
so matt where's the first page that we
 
03:45:43.590 --> 03:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
see general fund usage
 
03:45:47.590 --> 03:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
in this new agency
 
03:45:54.550 --> 03:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
would be page 367
 
03:45:57.990 --> 03:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry 366 which is within
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
the division of administrative support
 
03:46:06.870 --> 03:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:14.389 --> 03:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
i would have to report back on exactly
 
03:46:16.469 --> 03:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
which class line that's attributable to
 
03:46:19.750 --> 03:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's all right just kind of looking
 
03:46:27.189 --> 03:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay 369 starts the site evaluation
 
03:46:30.720 --> 03:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
okay 369 starts the site evaluation
committee

03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
but they have general fund dollars and
 
03:46:36.309 --> 03:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
that's not what we want
 
03:46:39.990 --> 03:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
for them so you see the current
 
03:46:46.389 --> 03:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
their general fund dollars have been
 
03:46:50.469 --> 03:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
reduced yeah and they've got a million
 
03:46:50.479 --> 03:46:51.429 align:start position:0%
reduced yeah and they've got a million
more

03:46:51.429 --> 03:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:46:54.309 --> 03:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
as i said it was she works very hard to
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
keep it
 
03:46:57.990 --> 03:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
fiscally conservative but when you come
 
03:46:59.429 --> 03:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
and you say well you got to pay these
 
03:47:01.110 --> 03:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
because i spent the money you leave the
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
state in a hole and even if we don't
 
03:47:04.389 --> 03:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
like the way she spent the money
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have an opportunity to say no
 
03:47:09.429 --> 03:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
that's not something we want done
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
and man i'm sure you'll see the footnote
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
allowing them to come to fiscal to get
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:20.150 --> 03:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
and would just need to think about how
 
03:47:21.990 --> 03:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
those assessment dollars for the
 
03:47:24.790 --> 03:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
applicants that they would be able to
 
03:47:24.800 --> 03:47:25.510 align:start position:0%
applicants that they would be able to
fund

03:47:25.510 --> 03:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:47:27.269 --> 03:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
the operation sufficient they can fund
 
03:47:29.110 --> 03:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
those they can't come to fiscal and ask
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
for more money
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
that so that would not be coming to
 
03:47:34.870 --> 03:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal to ask for more money what
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
what representative leishma is talking
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
about is what has happened
 
03:47:39.990 --> 03:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
she's come and said i don't have
 
03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
assessment dollars so now i want
 
03:47:43.269 --> 03:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
the general court to give me another
 
03:47:45.189 --> 03:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
couple hundred couple i think we've
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
given her a couple million this year
 
03:47:50.150 --> 03:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
and always after the fact so no that's
 
03:47:53.189 --> 03:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
got to go away and somehow
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to leave that to you i've made
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
some suggestions to you about what i
 
03:47:56.960 --> 03:47:57.990 align:start position:0%
some suggestions to you about what i
think

03:47:57.990 --> 03:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:48:01.349 --> 03:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
they could do instead i'm not sure
 
03:48:04.389 --> 03:48:04.399 align:start position:0%
that having a committee meet to see if
 
03:48:06.550 --> 03:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
somebody is following the rules
 
03:48:08.950 --> 03:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to saying to des well they've
 
03:48:10.389 --> 03:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
got these permits make sure they're
 
03:48:11.830 --> 03:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
following the rules for the permits is
 
03:48:13.670 --> 03:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
the better way to go i mean i think
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
some of that work is duplicative of some
 
03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
of the great work that des
 
03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
does for us and i think we need to be
 
03:48:20.950 --> 03:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
careful about paying for duplicative
 
03:48:20.960 --> 03:48:21.750 align:start position:0%
careful about paying for duplicative
work

03:48:21.750 --> 03:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:48:24.309 --> 03:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
and i i appreciated those conversations
 
03:48:25.269 --> 03:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
chairwoman is
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
chairwoman martin from the puc on by
 
03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
chance i don't know it doesn't matter
 
03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
what's happened has happened this is not
 
03:48:33.189 --> 03:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
going to continue to happen that's where
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're going is going forward
 
03:48:36.630 --> 03:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not faulting her for what she did
 
03:48:38.229 --> 03:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
i'm saying going forward that's not
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
and just what i would say is the oppo
 
03:48:41.760 --> 03:48:42.550 align:start position:0%
and just what i would say is the oppo
the

03:48:42.550 --> 03:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:44.309 --> 03:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
alternative would be to increase those
 
03:48:46.389 --> 03:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
filing fees for new projects well then
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
you guys have to work that out
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay i would i would just say that
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
03:48:54.630 --> 03:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
only other source of money well she
 
03:48:56.309 --> 03:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
didn't use the filing fees
 
03:48:58.630 --> 03:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
for projects she needed the money
 
03:49:00.389 --> 03:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
because she was having hearings after
 
03:49:01.189 --> 03:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
the fact
 
03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
to see if they were complying with what
 
03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
the sec had already ruled and the
 
03:49:06.070 --> 03:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
permits they had gotten
 
03:49:07.910 --> 03:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
so she'd already spent the money of the
 
03:49:09.189 --> 03:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
filing fees
 
03:49:10.630 --> 03:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
and was doing that and then she said
 
03:49:12.070 --> 03:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
well i have some other things where we
 
03:49:13.750 --> 03:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
can review and track
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
those are the items you need to think
 
03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
about that's not necessarily a filing
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
fee that's a monitoring fee
 
03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
and if des has gone and is doing
 
03:49:24.870 --> 03:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
monitoring of all the permits that go
 
03:49:26.790 --> 03:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
out and the wastewater and all that
 
03:49:26.800 --> 03:49:27.429 align:start position:0%
out and the wastewater and all that
other

03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
they already have a staff to do that
 
03:49:30.870 --> 03:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
that we're paying for
 
03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be having a committee
 
03:49:33.910 --> 03:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
duplicate that
 
03:49:35.670 --> 03:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
i i agree with you i just want to
 
03:49:37.269 --> 03:49:37.279 align:start position:0%
identify and i believe there's a bill
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to get rid of this footnote
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i believe there's a bill that is
 
03:49:41.040 --> 03:49:41.590 align:start position:0%
and i believe there's a bill that is
currently

03:49:41.590 --> 03:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:49:43.349 --> 03:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
in finance it might even be this
 
03:49:45.110 --> 03:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
division or might be on the senate side
 
03:49:47.590 --> 03:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's proposing to reduce these fees in
 
03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
some instances
 
03:49:50.309 --> 03:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
that i don't think we have that and that
 
03:49:51.910 --> 03:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
would be in ways and means they deal
 
03:49:53.670 --> 03:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
with fees
 
03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
right so i believe it is already gone
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
out of the first committee but i'd
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
have to report back on that it may be
 
03:50:00.790 --> 03:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
03:50:02.950 --> 03:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
i do have my bill numbers here i have
 
03:50:04.830 --> 03:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
all the bills here that we have in
 
03:50:04.840 --> 03:50:05.990 align:start position:0%
all the bills here that we have in
finance

03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
finance
 
03:50:08.469 --> 03:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
um and i don't think we have one of
 
03:50:08.479 --> 03:50:09.830 align:start position:0%
um and i don't think we have one of
those

03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:50:13.830 --> 03:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
it mostly got deaths benefits we've got
 
03:50:17.189 --> 03:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
repaying fines right to know
 
03:50:21.429 --> 03:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
ombudsman payment of bail commissioners
 
03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
and more death benefits madam chairman i
 
03:50:24.880 --> 03:50:25.269 align:start position:0%
and more death benefits madam chairman i
believe

03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
the bill was in ways you were correct
 
03:50:29.429 --> 03:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
yeah my apologies
 
03:50:32.550 --> 03:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
we spend they collect
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's what my husband's doing that's
 
03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
why he always tells me just cut your
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:39.750 --> 03:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
what do you mean you need more money for
 
03:50:43.349 --> 03:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
all right we'll address that uh
 
03:50:46.840 --> 03:50:48.550 align:start position:0%
all right we'll address that uh
chairwoman

03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
chairwoman
 
03:50:50.550 --> 03:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
on page 371 you see the adjudicative
 
03:50:50.560 --> 03:50:52.630 align:start position:0%
on page 371 you see the adjudicative
commissioners

03:50:52.630 --> 03:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
again here a utility assessment would be
 
03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh which brings us down to 372 which is
 
03:51:03.590 --> 03:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
the end
 
03:51:06.870 --> 03:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
and again just want to stress that the
 
03:51:06.880 --> 03:51:07.750 align:start position:0%
and again just want to stress that the
totals

03:51:07.750 --> 03:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
totals
 
03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
on this page especially when it comes to
 
03:51:12.790 --> 03:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
the position count
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
the big change that osi non-classified
 
03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
positions are
 
03:51:18.870 --> 03:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
now they now appear in this line because
 
03:51:18.880 --> 03:51:19.349 align:start position:0%
now they now appear in this line because
we've

03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
we've
 
03:51:22.469 --> 03:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
reclassified them and then the
 
03:51:26.469 --> 03:51:26.479 align:start position:0%
total increase in other funds
 
03:51:29.830 --> 03:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
is by and large tied to the regional
 
03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas
 
03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
initiative auction which is projected to
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
yield more money
 
03:51:37.429 --> 03:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
for ratepayer rebates and that explains
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
the jump
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
along with the increase in federal funds
 
03:51:42.150 --> 03:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
that we're projecting to receive
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23. the intention is not to
 
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
increase the headcount of this
 
03:51:46.720 --> 03:51:47.830 align:start position:0%
increase the headcount of this
department

03:51:47.830 --> 03:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:51:50.150 --> 03:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
the intention is not to create permanent
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
increases in the utility assessment
 
03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
and again there are just some
 
03:51:56.469 --> 03:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
transitional pains that would go through
 
03:51:58.870 --> 03:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
something like this but we do believe
 
03:52:01.189 --> 03:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
that coming out on the other side
 
03:52:03.590 --> 03:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
once that transition occurs we'll have
 
03:52:05.750 --> 03:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for ratepayers
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
a more efficient department and also
 
03:52:10.309 --> 03:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
resolve some of those long-standing
 
03:52:13.830 --> 03:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
policy concerns that several people have
 
03:52:21.189 --> 03:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:29.300 --> 03:52:29.310 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:29.310 --> 03:52:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:52:47.830 --> 03:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:51.990 --> 03:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
on hb2 and these sections
 
03:52:56.710 --> 03:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:59.429 --> 03:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
and go forever and go forever but the
 
03:53:01.269 --> 03:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
reason we've done that again is that we
 
03:53:01.279 --> 03:53:02.389 align:start position:0%
reason we've done that again is that we
casted

03:53:02.389 --> 03:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
casted
 
03:53:05.189 --> 03:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
the broadest net that we could to make
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
sure that everything was in one spot and
 
03:53:10.150 --> 03:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
if there are functions that no longer
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
are applicable
 
03:53:14.309 --> 03:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
that exist in current law this will be
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
03:53:18.870 --> 03:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
and eliminate those outdated statutes
 
03:53:23.110 --> 03:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
our office has already begun that
 
03:53:23.120 --> 03:53:23.830 align:start position:0%
our office has already begun that
process

03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:53:26.070 --> 03:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
meeting with stakeholders soliciting
 
03:53:26.080 --> 03:53:26.950 align:start position:0%
meeting with stakeholders soliciting
feedback

03:53:26.950 --> 03:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
on what an amendment to hb2
 
03:53:31.830 --> 03:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't impact the financials would
 
03:53:33.670 --> 03:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
look like
 
03:53:36.630 --> 03:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
those conversations are ongoing and
 
03:53:38.630 --> 03:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders i would advise you at this
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
point to write the smallest
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
amendments it is better to have
 
03:53:48.710 --> 03:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
10 separate amendments that says repeal
 
03:53:50.950 --> 03:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
rsa xyz
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
than to rewrite this because if you get
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
to the committee of conference
 
03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
and you've got as many pages as you've
 
03:53:59.349 --> 03:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
got here matt
 
03:54:01.269 --> 03:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
it is very likely you would lose your
 
03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
whole department because we're just
 
03:54:07.030 --> 03:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
so pressed for time at that time
 
03:54:09.030 --> 03:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a single consolidated
 
03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah don't do that
 
03:54:14.070 --> 03:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay do make it as simple as possible
 
03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
so that as much as as we approve in both
 
03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
the house and the
 
03:54:20.790 --> 03:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
senate stands without us having to go
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
through and
 
03:54:25.030 --> 03:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
go page by page to nitpick so please
 
03:54:27.110 --> 03:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
i'd rather see 20 small amendments
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
repeal rsa 8
 
03:54:30.870 --> 03:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know what they're going to be
 
03:54:32.150 --> 03:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
then to make
 
03:54:35.349 --> 03:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
wholesale changes here okay i appreciate
 
03:54:35.359 --> 03:54:35.750 align:start position:0%
wholesale changes here okay i appreciate
that

03:54:35.750 --> 03:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:54:38.150 --> 03:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative i mean it it's a
 
03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
nightmare when you've got five or six
 
03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:41.030 align:start position:0%
nightmare when you've got five or six
days

03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:54:44.150 --> 03:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
to try to marry what you thought i mean
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know here's here's basically what
 
03:54:47.590 --> 03:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
happens the house is going to vote this
 
03:54:47.600 --> 03:54:48.710 align:start position:0%
happens the house is going to vote this
amendment

03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:54:51.269 --> 03:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
it's like sending a kid to college and
 
03:54:53.429 --> 03:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
then the kid comes back from college
 
03:54:57.510 --> 03:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:59.349 --> 03:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
you're the parent you're not happy so
 
03:55:00.710 --> 03:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's what happens at the committee
 
03:55:02.150 --> 03:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
conference phase so make it as
 
03:55:07.349 --> 03:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:09.269 --> 03:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
we have simple minds it gets late at
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
night we get cranky by 11 o'clock at
 
03:55:12.840 --> 03:55:13.990 align:start position:0%
night we get cranky by 11 o'clock at
night

03:55:13.990 --> 03:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
night
 
03:55:16.790 --> 03:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
so most of this is currently contained

in rsa 363
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%

utilities commission it's their charter
 
03:55:26.229 --> 03:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
because the puc is going away that
 
03:55:28.710 --> 03:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
statute as well as some others that
 
03:55:32.150 --> 03:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
are tied to osi are now consolidated in

03:55:39.510 --> 03:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
um commissioner i don't know i'm sorry
 
03:55:41.030 --> 03:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner i'm reading commissioner
 
03:55:43.030 --> 03:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
chairwoman i don't know unless you want
 
03:55:44.070 --> 03:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
the job commission
 
03:55:44.080 --> 03:55:47.990 align:start position:0%

03:55:49.830 --> 03:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
exactly why would i take a job paying
 
03:55:51.269 --> 03:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
less money i mean you know you're right
 
03:55:57.750 --> 03:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'm from finance i'll take more money
 
03:55:59.429 --> 03:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
chairman is your preference to go line
 
03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
by line section by section what's the
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
the best way to
 
03:56:05.349 --> 03:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
do something this large oh it's horrible
 
03:56:07.510 --> 03:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
line by line is pretty tough when we've
 
03:56:11.110 --> 03:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
if we can in general maybe
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
what we're doing we can see the
 
03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
definitions i'm on page 86
 
03:56:20.950 --> 03:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
obviously i've read the purpose i've
 
03:56:22.630 --> 03:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
read through this two or three times so
 
03:56:25.349 --> 03:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
this is not new reading for us we've all
 
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:28.720 align:start position:0%
had it we've all been working on it
 
03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:36.150 --> 03:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
the hard thing it is hard thing it is
 
03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
with this man
 
03:56:41.030 --> 03:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
is normally we see new language bolded
 
03:56:43.590 --> 03:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
old language and regular type and this
 
03:56:44.229 --> 03:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
is all
 
03:56:46.229 --> 03:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
pretty much all in regular type i won't
 
03:56:48.070 --> 03:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
say all of it because i'm sure if i did
 
03:56:49.110 --> 03:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
there'd be a
 
03:56:51.990 --> 03:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
thing in here that was new but this is
 
03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:52.630 align:start position:0%
thing in here that was new but this is
all

03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:01.910 --> 03:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
has some bolding yes so
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
you are you start at the bottom of page
 
03:57:04.479 --> 03:57:05.110 align:start position:0%
you are you start at the bottom of page
86

03:57:05.110 --> 03:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
86
 
03:57:06.870 --> 03:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
and you run through i think a bunch of
 
03:57:08.790 --> 03:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
positions about
 
03:57:10.710 --> 03:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
getting appointed how to be appointed
 
03:57:12.389 --> 03:57:12.399 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:57:15.349 --> 03:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
which is pretty boilerplate language if
 
03:57:15.910 --> 03:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
you might
 
03:57:18.309 --> 03:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
for as you said all the positions that
 
03:57:20.790 --> 03:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
go to gnc now
 
03:57:23.429 --> 03:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
is there anything in those sections that
 
03:57:23.439 --> 03:57:24.389 align:start position:0%
is there anything in those sections that
is

03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:57:26.790 --> 03:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
strange or only this one because when i
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
read that i thought that looked
 
03:57:31.750 --> 03:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
fairly every agency does that it is
 
03:57:32.950 --> 03:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
straightforward the only thing i would
 
03:57:35.189 --> 03:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
touch on are the initial terms
 
03:57:38.389 --> 03:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
that phase in so that once this is up
 
03:57:39.189 --> 03:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
and running
 
03:57:42.150 --> 03:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
one division director will come up each
 
03:57:42.160 --> 03:57:42.870 align:start position:0%
one division director will come up each
year

03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:57:44.870 --> 03:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
right so we're doing staggered four-year
 
03:57:46.870 --> 03:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
terms that's probably better you'll have
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
some continuity
 
03:57:50.469 --> 03:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
correct that's the only thing of note
 
03:57:55.830 --> 03:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.710 --> 03:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
page 87 line 28 the duties of the
 
03:57:58.720 --> 03:58:01.269 align:start position:0%
page 87 line 28 the duties of the
commissioner

03:58:01.269 --> 03:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
are pretty standard i would say
 
03:58:07.269 --> 03:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
um nothing unique to this agency
 
03:58:11.269 --> 03:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:13.510 --> 03:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
from there on page 88 the division of
 
03:58:13.520 --> 03:58:14.790 align:start position:0%
from there on page 88 the division of
administration

03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:58:20.150 --> 03:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:23.830 --> 03:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
on page 89 line 4 the state energy
 
03:58:23.840 --> 03:58:24.790 align:start position:0%
on page 89 line 4 the state energy
strategy

03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
03:58:26.229 --> 03:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
which is currently a function of the
 
03:58:28.150 --> 03:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
office of strategic initiatives
 
03:58:31.429 --> 03:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
in rsa4e becomes a function of the
 
03:58:34.309 --> 03:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
03:58:37.750 --> 03:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
so are you deleting rsa4e
 
03:58:39.910 --> 03:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes that is repealed i believe at the
 
03:58:41.110 --> 03:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
end of the energy
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
okay provisions all right so you have
 
03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
gotten some of that cleanup
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh just one note on the state energy
 
03:58:50.790 --> 03:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
strategy section uh initially that was
 
03:58:51.990 --> 03:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
something that was
 
03:58:54.710 --> 03:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh introduced in 2014 with a renewal
 
03:58:56.070 --> 03:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
after three years
 
03:58:58.309 --> 03:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
this does update that to have a new
 
03:59:02.309 --> 03:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:09.750 --> 03:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
yes if you don't think you're going to
 
03:59:11.590 --> 03:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
have everybody through
 
03:59:14.389 --> 03:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
gnc until in september you're only going
 
03:59:16.469 --> 03:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
to give them a few months to do a whole
 
03:59:16.479 --> 03:59:17.590 align:start position:0%
to give them a few months to do a whole
strategy

03:59:17.590 --> 03:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:24.150 --> 03:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
is a little premature given the fact
 
03:59:25.349 --> 03:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
you're reorgan too
 
03:59:27.510 --> 03:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that that you know 2022 could
 
03:59:28.950 --> 03:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
be something they worked on i do know
 
03:59:30.790 --> 03:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
that the office of strategic initiatives
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
in their current function of having to
 
03:59:34.150 --> 03:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
review it every three years uh
 
03:59:36.309 --> 03:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
has started to look at that process so
 
03:59:37.830 --> 03:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
they will probably have
 
03:59:39.990 --> 03:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
some lead into all right as you can hear
 
03:59:41.830 --> 03:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned about the length of
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
time of the reorgan then
 
03:59:45.269 --> 03:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
trying to have people meet a deadline
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
that might be unreasonable
 
03:59:49.750 --> 03:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair representative policeman i
 
03:59:51.990 --> 03:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
really like your idea of trying to
 
03:59:54.469 --> 03:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
push this a little ahead just going
 
03:59:56.070 --> 03:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
through my notes when i read through
 
03:59:56.080 --> 03:59:56.790 align:start position:0%
through my notes when i read through
this

03:59:56.790 --> 03:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:59:59.110 --> 03:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
there were so many references still to
 
04:00:01.269 --> 04:00:01.279 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission
 
04:00:04.389 --> 04:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
like i direct you to page like 103 line
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
17 the chairman of the public utilities
 
04:00:07.439 --> 04:00:08.070 align:start position:0%
17 the chairman of the public utilities
commission

04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:00:11.750 --> 04:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
shell obviously above that they crossed
 
04:00:14.070 --> 04:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
out the public utilities commission but
 
04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
in roman numeral four they left it you
 
04:00:18.469 --> 04:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
go to page 104
 
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
line 11 the public utilities commission
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy which i
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
thought we were eliminating the public
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
utilities commission so
 
04:00:30.389 --> 04:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of references through
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
again you go
 
04:00:33.670 --> 04:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
down to line 20 i underlined it same
 
04:00:35.189 --> 04:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
thing the chairman of the public
 
04:00:37.590 --> 04:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
utilities commission comma the
 
04:00:37.600 --> 04:00:38.550 align:start position:0%
utilities commission comma the
commissioner

04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:00:40.550 --> 04:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
of the department of energy so it looks
 
04:00:42.870 --> 04:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
like the public utilities commission is
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
still in existence so
 
04:00:46.710 --> 04:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
those are the things that give me a
 
04:00:48.550 --> 04:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
little pause because this
 
04:00:50.710 --> 04:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
division especially in the finance
 
04:00:51.990 --> 04:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee i've always looked
 
04:00:54.630 --> 04:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
at a good product coming out of here and
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
when i find mistakes like this this
 
04:00:58.550 --> 04:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
isn't a good product
 
04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that
 
04:01:02.150 --> 04:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative leishman and i agree
 
04:01:03.030 --> 04:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
technical drafting changes that need to
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
be made you know those are on my list as
 
04:01:06.960 --> 04:01:08.070 align:start position:0%
be made you know those are on my list as
well

04:01:08.070 --> 04:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:01:11.110 --> 04:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
in two days i apologize we didn't catch
 
04:01:12.550 --> 04:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
those during the governor's phase
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have to catch it and we've
 
04:01:24.229 --> 04:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:26.150 --> 04:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is that in some
 
04:01:27.910 --> 04:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
instances just a matter of changing it
 
04:01:29.830 --> 04:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
from public utilities commission to
 
04:01:31.269 --> 04:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
the adjudicative commissioners that
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
would continue to exist so again
 
04:01:35.910 --> 04:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
those issues are just references so so
 
04:01:37.910 --> 04:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
matt we're going to challenge you
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're coming back tuesday morning
 
04:01:46.389 --> 04:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
with dj yes to go over family leave
 
04:01:49.030 --> 04:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
bring the fixed amendment for that with
 
04:01:49.040 --> 04:01:49.830 align:start position:0%
bring the fixed amendment for that with
you

04:01:49.830 --> 04:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:58.469 --> 04:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
certainly because this to me it looks
 
04:02:00.150 --> 04:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
like a growth in government
 
04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
which has never been a big fan of mine
 
04:02:04.950 --> 04:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
as far as growing government but
 
04:02:08.229 --> 04:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
could you give us a comparison between
 
04:02:11.189 --> 04:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
the expense or cost of the puc
 
04:02:14.790 --> 04:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
and the expense and cost of the osi
 
04:02:16.469 --> 04:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
so we could see the comparison you've
 
04:02:18.630 --> 04:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
got new positions but it costs us so
 
04:02:20.710 --> 04:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
much for these two agencies now
 
04:02:22.389 --> 04:02:22.399 align:start position:0%
what is the department of energy going
 
04:02:23.830 --> 04:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
to cost because
 
04:02:25.590 --> 04:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing numbers here quickly
 
04:02:27.670 --> 04:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
reviewing it this is going to cost us a
 
04:02:29.110 --> 04:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
little more money maybe not all in
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
general funds as you pointed out
 
04:02:33.429 --> 04:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
but somebody's going to have to pay for
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
these costs
 
04:02:37.349 --> 04:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
i i agree and it's on the very last page
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
of the budget that we just reviewed that
 
04:02:40.070 --> 04:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
pertains to this
 
04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's 10 million dollars and and the
 
04:02:45.030 --> 04:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
explanation i gave just a few minutes
 
04:02:45.040 --> 04:02:45.670 align:start position:0%
explanation i gave just a few minutes
ago

04:02:45.670 --> 04:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:02:48.950 --> 04:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
was that 8 million each year is tied to
 
04:02:50.550 --> 04:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
the regional greenhouse gas
 
04:02:53.670 --> 04:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
emissions or inventory auction
 
04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
that is projected to yield more money
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
that is a direct pass through to
 
04:02:57.199 --> 04:02:58.389 align:start position:0%
that is a direct pass through to
ratepayers

04:02:58.389 --> 04:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
ratepayers
 
04:03:01.110 --> 04:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
so it's an increase in grants but that's
 
04:03:01.120 --> 04:03:01.750 align:start position:0%
so it's an increase in grants but that's
not

04:03:01.750 --> 04:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:03:04.150 --> 04:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
anything that the state has control of
 
04:03:05.670 --> 04:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's something we get for participating
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the program
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
and we rebate back to that fluctuates a
 
04:03:10.720 --> 04:03:11.349 align:start position:0%
and we rebate back to that fluctuates a
lot

04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
lot
 
04:03:15.030 --> 04:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
it does but our expenses are directly
 
04:03:18.150 --> 04:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
proportional to our revenues
 
04:03:20.870 --> 04:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
so that's the vast majority of any
 
04:03:22.710 --> 04:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
increase you see in the budget book
 
04:03:24.229 --> 04:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
the other thing that you see is an
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
increase in federal funding
 
04:03:28.870 --> 04:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
for weatherization and lie heap as a
 
04:03:31.110 --> 04:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
result of recent federal bills
 
04:03:33.030 --> 04:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
and the consolidated appropriations act
 
04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
that we saw pass in december
 
04:03:38.070 --> 04:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
and there is a as i mentioned before a
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollar increase in utility
 
04:03:40.560 --> 04:03:41.510 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollar increase in utility
assessment

04:03:41.510 --> 04:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
that is mainly driven by double
 
04:03:45.510 --> 04:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
accounting for some positions
 
04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
as part of the transition our intention
 
04:03:50.150 --> 04:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
is not to increase head count
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
it is not to increase the draw on the
 
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
utility assessment
 
04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i i would just use those three
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
things to explain
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
why it looks like there's a much larger
 
04:04:00.319 --> 04:04:01.429 align:start position:0%
why it looks like there's a much larger
increase

04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:04:04.550 --> 04:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
than we would ever support if those were
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
ongoing fixed costs for a new department
 
04:04:09.670 --> 04:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't come forward with a proposal
 
04:04:13.349 --> 04:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
to increase the department by 18
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no need to go down
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
that path
 
04:04:18.150 --> 04:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
but there are some anomalies that have
 
04:04:19.990 --> 04:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
distorted what that bottom line
 
04:04:22.070 --> 04:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
total looks like i'm pretty simple i
 
04:04:23.670 --> 04:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
just like to see simple
 
04:04:25.750 --> 04:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
no answers and i can strip out those
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
anomalies if you'd like and get it back
 
04:04:28.150 --> 04:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
just what we're seeing in that utility
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
assessment during the transition
 
04:04:33.189 --> 04:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to provide that to the
 
04:04:35.510 --> 04:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee thanks madam chair for
 
04:04:36.710 --> 04:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
allowing me to
 
04:04:40.070 --> 04:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
continue okay page 105. madam chair i do
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
have my hand
 
04:04:43.030 --> 04:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
up yes i know wait a moment this is the
 
04:04:45.429 --> 04:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
same thing it's a follow-up to
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
okay representative leitchman
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
105 site evaluation committee
 
04:04:56.070 --> 04:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
you have the commissioner of the puc on
 
04:04:56.080 --> 04:04:56.469 align:start position:0%
you have the commissioner of the puc on
there

04:04:56.469 --> 04:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
as well as adding the commissioner of
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
04:05:01.990 --> 04:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
i think you should make that nine
 
04:05:03.670 --> 04:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
members commissioner of department of
 
04:05:03.680 --> 04:05:04.389 align:start position:0%
members commissioner of department of
energy

04:05:04.389 --> 04:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
energy
 
04:05:08.309 --> 04:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
or an adjudicative member or of this
 
04:05:10.150 --> 04:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
and you don't want a committee of ten
 
04:05:12.389 --> 04:05:12.399 align:start position:0%
people then you vote five to five this
 
04:05:13.590 --> 04:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
is bad
 
04:05:16.229 --> 04:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
and get rid of that one line but put him
 
04:05:16.239 --> 04:05:16.950 align:start position:0%
and get rid of that one line but put him
on

04:05:16.950 --> 04:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
as you can see what was done with e
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
where's one of several people can come
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
that allows that to happen and when
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
you're doing your amendment
 
04:05:29.910 --> 04:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
let's fix that and i'd agree and given
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
that osi
 
04:05:32.710 --> 04:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
currently does not have a seat i don't
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
know that you would need
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
to increase the head count so right stay
 
04:05:38.229 --> 04:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
at nine and and we need to
 
04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
it says the commission or the puc or
 
04:05:42.229 --> 04:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
something okay
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
commissioners the commissioners of the
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
public utilities
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
commission the chairperson which shall
 
04:05:50.550 --> 04:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
be the chairperson of the committee
 
04:05:52.710 --> 04:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
well that committee goes away mrs martin
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
will no longer be the chairperson of
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
that committee because it's called
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
something else
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
so you need to work that out yeah and it
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
really should be annoying
 
04:06:01.990 --> 04:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
and we will fix those cascading
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
references yeah i just want to make sure
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
that got in because it piggybacked on
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
what peter was saying he and i had
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
picked up on some of the same things
 
04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative walsh you have your hand
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
up for a question thank you for waiting
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
i do thank you so much so i'm wondering
 
04:06:16.630 --> 04:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the word
 
04:06:18.309 --> 04:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
i'm using the wrong word but just as we
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes do a crosswalk on positions
 
04:06:21.910 --> 04:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if we can set up a
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
complete chart of dollar for dollar
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
where the money is coming from and where
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's going
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
so that we can see how much what the how
 
04:06:32.469 --> 04:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
much reggie's being increased where it's
 
04:06:33.670 --> 04:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
going how much is
 
04:06:36.309 --> 04:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
more the additional utility assessment
 
04:06:36.319 --> 04:06:36.710 align:start position:0%
more the additional utility assessment
and

04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
how much of this federal money might be
 
04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
a one-time thing
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that some of the federal
 
04:06:42.870 --> 04:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
money is not necessarily going to be
 
04:06:42.880 --> 04:06:43.910 align:start position:0%
money is not necessarily going to be
ongoing

04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we might set up this department
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
based on one-time federal monies and
 
04:06:49.590 --> 04:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
then find that we have to
 
04:06:50.950 --> 04:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
come up with that money in future
 
04:06:53.429 --> 04:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
budgets so there's an interesting thing
 
04:06:55.030 --> 04:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
with federal money
 
04:06:57.030 --> 04:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
it says if the federal funding money
 
04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
goes away
 
04:07:00.630 --> 04:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
you will not use general fund dollars so
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
what you would see in future budgets is
 
04:07:04.550 --> 04:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
things would be cut if that money goes
 
04:07:04.560 --> 04:07:05.189 align:start position:0%
things would be cut if that money goes
away

04:07:05.189 --> 04:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
represent walls i mean that's that's a
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
good thing to ask but that is the
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
standard practice and standard language
 
04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the state with those grants
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
and especially given that the federal
 
04:07:16.630 --> 04:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
dollars in this
 
04:07:18.790 --> 04:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
instance are weatherization and the
 
04:07:18.800 --> 04:07:19.750 align:start position:0%
instance are weatherization and the
low-income

04:07:19.750 --> 04:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
low-income
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
heating uh low fuel assistance for low
 
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
income individuals in new hampshire
 
04:07:29.110 --> 04:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
um low income home energy assistance
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
and that varies every year we see
 
04:07:32.389 --> 04:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
different amounts in there correct and
 
04:07:32.399 --> 04:07:33.030 align:start position:0%
different amounts in there correct and
osi

04:07:33.030 --> 04:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
osi
 
04:07:36.149 --> 04:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
pays out what they receive and not more
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that those fluctuate
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
you would there would be no change in
 
04:07:40.080 --> 04:07:41.429 align:start position:0%
you would there would be no change in
our

04:07:41.429 --> 04:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
status or our standard operating
 
04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
procedure for those grants
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
mike and nancy you heard mary best
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
requested about a crosswalk showing
 
04:07:50.790 --> 04:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
where they came from in the monies
 
04:07:53.110 --> 04:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
can one one or both of you work with the
 
04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director to get that
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
yes we can try to do that i've started
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
something that i can share with them
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right representative
 
04:08:06.309 --> 04:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
waltz we'll try to get that for you by
 
04:08:06.319 --> 04:08:08.149 align:start position:0%
waltz we'll try to get that for you by
tuesday

04:08:08.149 --> 04:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
tuesday

04:08:13.429 --> 04:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
was looking for
 
04:08:16.469 --> 04:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
i i just want to follow the money yep
 
04:08:18.149 --> 04:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
i got you we'll see if we can get that
 
04:08:21.030 --> 04:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
done by tuesday
 
04:08:25.349 --> 04:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
all right matt continue wherever you are
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i may i just wanted to
 
04:08:29.110 --> 04:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
clarify one thing that uh representative
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
leashman had brought up
 
04:08:32.389 --> 04:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
related to many of the references here
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh because
 
04:08:35.910 --> 04:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
the the adjudicative commissioners will
 
04:08:37.590 --> 04:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
retain the name the public utilities
 
04:08:37.600 --> 04:08:38.389 align:start position:0%
retain the name the public utilities
commission

04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:08:40.870 --> 04:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases uh the references that
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
remain are not
 
04:08:44.550 --> 04:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
mistakes they're there because that
 
04:08:45.990 --> 04:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
group of adjudicative commissioners
 
04:08:48.550 --> 04:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
will need to fill a role for whatever it
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
may be so they weren't drafting errors
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
so much as
 
04:08:53.110 --> 04:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
decisions that that group of
 
04:08:55.429 --> 04:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
adjudicative commissioners should still
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
remain involved we we don't disagree
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
that they should be a
 
04:09:02.469 --> 04:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
involved what we're talking about is the
 
04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
fact that you are actually replacing
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
them and giving them a new title
 
04:09:08.710 --> 04:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
and we had this issue with dread you
 
04:09:08.720 --> 04:09:09.269 align:start position:0%
and we had this issue with dread you
guys

04:09:09.269 --> 04:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
guys
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
weren't here then but nathan white at
 
04:09:12.000 --> 04:09:13.429 align:start position:0%
weren't here then but nathan white at
lba

04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
lba
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
had to go through i can't tell you how
 
04:09:17.590 --> 04:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
many pages and verify the language
 
04:09:19.030 --> 04:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
across all of the things
 
04:09:20.870 --> 04:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
equally peter and i were sitting on the
 
04:09:22.630 --> 04:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
committee at that time it was
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
a huge overhaul so it's it's just
 
04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
something that we need to
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
correct and make right
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
and we're happy to do that we understand
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
it you're going to have it but
 
04:09:39.910 --> 04:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's got to be right uh i'll go to page
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
90 from there
 
04:09:43.590 --> 04:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
the office of offshore wind industry now
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
is that new
 
04:09:47.189 --> 04:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
yes this was passed it was senate bill
 
04:09:47.199 --> 04:09:48.309 align:start position:0%
yes this was passed it was senate bill
668

04:09:48.309 --> 04:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
668
 
04:09:50.550 --> 04:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
last session that was bundled into house
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
bill 1245
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
that died that was signed into law there
 
04:09:57.030 --> 04:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
was no appropriation
 
04:10:00.070 --> 04:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
it was signed in the law yes
 
04:10:03.110 --> 04:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
12 45 yeah so there exists this office
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's not funded
 
04:10:04.319 --> 04:10:07.670 align:start position:0%
it's not funded
currently

04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
this was a senator waters bill from last
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
but that never came to the house really
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
never had a public hearing
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh correct and why is this in here if it
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
exists in state law
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
because we are repealing rsa 363
 
04:10:26.070 --> 04:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
as well as some others what and unifying
 
04:10:26.080 --> 04:10:26.710 align:start position:0%
as well as some others what and unifying
this

04:10:26.710 --> 04:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:10:29.429 --> 04:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
what's that number i'm on the repeal
 
04:10:33.469 --> 04:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
363 and this
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
this particular item might be in another
 
04:10:40.550 --> 04:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
statute i i don't know exactly where
 
04:10:43.750 --> 04:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
this was codified it might be 374
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
h but i i would check the reference for
 
04:10:47.520 --> 04:10:49.429 align:start position:0%
h but i i would check the reference for
you

04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't see that here at the
 
04:11:08.710 --> 04:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.189 --> 04:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
okay let's go on you see the additional
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
divisions again that's boilerplate
 
04:11:20.000 --> 04:11:26.149 align:start position:0%
divisions again that's boilerplate
language

04:11:26.149 --> 04:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:28.870 --> 04:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
page 91 talks about natural gas and the
 
04:11:32.229 --> 04:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:34.469 --> 04:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
with the commission and that was
 
04:11:36.389 --> 04:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
existing law already that you moved
 
04:11:36.399 --> 04:11:36.710 align:start position:0%
existing law already that you moved
right

04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
yes almost none of this is new language
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
if anything i i couldn't point to a
 
04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
piece of new language that's not
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
currently on the books
 
04:11:47.349 --> 04:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
again this is really translating from
 
04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
one structure of government to another
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
um on page 92 line three this is a
 
04:11:53.920 --> 04:11:54.630 align:start position:0%
um on page 92 line three this is a
statute

04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
that was introduced in the 50s amended
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
in 79
 
04:12:00.790 --> 04:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
and no one can point to a time in which
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
used um this might be an opportunity
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
just to repeal it as well
 
04:12:08.950 --> 04:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're working with stakeholders to
 
04:12:11.349 --> 04:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
identify if there's a compelling reason
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
to keep it on the books or not so line 3
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
through 12
 
04:12:14.840 --> 04:12:21.910 align:start position:0%
through 12
yes

04:12:21.910 --> 04:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.830 --> 04:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.840 --> 04:12:34.469 align:start position:0%
 
conversations

04:12:34.469 --> 04:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh at the bottom of 92 you see the
 
04:12:37.590 --> 04:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
governor's scholarship program
 
04:12:39.269 --> 04:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
this is a program that used to exist at
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
osi osi is going away
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
so it renames the chapter title
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
to account for that that's now in
 
04:12:50.080 --> 04:12:50.950 align:start position:0%
to account for that that's now in
treasury

04:12:50.950 --> 04:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
04:12:54.790 --> 04:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
yeah uh 194
 
04:12:57.110 --> 04:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
or page 93 top page three is just the
 
04:12:58.630 --> 04:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
organizational structure the executive
 
04:12:58.640 --> 04:13:00.870 align:start position:0%
organizational structure the executive
branch

04:13:00.870 --> 04:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
branch
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
you see the positions that we've created
 
04:13:02.880 --> 04:13:11.110 align:start position:0%
you see the positions that we've created
here

04:13:11.110 --> 04:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:13.590 --> 04:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
page 94 moves the division of planning
 
04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
to the department of business and
 
04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.030 --> 04:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
the subsequent section details existing
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
authority that the division of planning
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
has at osi
 
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
that they would continue to have at the
 
04:13:28.149 --> 04:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
department of business and economic
 
04:13:28.159 --> 04:13:30.309 align:start position:0%
department of business and economic
affairs

04:13:30.309 --> 04:13:30.319 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
04:13:36.630 --> 04:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:45.670 --> 04:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
continuing forward to 97 still existing
 
04:13:52.830 --> 04:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:52.840 --> 04:13:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
has

04:13:54.070 --> 04:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:13:56.309 --> 04:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
section 200 is the name of the
 
04:13:56.319 --> 04:13:57.910 align:start position:0%
section 200 is the name of the
department

04:13:57.910 --> 04:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:14:00.229 --> 04:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
which replaces osi with department of
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:10.469 --> 04:14:10.479 align:start position:0%
line 8 on page 98 changes a reference
 
04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is related to the state energy
 
04:14:33.510 --> 04:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:37.750 --> 04:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
back up to wherever you want we'll go
 
04:14:40.710 --> 04:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite familiar with the policies
 
04:14:44.309 --> 04:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
and plans it's in the bottom of page 95
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
line 34 and going over to 96
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things listed
 
04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
which are done by
 
04:14:55.750 --> 04:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
other departments in the state so
 
04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
is that existing language there now that
 
04:15:01.110 --> 04:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
you're just moving over or is this
 
04:15:01.120 --> 04:15:02.550 align:start position:0%
you're just moving over or is this
creating

04:15:02.550 --> 04:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
creating
 
04:15:05.590 --> 04:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
more oversight of all these
 
04:15:09.110 --> 04:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
a through j which again
 
04:15:10.950 --> 04:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
some of them have already are handled by
 
04:15:13.349 --> 04:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
other agencies like water resources or
 
04:15:15.030 --> 04:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
solid waste
 
04:15:17.269 --> 04:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
i'll verify the existing rsa that this
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
04:15:22.309 --> 04:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
but it is existing language okay thanks
 
04:15:24.950 --> 04:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair i think we did that
 
04:15:24.960 --> 04:15:26.070 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair i think we did that
piece

04:15:26.070 --> 04:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
piece
 
04:15:29.349 --> 04:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
when osi was created and planning moved
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
man i think you've got serious problem
 
04:15:54.870 --> 04:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
section 207 really cannot say public
 
04:15:59.990 --> 04:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
utilities commission quorum because
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
now your new adjudicators won't have a
 
04:16:02.000 --> 04:16:05.269 align:start position:0%
now your new adjudicators won't have a
quorum

04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
so be sure you try when you fix that
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:19.110 --> 04:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
and we start you've got in 206
 
04:16:22.229 --> 04:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
207 208
 
04:16:24.309 --> 04:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
your specified public utilities
 
04:16:24.319 --> 04:16:25.349 align:start position:0%
your specified public utilities
commission

04:16:25.349 --> 04:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:16:27.189 --> 04:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
since that's actually going away you
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
want to be sure your your new
 
04:16:30.309 --> 04:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
adjudicative division
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
has got a quorum has got this has got
 
04:16:32.479 --> 04:16:33.349 align:start position:0%
has got a quorum has got this has got
that

04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
and what i would say and again this is
 
04:16:37.750 --> 04:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
something that will cascade through
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
on section 204 you see puc
 
04:16:44.710 --> 04:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
remains a defined term
 
04:16:48.309 --> 04:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
to articulate that we are changing this
 
04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
i would agree
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
it should be renamed to the adjudicative
 
04:16:53.600 --> 04:16:54.870 align:start position:0%
it should be renamed to the adjudicative
commissioners

04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
04:16:57.429 --> 04:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
and cascade through yeah but that's why
 
04:16:59.110 --> 04:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
it appears the way that it does
 
04:17:01.750 --> 04:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
throughout but i i do agree with the
 
04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative leashman and yourself
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
that we should clarify
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
that it's not the existing entity it is
 
04:17:09.429 --> 04:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
the new entity right someday you and i
 
04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
won't be sitting here it needs to be
 
04:17:11.279 --> 04:17:12.630 align:start position:0%
won't be sitting here it needs to be
clear

04:17:12.630 --> 04:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:17:12.640 --> 04:17:19.670 align:start position:0%
clear
absolutely

04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:21.830 --> 04:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
and somebody ought to be able to do a
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
control f
 
04:17:25.910 --> 04:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
find all these or even ctrl r and
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
replace it with this phrase and pop it
 
04:17:28.080 --> 04:17:28.710 align:start position:0%
replace it with this phrase and pop it
in

04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:17:30.790 --> 04:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
i mean that's computers are great at
 
04:17:34.389 --> 04:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:38.070 --> 04:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
represent walls yeah i have a concern i
 
04:17:39.189 --> 04:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
just want to raise
 
04:17:43.590 --> 04:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
um it looks like that um 363-1
 
04:17:45.189 --> 04:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
is making the chair of the commissioner
 
04:17:47.110 --> 04:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
report directly to the governor
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
does matt mean the governor could
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
influence the commission which is
 
04:17:51.990 --> 04:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be independent
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's my concern with the way this is
 
04:17:53.520 --> 04:18:00.950 align:start position:0%
that's my concern with the way this is
drafted

04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative walls which is
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
the governor on
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
on page 99 yeah i got it what line
 
04:18:06.800 --> 04:18:07.429 align:start position:0%
on page 99 yeah i got it what line
number

04:18:07.429 --> 04:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
four lines at the beginning so it's 363
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
one commission term in there doesn't it
 
04:18:14.980 --> 04:18:14.990 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
04:18:14.990 --> 04:18:18.830 align:start position:0%
talk about
[Music]

04:18:18.830 --> 04:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:18.840 --> 04:18:20.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:18:20.469 --> 04:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:22.630 --> 04:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see it saying one reports to the
 
04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
governor that's what i'm missing
 
04:18:28.149 --> 04:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
all right maybe i've got my notes wrong
 
04:18:28.159 --> 04:18:30.870 align:start position:0%
all right maybe i've got my notes wrong
um

04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:34.149 --> 04:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
try what about don on line
 
04:18:34.159 --> 04:18:37.349 align:start position:0%
try what about don on line
67

04:18:37.349 --> 04:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know let me get back to my notes
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
and i'll come back to this okay
 
04:18:50.309 --> 04:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:51.990 --> 04:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
all right please continue matt she's
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
gonna look i don't know i didn't see
 
04:18:55.590 --> 04:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
that so
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
we don't all see everything so if she
 
04:19:02.149 --> 04:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
finds it we'll go back to it
 
04:19:03.990 --> 04:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
and the other thing representative ober
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
that we might do
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
through this amendment is consolidate
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
the repeals
 
04:19:11.189 --> 04:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
into a single series of consecutive
 
04:19:11.199 --> 04:19:11.990 align:start position:0%
into a single series of consecutive
sections

04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
sections
 
04:19:15.349 --> 04:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
easier to deal with for sure yeah but
 
04:19:15.990 --> 04:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
again you
 
04:19:18.630 --> 04:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
got to get this done by tuesday so my
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
what can you do to get it done by
 
04:19:25.990 --> 04:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
tuesday morning
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
and you gotta make that decision i can't
 
04:19:30.630 --> 04:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
do it for you
 
04:19:42.550 --> 04:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:45.429 --> 04:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
on page 100 you see the repeal of the
 
04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
sections that directly relate to those
 
04:19:49.349 --> 04:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
positions that would no longer exist
 
04:19:53.110 --> 04:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
yep the office the consumer advocate all
 
04:19:54.309 --> 04:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
we're changing here is its
 
04:19:55.830 --> 04:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
administrative attachment
 
04:20:04.070 --> 04:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:08.070 --> 04:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
that continues on page 101 yeah
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
just a series of reference changes yeah
 
04:20:16.389 --> 04:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:25.269 --> 04:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:30.790 --> 04:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:32.229 --> 04:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
we've noted the concern on the site
 
04:20:51.429 --> 04:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:54.389 --> 04:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of the rest of this is that
 
04:20:54.399 --> 04:20:55.030 align:start position:0%
a lot of the rest of this is that
reference

04:20:55.030 --> 04:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
reference
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:48.070 --> 04:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
even through page 116 we're
 
04:21:50.469 --> 04:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
doing primarily reference changes and
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
not sure we have do we have anything
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
substantive after that
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
with the change other than the reference
 
04:22:03.520 --> 04:22:03.990 align:start position:0%
with the change other than the reference
change

04:22:03.990 --> 04:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:22:07.590 --> 04:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
to department of energy uh on page 118
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
and into the beginning of 119
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
um is the contracting authority
 
04:22:17.189 --> 04:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
reducing it to the level set by governor
 
04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
and council oh the ten
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
and again i think this is institute more
 
04:22:27.120 --> 04:22:27.429 align:start position:0%
and again i think this is institute more
uh

04:22:27.429 --> 04:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
standard procedure for this new entity
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
that every other agency and state
 
04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.840 --> 04:22:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
through

04:22:58.830 --> 04:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:58.840 --> 04:23:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:23:12.830 --> 04:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:12.840 --> 04:23:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
this

04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:20.630 --> 04:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
yeah this goes away this this is exactly
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
what we had in dread only
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
we were splitting into two different
 
04:23:26.309 --> 04:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
agencies so you had to figure out which
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
agency went to one
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
which one went to the other one and we
 
04:23:32.550 --> 04:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
had page after page after page of this
 
04:23:33.830 --> 04:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
reference change like you're saying
 
04:23:36.149 --> 04:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
where it says now department of energy
 
04:23:37.990 --> 04:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
that goes into state law and that
 
04:23:42.229 --> 04:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
disappears and never comes back
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
represent walls your hand is up yeah i
 
04:23:45.269 --> 04:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
went back
 
04:23:47.269 --> 04:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
and i figured out what my concern was
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
and so if we can go back to page 99
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
if you go to page 99 and look at 9
 
04:24:00.309 --> 04:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
7. line 7 says the chair of the
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
commission shall have the powers and
 
04:24:05.429 --> 04:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
duty set forth in rsa 21 g9
 
04:24:08.950 --> 04:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
21 g9 is what says that the commissioner
 
04:24:10.790 --> 04:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
should report directly to the governor
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
so by incorporating that reference
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's where that comes from and that's
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
where my concern came from
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
and that's why it took me a few minutes
 
04:24:19.189 --> 04:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
was to go back and figure out exactly
 
04:24:20.630 --> 04:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
what it was is that
 
04:24:21.910 --> 04:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
i knew there was an issue but to go
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
figure it out took a couple of minutes
 
04:24:25.510 --> 04:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
but that's the reference that becomes
 
04:24:25.520 --> 04:24:31.590 align:start position:0%
but that's the reference that becomes
problematic

04:24:31.590 --> 04:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:33.910 --> 04:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
let me respond after this hearing just
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
to go through
 
04:24:38.309 --> 04:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
21 g9 and determine if this is something
 
04:24:40.630 --> 04:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
that only should apply to the department
 
04:24:43.750 --> 04:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
agency head as opposed to the uh chair
 
04:24:45.510 --> 04:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the commission but i'll report back
 
04:24:47.189 --> 04:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
to you on that representative walls
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's lovely you're coming back on
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
tuesday yes
 
04:24:57.730 --> 04:24:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:57.740 --> 04:25:01.189 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:03.030 --> 04:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay man i'm trying to get through to
 
04:25:06.149 --> 04:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
the end of the hb2 sections
 
04:25:08.110 --> 04:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
to see if we have anything else
 
04:25:08.120 --> 04:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
to see if we have anything else
substantive

04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
substantive
 
04:25:14.550 --> 04:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm on page 134 and i still don't
 
04:25:17.590 --> 04:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
see much
 
04:25:19.269 --> 04:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
the one concern that has been raised by
 
04:25:21.910 --> 04:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders is in page 136
 
04:25:25.349 --> 04:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
relative to utility restructuring
 
04:25:28.149 --> 04:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
um that is something this section
 
04:25:28.159 --> 04:25:29.189 align:start position:0%
um that is something this section
becomes

04:25:29.189 --> 04:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
04:25:31.269 --> 04:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
an acronis to the current state of
 
04:25:33.269 --> 04:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
affairs because
 
04:25:36.070 --> 04:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
utility restructuring has happened so
 
04:25:37.910 --> 04:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
directing this new department to start a
 
04:25:37.920 --> 04:25:38.550 align:start position:0%
directing this new department to start a
proceeding

04:25:38.550 --> 04:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
which again is existing language um
 
04:25:44.790 --> 04:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
this doesn't make a ton of sense so
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
again this is a product of casting a
 
04:25:47.510 --> 04:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
wide net
 
04:25:49.349 --> 04:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
copying everything out of one part of
 
04:25:51.830 --> 04:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
the law into a new part of the law
 
04:25:55.750 --> 04:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
but we would not intend to begin a new
 
04:25:59.510 --> 04:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
restructuring utility restructuring
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:19.349 --> 04:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
people are zooming in this is like
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
watching paint dry because we're
 
04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:27.750 --> 04:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
our zoom audience is bigger than it's
 
04:26:29.429 --> 04:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
been so they must like watching paint
 
04:26:29.439 --> 04:26:32.469 align:start position:0%
been so they must like watching paint
drawing

04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
are we gonna hold three people
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
chairwoman no we have 16.
 
04:26:36.479 --> 04:26:42.070 align:start position:0%
chairwoman no we have 16.
wow

04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
so just one further representation
 
04:26:48.149 --> 04:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
so matt i assume when you say
 
04:26:49.990 --> 04:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders i hope you're talking to
 
04:26:52.389 --> 04:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
chairman bose of science and technology
 
04:26:52.399 --> 04:26:53.189 align:start position:0%
chairman bose of science and technology
and

04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
getting his comments and suggestions he
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
was asked to look at this just so you
 
04:26:57.600 --> 04:26:58.149 align:start position:0%
was asked to look at this just so you
know

04:26:58.149 --> 04:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
and we've had conversations with him
 
04:27:02.550 --> 04:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
we've had conversations
 
04:27:04.950 --> 04:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
um you know with outside stakeholders as
 
04:27:04.960 --> 04:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
um you know with outside stakeholders as
well

04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
um whether it be you know regional
 
04:27:10.870 --> 04:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
groups that deal with energy issues
 
04:27:10.880 --> 04:27:12.229 align:start position:0%
groups that deal with energy issues
utilities

04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer advocate
 
04:27:17.110 --> 04:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
to wanting to make sure that a we get
 
04:27:19.750 --> 04:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
this right and it is workable
 
04:27:21.910 --> 04:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
directionally there's a lot of broad
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support for this idea
 
04:27:26.309 --> 04:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
chairman backus of course someone that
 
04:27:27.990 --> 04:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
spearheaded this idea
 
04:27:31.269 --> 04:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
while he was still in the legislature um
 
04:27:32.870 --> 04:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
and again we we see there are three
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
fundamental policy principles that i've
 
04:27:36.070 --> 04:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
identified previously i won't go back
 
04:27:37.110 --> 04:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
over them
 
04:27:39.110 --> 04:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
but this is something that a lot of
 
04:27:40.710 --> 04:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
people have been talking about
 
04:27:43.189 --> 04:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
and we're excited to now have a vehicle
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:48.550 --> 04:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
michael bells was asked two weeks ago to
 
04:27:50.469 --> 04:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
look at this he's not had
 
04:28:01.349 --> 04:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
another area is on page 149 the
 
04:28:05.590 --> 04:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
multi-use energy data platform
 
04:28:08.389 --> 04:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
this is something that is ongoing our
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
intention would not
 
04:28:12.790 --> 04:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
be to require that process to restart as
 
04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:28.309 --> 04:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
and i think the concern specifically is
 
04:28:31.269 --> 04:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
on page 150 lines 9 and 10 to initiate a
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
rule making
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to open a docket and that's
 
04:28:36.630 --> 04:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
just a tren
 
04:28:39.990 --> 04:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
again an anachronous uh scenario of
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
where current law says and what the
 
04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
process has been
 
04:28:45.910 --> 04:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
um well again just want to make sure
 
04:28:47.429 --> 04:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
that there's a seamless transition there
 
04:28:49.590 --> 04:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
so they've been making rules and not
 
04:28:49.600 --> 04:28:49.990 align:start position:0%
so they've been making rules and not
opening

04:28:49.990 --> 04:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
opening
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
dockets they've there's currently an
 
04:28:53.830 --> 04:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
adjudicated proceeding
 
04:28:56.790 --> 04:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
that's open at the commission we would
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
want that to continue to be
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
the venue for conversation okay so that
 
04:29:09.750 --> 04:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:13.269 --> 04:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes mr hatch
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
i made to that end um when you say
 
04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
you're starting your rulemaking process
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
exactly what do you mean by that are
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
they having
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
notified public hearings or is it
 
04:29:24.239 --> 04:29:25.110 align:start position:0%
notified public hearings or is it
informal

04:29:25.110 --> 04:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
informal
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
to what extent are they doing that and
 
04:29:26.880 --> 04:29:28.630 align:start position:0%
to what extent are they doing that and
that's

04:29:28.630 --> 04:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:29:32.870 --> 04:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
quite important i would defer to
 
04:29:35.830 --> 04:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
um either the parties to that docket or
 
04:29:35.840 --> 04:29:36.309 align:start position:0%
um either the parties to that docket or
the

04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
puc to the extent they can speak about
 
04:29:40.469 --> 04:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
an ongoing proceeding
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with the granular
 
04:29:44.469 --> 04:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
details of where that proceeding is
 
04:29:47.189 --> 04:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
so this is not changing any of the rules
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
or procedures
 
04:29:51.830 --> 04:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
of the established puc is that what
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's that was my point that one that's
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
what i was trying to fish out
 
04:29:58.149 --> 04:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
yeah okay i think we have a wrong term
 
04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's fine thank you that's okay
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
i think we got it worked out mr hatch
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you that is the end of
 
04:30:10.070 --> 04:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
the hb2 sections
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
the minute getting hot chairwoman i know
 
04:30:18.890 --> 04:30:18.900 align:start position:0%
you want to make kristen in for a while
 
04:30:18.900 --> 04:30:20.630 align:start position:0%
you want to make kristen in for a while
[Laughter]

04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:30:24.469 --> 04:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
i want to turn to page 16 in the budget
 
04:30:27.910 --> 04:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
this is the hb1 yeah yeah this is the
 
04:30:29.590 --> 04:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
office of the governor and i didn't
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
actually after i looked through here
 
04:30:33.750 --> 04:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
we have already approved the governor's
 
04:30:35.110 --> 04:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
council on disability
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh chuck sayo came out and did a great
 
04:30:37.279 --> 04:30:38.550 align:start position:0%
uh chuck sayo came out and did a great
job

04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
job
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page 16. you have the
 
04:30:42.870 --> 04:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
office of the governor
 
04:30:45.670 --> 04:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
and one can see that general fund usage
 
04:30:48.070 --> 04:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
has gone down and then if you turn
 
04:30:51.189 --> 04:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
to page 15
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
you also have general funds and you can
 
04:30:54.870 --> 04:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
see the governor was
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much as harsh on himself as he
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
was other agencies general funds go down
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
in 23 we have the issue of the
 
04:31:05.349 --> 04:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
extra pay period so we've seen general
 
04:31:07.349 --> 04:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
fund usage go up there
 
04:31:10.630 --> 04:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
but i really didn't see anything unusual
 
04:31:10.640 --> 04:31:11.030 align:start position:0%
but i really didn't see anything unusual
or

04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:31:15.510 --> 04:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
added in the executive branch
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
budget whatsoever and as i said we went
 
04:31:17.840 --> 04:31:18.630 align:start position:0%
budget whatsoever and as i said we went
through

04:31:18.630 --> 04:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
the gcd and we approved that budget
 
04:31:21.359 --> 04:31:23.030 align:start position:0%
the gcd and we approved that budget
previously

04:31:23.030 --> 04:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
previously
 
04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
but am i correct that you just basically
 
04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
are flat funded
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
yes we applied that same starting point
 
04:31:29.680 --> 04:31:30.070 align:start position:0%
yes we applied that same starting point
for

04:31:30.070 --> 04:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:31:32.070 --> 04:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
our office the same way we did for every
 
04:31:34.469 --> 04:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
other department in state government
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
and i'll also use this opportunity on
 
04:31:37.990 --> 04:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
page 16 to look at the total
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
number of positions that exist in the
 
04:31:41.189 --> 04:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
04:31:44.309 --> 04:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
according to the budget book is one
 
04:31:47.189 --> 04:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
um of course and this speaks to why osi
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
is unique as well
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
there are more than there's more than
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
one position in the guys oh obviously
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
you guys are here and you're in there i
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
mean we see that all the time sometimes
 
04:31:56.550 --> 04:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
you forget it
 
04:31:58.630 --> 04:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
it shows up more when you're doing
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
something like you are with the
 
04:32:01.269 --> 04:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
04:32:03.269 --> 04:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
and because we don't think about it a
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
whole lot i mean
 
04:32:06.389 --> 04:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
dj's there the two of you are there i
 
04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't know who else is there but there's
 
04:32:08.710 --> 04:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
a whole
 
04:32:10.870 --> 04:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
plethora of staff sitting there not just
 
04:32:12.309 --> 04:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
one person yes
 
04:32:15.030 --> 04:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
but we didn't reorganize you yes i will
 
04:32:16.070 --> 04:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
say dj is now
 
04:32:20.309 --> 04:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh at the end of the day he's moved yes
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes he has okay
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
insurance yes
 
04:32:29.349 --> 04:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
um representative walsh you have your
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
hand up i
 
04:32:34.469 --> 04:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
do um so i'm going through this
 
04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
and it appears that they're including in
 
04:32:38.630 --> 04:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
here a section that has been
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
repealed in law um
 
04:32:44.149 --> 04:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
so i think let me make sure i've got the
 
04:32:46.830 --> 04:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
page right
 
04:32:51.269 --> 04:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
um yeah if you go to page 126.
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
age 126 is this hb2
 
04:32:57.189 --> 04:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
this is hb2 i believe she's looking at
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
it is correct
 
04:32:59.910 --> 04:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
and you go to the bottom of the page
 
04:33:03.269 --> 04:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
where it starts with 374.22
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
what line is that 33. 33
 
04:33:08.949 --> 04:33:08.959 align:start position:0%
we're looking there and the subsequent
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
sections in there
 
04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
i think that may have been repealed in
 
04:33:11.600 --> 04:33:13.750 align:start position:0%
i think that may have been repealed in
2012.

04:33:13.750 --> 04:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
2012.
 
04:33:17.830 --> 04:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
um so i think that deserves some
 
04:33:20.230 --> 04:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
looking at i'm sorry i'm just catching
 
04:33:22.390 --> 04:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
up here page 126.
 
04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879 align:start position:0%
page 126 matt uh in hb2
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
well in case you haven't gathered matt
 
04:33:38.070 --> 04:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
we're not taking any action on this this
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
afternoon because
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
you're coming back with lots of
 
04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
questions so yes
 
04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh line 33 shared we're looking at
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
that section has been repealed and she
 
04:33:49.990 --> 04:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
would like you to look at it
 
04:33:54.869 --> 04:33:54.879 align:start position:0%
and that goes through page 127
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
line 27 page 127 line 20
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
line 16. so it goes it starts on 126
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
reporting back on tuesday yes
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
okay so to be clear as i say it wasn't
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
all repealed but most of it was and i
 
04:34:23.279 --> 04:34:23.670 align:start position:0%
all repealed but most of it was and i
think

04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
but parts that are included in here are
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
part of the parts that were repealed
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
so i think it deserves a really careful
 
04:34:30.869 --> 04:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
look because
 
04:34:32.789 --> 04:34:32.799 align:start position:0%
it seems silly to be including repealed
 
04:34:35.109 --> 04:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
laws in this
 
04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
and i will i'll compare that to the
 
04:34:39.269 --> 04:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
and see what was the the root cause of
 
04:34:43.990 --> 04:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
and representative walls was is this a
 
04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
potential situation where chapter law
 
04:34:50.150 --> 04:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
might say one thing
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
or do you feel that the language in the
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
rsa as it exists today
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
lba might be able to help you with that
 
04:34:58.470 --> 04:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
matt that would be where i would go to
 
04:34:58.480 --> 04:34:59.029 align:start position:0%
matt that would be where i would go to
essex

04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
essex
 
04:35:00.869 --> 04:35:00.879 align:start position:0%
i'm just i guess my concern is i don't
 
04:35:02.310 --> 04:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
know where we would have found repealed
 
04:35:04.709 --> 04:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
language to include
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make sure we can track
 
04:35:07.910 --> 04:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
that micro nancy do you happen to know
 
04:35:09.609 --> 04:35:09.619 align:start position:0%
off the top of your head
 
04:35:09.619 --> 04:35:10.949 align:start position:0%
off the top of your head
[Music]

04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm actually looking at it online and
 
04:35:14.310 --> 04:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
see repealed language here
 
04:35:23.189 --> 04:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
look at 374 colon a hyphen one it's 374
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
colon 22 dash l
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
yeah she's telling you
 
04:35:31.750 --> 04:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
i think she's telling you it's a
 
04:35:33.269 --> 04:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
different statue is that what the
 
04:35:35.189 --> 04:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
translation was nancy
 
04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
yes if uh if i could well let's just
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
let's look at this because to me it's
 
04:35:41.830 --> 04:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
confusing here what's going on so i just
 
04:35:44.949 --> 04:35:44.959 align:start position:0%
i just think that warren's looking at
 
04:35:48.551 --> 04:35:48.561 align:start position:0%
can you see my screen no
 
04:36:00.070 --> 04:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.070 --> 04:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's still effective
 
04:36:05.670 --> 04:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
some reference you're looking at that
 
04:36:09.670 --> 04:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:12.869 --> 04:36:12.879 align:start position:0%
um you know nancy let me get back to you
 
04:36:14.551 --> 04:36:14.561 align:start position:0%
later on this because i'm crossing it's
 
04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
just hard to do this all at once on the
 
04:36:16.480 --> 04:36:17.429 align:start position:0%
just hard to do this all at once on the
screen

04:36:17.429 --> 04:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
screen
 
04:36:20.470 --> 04:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
mary beth we need to have some answer
 
04:36:20.480 --> 04:36:20.869 align:start position:0%
mary beth we need to have some answer
for

04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
matt and chris who are going away with a
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff if this has not been
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
repealed nancy can you put that up one
 
04:36:28.949 --> 04:36:28.959 align:start position:0%
more time
 
04:36:30.949 --> 04:36:30.959 align:start position:0%
that they need to i mean they've got a
 
04:36:31.990 --> 04:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
lot of things they're doing
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
for us time is a finite resource well
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
here i would just say look at 374
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that this is a repeal
 
04:37:23.349 --> 04:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
either rather than just an exception
 
04:37:26.551 --> 04:37:26.561 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
04:37:28.150 --> 04:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
the problem i've got written in my notes
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
is 374 colon one
 
04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
hyphen a we have that up on the screen
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
um maybe there's something in here
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
it's the hyphen nance is it um
 
04:37:53.109 --> 04:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so it would be this one that's the
 
04:37:55.990 --> 04:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
first one you brought up nancy
 
04:37:59.830 --> 04:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
374 colon 1-a okay
 
04:38:06.949 --> 04:38:06.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
well we can uh go back and take a look
 
04:38:09.039 --> 04:38:11.429 align:start position:0%
well we can uh go back and take a look
and

04:38:11.429 --> 04:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay this was the
 
04:38:16.470 --> 04:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is the statute in question right
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:22.390 --> 04:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
i think it may make some stuff
 
04:38:24.310 --> 04:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
inapplicable but again it's just hard to
 
04:38:39.429 --> 04:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
do this on the fly
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay gentlemen i appreciate your time
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%

um if at all possible
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%

04:39:19.990 --> 04:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
amendment for us to
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%

i don't know that there's all that much
 
04:39:44.310 --> 04:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
drafting that would need to happen for

this amendment which does make me feel
 
04:39:47.110 --> 04:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
that it's a reasonable
 
04:39:50.230 --> 04:39:50.240 align:start position:0%

thank you so much uh representative so

04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
overview and then
 
04:42:31.990 --> 04:42:32.000 align:start position:0%

some
 
04:42:34.230 --> 04:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
amendments we're putting in and then we
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
can take questions so the department
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
receives no
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
state general funds and the majority of
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
its non-matching federal funds comes
 
04:42:43.670 --> 04:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
from the u.s department of labor
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
the biennial budget projection is based
 
04:42:47.990 --> 04:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
on knowledge and expectation of the
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
continuation of our core programs
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%

04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
insurance and labor market information
 
04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
the department also receives
 
04:42:58.230 --> 04:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
supplemental funding in the form of
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%

employees

04:43:01.510 --> 04:43:01.520 align:start position:0%

04:43:04.788 --> 04:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
difficult time hearing you i i don't
 
04:43:05.670 --> 04:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
know if you've got a
 
04:43:08.470 --> 04:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
mask on or uh you're not close up to the
 
04:43:11.350 --> 04:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
mic but we can barely hear you
 
04:43:14.550 --> 04:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
okay how's this better that's better
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sorry about that
 
04:43:20.150 --> 04:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh the department also received
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
supplemental funding in the form of a
 
04:43:21.920 --> 04:43:23.270 align:start position:0%
supplemental funding in the form of a
0.2

04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
0.2
 
04:43:25.430 --> 04:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
diversion of employer state unemployment
 
04:43:27.270 --> 04:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
taxes for administrative support in
 
04:43:27.280 --> 04:43:27.990 align:start position:0%
taxes for administrative support in
order

04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
order
 
04:43:30.550 --> 04:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
to cover federal funding shortfalls in
 
04:43:31.510 --> 04:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
and from the
 
04:43:34.390 --> 04:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
which the six million dollar annually is
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
deposited into the job training fund
 
04:43:39.190 --> 04:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
the department offers a variety of
 
04:43:41.350 --> 04:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
services to claimants job seekers and
 
04:43:43.110 --> 04:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
employers and 12
 
04:43:45.510 --> 04:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
full-service offices and two itinerary
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
offices located throughout the state
 
04:43:50.070 --> 04:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
therefore personnel services and benefit
 
04:43:51.910 --> 04:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
costs comprise the largest portion of
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
our overall budget
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
while services are currently provided
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
virtually we're confident we'll be able
 
04:44:00.070 --> 04:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
to open our offices back in
 
04:44:03.510 --> 04:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
to the public in 2021.
 
04:44:05.430 --> 04:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
personnel related costs comprise
 
04:44:07.110 --> 04:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 57
 
04:44:09.590 --> 04:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
of our budget when unemployment claims
 
04:44:11.190 --> 04:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
increases has been experienced
 
04:44:13.910 --> 04:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
resulting from the pandemic nhes
 
04:44:15.910 --> 04:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
receives additional federal funds based
 
04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
on workloads
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
in excess of our base budget workload
 
04:44:20.160 --> 04:44:21.910 align:start position:0%
in excess of our base budget workload
counts

04:44:21.910 --> 04:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
counts
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
a growing economy and low unemployment
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
rate like new hampshire was experiencing
 
04:44:28.390 --> 04:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic results in
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
decreased funding for
 
04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
employment security to put this into
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
context at the start of the fy
 
04:44:37.590 --> 04:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
1213 biennium the total number of staff
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
at the department was 453
 
04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
while at the start of the fy 2021
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
biennium the total
 
04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
number of staff was down to 249.
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic nhgs had the
 
04:44:51.510 --> 04:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
lowest staffing levels going back at
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
least 40 years
 
04:44:55.270 --> 04:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
considering how quickly the pandemic and
 
04:44:57.430 --> 04:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
related necessary public health
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%

workforce
 
04:45:01.990 --> 04:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
the department did not have time to hire
 
04:45:04.150 --> 04:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
additional staff in order to meet
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
the growing demand for unemployment

04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
amendments seeks to reverse this
 
04:50:48.550 --> 04:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
upside down dynamic first by eliminating
 
04:50:50.948 --> 04:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
the tax surcharges that drive up
 
04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
employer tax rates during times when
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
they can least afford it
 
04:50:56.070 --> 04:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
like during the great recession or
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
currently during the pandemic
 
04:50:59.910 --> 04:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
these surcharges are only needed because
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
the solvency controls allowing the trust
 
04:51:03.270 --> 04:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
fund to grow
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
to the predetermined point of solvency
 
04:51:06.628 --> 04:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
are set too low
 
04:51:08.948 --> 04:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
if the trust fund thresholds are
 
04:51:11.350 --> 04:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
increased then the surcharges that hit
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
employers during economic downturns and
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
no longer necessary
 
04:51:17.350 --> 04:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
second these amendments increase the
 
04:51:19.110 --> 04:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
second and third of the trust fund
 
04:51:21.990 --> 04:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
solvency thresholds ultimately allowing
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
the fund to grow to 400 million dollars
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
rather than the current limit of 300
 
04:51:29.110 --> 04:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars before employers receive
 
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
the maximum reduction to their
 
04:51:32.948 --> 04:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
unemployment tax rate
 
04:51:34.628 --> 04:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
we're confident that if these changes
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
had been implemented prior to the great
 
04:51:38.550 --> 04:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
recession new hampshire would have
 
04:51:40.628 --> 04:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
not needed to borrow the 120 million
 
04:51:42.070 --> 04:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
that we had borrowed from the federal
 
04:51:44.310 --> 04:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
treasury in order to pay benefits
 
04:51:46.550 --> 04:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
and if implemented prior to the pandemic
 
04:51:47.910 --> 04:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
we would have been able to avoid the
 
04:51:49.270 --> 04:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
trust fund needing
 
04:51:52.550 --> 04:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars from the cares flex
 
04:51:55.350 --> 04:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
act funds the first threshold would
 
04:51:56.390 --> 04:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
remain unchanged
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
providing tax relief when the fund grows
 
04:52:01.350 --> 04:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
to 250 million dollars
 
04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
the second threshold would be increased
 
04:52:05.110 --> 04:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
from 275 million
 
04:52:08.310 --> 04:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
to 350 million and the third threshold
 
04:52:10.550 --> 04:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
would be increased from 300 million
 
04:52:14.070 --> 04:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
to 400 million by setting these top
 
04:52:16.628 --> 04:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
top two thresholds at a higher trust
 
04:52:17.590 --> 04:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
fund balance
 
04:52:19.350 --> 04:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
then we eliminate the need to implement
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
surcharges when the trust fund falls
 
04:52:23.910 --> 04:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
because we will have allowed the fund to
 
04:52:25.430 --> 04:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
grow to a sufficient level
 
04:52:28.390 --> 04:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
to achieve solvency the second proposal
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
contained in house bill 2 involving the
 
04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
department is found in sections
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chairman and committee
 
04:53:58.708 --> 04:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
members so now the second section
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh section 69-74
 
04:54:04.868 --> 04:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
creating the granite state paid family
 
04:54:07.510 --> 04:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
leave plan
 
04:54:10.310 --> 04:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay the governor is going to come in
 
04:54:12.310 --> 04:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
and talk to us
 
04:54:14.390 --> 04:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
about that as well so we won't be voting
 
04:54:15.990 --> 04:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
on that today sir but please tell
 
04:54:18.788 --> 04:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
us about it okay the department
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
involvement in this proposal is with
 
04:54:22.470 --> 04:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
administering two
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
new revenue funds the first is the fm li
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
premium fund and the second is the fmli
 
04:54:29.040 --> 04:54:29.510 align:start position:0%
premium fund and the second is the fmli
premium

04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
premium
 
04:54:31.990 --> 04:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
stabilization trust fund in both
 
04:54:33.830 --> 04:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
instances the department would utilize
 
04:54:34.470 --> 04:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
the option
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
contained in the proposal to contract
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
with private sector benefit
 
04:54:40.470 --> 04:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
administrators in order to carry out
 
04:54:41.750 --> 04:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
these functions
 
04:54:43.190 --> 04:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
the reason why the department feels
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
contracting this out to be competitively
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
bid in
 
04:54:47.670 --> 04:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
the private insurance administrator
 
04:54:49.590 --> 04:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
market is that these types of services
 
04:54:51.510 --> 04:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
are currently available
 
04:54:53.350 --> 04:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
and carried out by private sector
 
04:54:55.110 --> 04:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
providers so it would make little sense
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
04:54:57.670 --> 04:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
to take the time which has been
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
estimated to be at least 24 months
 
04:55:02.550 --> 04:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
and invest the people and the money to
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
create the necessary i.t
 
04:55:05.750 --> 04:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to account for and
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
operate operationalize these funds
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
instead the department would utilize the
 
04:55:12.708 --> 04:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
language contained in this proposal to
 
04:55:14.230 --> 04:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
competitively procure
 
04:55:15.750 --> 04:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
these services from a private
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
third-party benefit administrator
 
04:55:20.310 --> 04:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
we would expect this process to take
 
04:55:22.628 --> 04:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
approximately six months from passage of
 
04:55:23.590 --> 04:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
the program
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
until entering into a contract with the
 
04:55:27.750 --> 04:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
chosen vendor
 
04:55:30.628 --> 04:55:30.638 align:start position:0%
and with that i close our remarks we'll
 
04:55:32.470 --> 04:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
obviously look forward to continue
 
04:55:34.150 --> 04:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
the great work that we're doing here at
 
04:55:35.670 --> 04:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
employment security
 
04:55:38.070 --> 04:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
with our employers job seekers and
 
04:55:40.628 --> 04:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
providing the assistance necessary
 
04:55:42.550 --> 04:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
to our citizens in order to get by
 
04:55:43.910 --> 04:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
during this
 
04:55:47.910 --> 04:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic situation that we've incurred
 
04:55:50.470 --> 04:55:50.480 align:start position:0%

04:56:43.990 --> 04:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
most of what you said but i i certainly
 
04:56:45.510 --> 04:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
didn't want to interrupt you and i don't
 
04:56:47.030 --> 04:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
need to hear it all again
 
04:56:48.708 --> 04:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
could you do that or is that not
 
04:56:50.550 --> 04:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
practical yeah um
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
actually deputy commissioner layers is
 
04:56:54.390 --> 04:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
on as well and he has been heavily
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
involved in that so i'll let him
 
04:56:58.150 --> 04:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
address that and maybe you'll hear him a
 
04:56:59.510 --> 04:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
little clearer than me
 
04:57:02.830 --> 04:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
and my scratchy voice well thank you
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner and i apologize for having
 
04:57:05.670 --> 04:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
04:57:08.550 --> 04:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
no no no no representatives good
 
04:57:10.310 --> 04:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon everyone this is rich lavers
 
04:57:10.320 --> 04:57:10.948 align:start position:0%
afternoon everyone this is rich lavers
so

04:57:10.948 --> 04:57:10.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:16.830 --> 04:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
oh i think i absent
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:29.110 --> 04:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
rich rich you're talking and it's my
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
fault that nobody can hear you
 
04:57:34.868 --> 04:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
oh i'm back you're back i apologize it's
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
late in the afternoon
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
all right uh well i'm glad to be back i
 
04:57:41.670 --> 04:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
got booted out of there for a second
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
04:57:44.150 --> 04:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was trying to promote you so
 
04:57:45.750 --> 04:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
we could see your picture as well and
 
04:57:49.350 --> 04:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
instead i disconnected you bingo
 
04:57:51.350 --> 04:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
all right so the the the paid family
 
04:57:53.670 --> 04:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
leave proposal that the the governor put
 
04:57:55.430 --> 04:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
forward in house bill 2
 
04:57:57.670 --> 04:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
the the involvement from employment
 
04:57:57.680 --> 04:57:58.550 align:start position:0%
the the involvement from employment
security

04:57:58.550 --> 04:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
security
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
is minimal compared to the role that the
 
04:58:03.750 --> 04:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
04:58:05.110 --> 04:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
will play
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
and admin services would his envision to
 
04:58:08.160 --> 04:58:08.788 align:start position:0%
and admin services would his envision to
oversee

04:58:08.788 --> 04:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
oversee
 
04:58:11.990 --> 04:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
the procurement of
 
04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
private sector insurance providers to to
 
04:58:16.788 --> 04:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
provide the benefit the state employees
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:58:19.670 --> 04:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
private and private companies could then
 
04:58:20.708 --> 04:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
opt in
 
04:58:22.310 --> 04:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
um and then provide the coverage to
 
04:58:23.510 --> 04:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
their employees and then there would
 
04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
also be a pooled risk program
 
04:58:28.070 --> 04:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
for those individual employees that are
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
at an employer that
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
elected not to participate in the
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
program so our role
 
04:58:36.470 --> 04:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
is secondary to admin services and our
 
04:58:38.070 --> 04:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
role would be in
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
administering the two revenue programs
 
04:58:44.788 --> 04:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
to new revenue funds that were created
 
04:58:47.030 --> 04:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
and so there's language contained in
 
04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
both of those sections that allows the
 
04:58:48.958 --> 04:58:49.830 align:start position:0%
both of those sections that allows the
department

04:58:49.830 --> 04:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:58:52.868 --> 04:58:52.878 align:start position:0%
to procure the administration of
 
04:58:56.628 --> 04:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
those funds to an outside provider
 
04:59:00.230 --> 04:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
we've been talking with many folks
 
04:59:01.990 --> 04:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
several years that we've been talking
 
04:59:06.788 --> 04:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
about paid family leave
 
04:59:09.750 --> 04:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
that type of service is already being
 
04:59:11.910 --> 04:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
administered in the private market
 
04:59:14.708 --> 04:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
with plans that are in place third-party
 
04:59:16.628 --> 04:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
benefit administrators are doing that
 
04:59:17.830 --> 04:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
type of work
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
and so the department felt that it made
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
little sense
 
04:59:25.750 --> 04:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
to spend the time money and to create a
 
04:59:27.830 --> 04:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
new unit within the department
 
04:59:30.230 --> 04:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
um when we could competitively procure
 
04:59:31.110 --> 04:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
that out
 
04:59:33.030 --> 04:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
and seek that from an existing
 
04:59:34.550 --> 04:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
administrator who probably
 
04:59:37.110 --> 04:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
oh not probably definitely already has
 
04:59:38.868 --> 04:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
the i.t programming
 
04:59:42.310 --> 04:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
already created obviously we have
 
04:59:44.788 --> 04:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to compare any proposals
 
04:59:45.510 --> 04:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we get
 
04:59:47.910 --> 04:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
against our projected costs of creating
 
04:59:49.750 --> 04:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
it in-house in the state
 
04:59:51.590 --> 04:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that going that
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
route would
 
04:59:56.070 --> 04:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
produce efficiencies not only in
 
04:59:57.910 --> 04:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
creating a new program but in dollars
 
04:59:57.920 --> 04:59:58.390 align:start position:0%
creating a new program but in dollars
spent

04:59:58.390 --> 04:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
spent
 
05:00:00.150 --> 05:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
so that would be something we would be
 
05:00:01.990 --> 05:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
reviewing and comparing against but that
 
05:00:03.190 --> 05:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
would be the goal
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
would be to competitively procure that
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
service from an existing
 
05:00:11.830 --> 05:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:13.830 --> 05:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative hatch you have follow-up
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
no that's that's fine thank you
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
i just couldn't hear the commissioner
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to uh understand what
 
05:00:20.470 --> 05:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
he said no that's okay
 
05:00:23.430 --> 05:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i disconnected mr lavers in
 
05:00:24.628 --> 05:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
the middle while i was trying to make
 
05:00:27.030 --> 05:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
his picture come up as well
 
05:00:29.990 --> 05:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you rich and madam chair one other
 
05:00:30.000 --> 05:00:30.868 align:start position:0%
thank you rich and madam chair one other
um

05:00:30.868 --> 05:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:34.628 --> 05:00:34.638 align:start position:0%
we had um uh submitted an amendment
 
05:00:37.110 --> 05:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh our proposal to be considered for
 
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
amending into house bill 2
 
05:00:42.070 --> 05:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
regarding the uh state being able to
 
05:00:42.080 --> 05:00:42.948 align:start position:0%
regarding the uh state being able to
participate

05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
participate
 
05:00:45.030 --> 05:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
in the integrity data hub and i know
 
05:00:46.230 --> 05:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's something that
 
05:00:48.868 --> 05:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
you had wanted to discuss as well yes
 
05:00:50.390 --> 05:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:00:52.708 --> 05:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
mike do i have that amendment back i
 
05:00:59.350 --> 05:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
i will look at my stack real quickly but
 
05:01:23.520 --> 05:01:23.530 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:23.530 --> 05:01:28.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:01:28.830 --> 05:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
747 747
 
05:01:34.470 --> 05:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
and if you could share your screen so
 
05:01:36.390 --> 05:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
the people at home can have it
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
i thought you had brought that up to me
 
05:01:46.550 --> 05:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:49.510 --> 05:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay it's up on the screen and rich
 
05:01:50.708 --> 05:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
those of us sitting in
 
05:01:53.510 --> 05:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
lob have a copy as well because mr
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
hoffman very efficiently provided it at
 
05:01:55.680 --> 05:01:56.550 align:start position:0%
hoffman very efficiently provided it at
lunch

05:01:56.550 --> 05:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
05:01:59.830 --> 05:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
so please talk about it all right so the
 
05:02:01.990 --> 05:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
the section that uh would be amended
 
05:02:02.000 --> 05:02:02.868 align:start position:0%
the section that uh would be amended
here

05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:02:06.628 --> 05:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
is 282 118 this is the the provision in
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
the unemployment compensation statute
 
05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
that deals with confidentiality of
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment comp information
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
so this language would allow
 
05:02:19.590 --> 05:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
the department to participate in what is
 
05:02:21.750 --> 05:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
called the integrity data hub
 
05:02:24.830 --> 05:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
the integrity data hub it's a nationally
 
05:02:27.670 --> 05:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
coordinated anti-fraud prevention
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
strategy it's particularly focused on
 
05:02:34.150 --> 05:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
id theft fraud which has been a major
 
05:02:34.160 --> 05:02:35.190 align:start position:0%
id theft fraud which has been a major
problem

05:02:35.190 --> 05:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:02:39.190 --> 05:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
for every state during the pandemic and
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
their unemployment
 
05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
programs have just been getting
 
05:02:43.110 --> 05:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
inundated with id
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
theft claims we've had about 20 000 of
 
05:02:47.830 --> 05:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
these in new hampshire
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
um and that the the goal is that these
 
05:02:52.868 --> 05:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
fraud schemes as their
 
05:02:56.708 --> 05:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
um targeted against one state
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we know that those are not isolated
 
05:02:59.920 --> 05:03:00.628 align:start position:0%
that we know that those are not isolated
incidents

05:03:00.628 --> 05:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
and that the experiences of one state
 
05:03:05.430 --> 05:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
and the successes that they have in
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
preventing this type of activity
 
05:03:09.830 --> 05:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
detecting it and then shutting it down
 
05:03:11.190 --> 05:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
that the best strategy
 
05:03:13.590 --> 05:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
is to share those experiences across all
 
05:03:13.600 --> 05:03:14.470 align:start position:0%
is to share those experiences across all
states

05:03:14.470 --> 05:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:03:17.670 --> 05:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
so that we have the the benefit of those
 
05:03:19.590 --> 05:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
other states that have been able to
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
deter this fraud we can prevent it here
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and
 
05:03:26.628 --> 05:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
protect our trust fund this would be
 
05:03:29.430 --> 05:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
administered by the national association
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
of state workforce
 
05:03:33.510 --> 05:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
agencies it's a trade group that every
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
state workforce agency belongs
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
it is being implemented in partnership
 
05:03:42.310 --> 05:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
and now in naswa the national
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
association of state workforce agencies
 
05:03:46.868 --> 05:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
is the agent of the u.s department of
 
05:03:46.878 --> 05:03:47.670 align:start position:0%
is the agent of the u.s department of
labor

05:03:47.670 --> 05:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
labor
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
so it is very much being promoted
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
and overseen by the federal government
 
05:03:58.390 --> 05:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
we would retain ownership of our
 
05:04:00.788 --> 05:04:00.798 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation information so
 
05:04:02.550 --> 05:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
our benefit information that would be
 
05:04:03.990 --> 05:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
provided we would retain
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
ownership of that other states are not
 
05:04:07.990 --> 05:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to search
 
05:04:11.270 --> 05:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
our data it's only done by uh
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
the naswa who's overseeing this in their
 
05:04:15.510 --> 05:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
integrity team
 
05:04:18.390 --> 05:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
who would search our claims data to
 
05:04:18.400 --> 05:04:19.030 align:start position:0%
who would search our claims data to
detect

05:04:19.030 --> 05:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
detect
 
05:04:21.350 --> 05:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
fraud schemes that they have found in
 
05:04:22.150 --> 05:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
other states
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
they would then alert us to these
 
05:04:26.470 --> 05:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
schemes and then allow us to shut down
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
those claims
 
05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
we would be able to terminate the gr the
 
05:04:31.600 --> 05:04:32.470 align:start position:0%
we would be able to terminate the gr the
agreement

05:04:32.470 --> 05:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
05:04:36.150 --> 05:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
with 30 days notice and all
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
but three states at this point
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
have indicated their likelihood
 
05:04:46.310 --> 05:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
of participating and we feel that
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
the language here provides sufficient
 
05:04:49.200 --> 05:04:50.550 align:start position:0%
the language here provides sufficient
controls

05:04:50.550 --> 05:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
controls
 
05:04:52.868 --> 05:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
so that if the department were
 
05:04:52.878 --> 05:04:54.150 align:start position:0%
so that if the department were
uncomfortable

05:04:54.150 --> 05:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
felt that this program was not being
 
05:04:58.708 --> 05:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
properly administered
 
05:05:02.070 --> 05:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
or put the state's information at risk
 
05:05:03.750 --> 05:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
we would be able to terminate that
 
05:05:05.510 --> 05:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
agreement immediately
 
05:05:08.788 --> 05:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
but with the the amount of
 
05:05:12.310 --> 05:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
id theft that is taking place
 
05:05:15.110 --> 05:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do this on our own and trying
 
05:05:16.150 --> 05:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
to stay ahead
 
05:05:18.110 --> 05:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
of what is a very coordinated
 
05:05:18.120 --> 05:05:19.990 align:start position:0%
of what is a very coordinated
sophisticated

05:05:19.990 --> 05:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
sophisticated
 
05:05:22.868 --> 05:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
multinational attack against the
 
05:05:24.788 --> 05:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation systems
 
05:05:27.910 --> 05:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
of this country we can't continue to do
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
this by ourself
 
05:05:31.590 --> 05:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
we want to be proactive we want to stay
 
05:05:33.510 --> 05:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
ahead of the fraud instead of reacting
 
05:05:34.230 --> 05:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
to it
 
05:05:36.310 --> 05:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
and we think this is the best course of
 
05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
action for
 
05:05:40.550 --> 05:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and going forward and with
 
05:05:40.560 --> 05:05:41.110 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and going forward and with
that

05:05:41.110 --> 05:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:05:43.110 --> 05:05:43.120 align:start position:0%

sorry my mistake okay it doesn't look
 
05:05:54.958 --> 05:05:55.350 align:start position:0%
sorry my mistake okay it doesn't look
like

05:05:55.350 --> 05:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:05:57.910 --> 05:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
we have any questions represent walls
 
05:05:59.990 --> 05:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
has raised her hand represent walls
 
05:06:01.990 --> 05:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
i do i have a couple of questions one is
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
there any charge to the state does it
 
05:06:05.510 --> 05:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
cost the state anything to participate
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:06:09.910 --> 05:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
there's no cost to the states we uh new
 
05:06:11.510 --> 05:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire along with all of the other
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
states and territories
 
05:06:15.830 --> 05:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
we are dues paying members in the
 
05:06:17.750 --> 05:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
national association of state workforce
 
05:06:17.760 --> 05:06:18.708 align:start position:0%
national association of state workforce
agencies

05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
05:06:22.230 --> 05:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
um the the cost of creating the data hub
 
05:06:23.110 --> 05:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
are being
 
05:06:26.230 --> 05:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
paid for by those dues together with u.s
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
department of labor so right now there's
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
no additional cost for states to
 
05:06:29.600 --> 05:06:30.788 align:start position:0%
no additional cost for states to
participate

05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
participate
 
05:06:32.310 --> 05:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and i just want to clarify you
 
05:06:34.150 --> 05:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
said that the state has 20
 
05:06:36.628 --> 05:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
000 cases of id theft that in the last
 
05:06:36.638 --> 05:06:37.350 align:start position:0%
000 cases of id theft that in the last
year

05:06:37.350 --> 05:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:06:39.270 --> 05:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's a frightening and very large
 
05:06:40.788 --> 05:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
number i just wanted to confirm i heard
 
05:06:42.310 --> 05:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
it correctly
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
um it's an incredibly scary number um
 
05:06:44.878 --> 05:06:45.750 align:start position:0%
um it's an incredibly scary number um
representative

05:06:45.750 --> 05:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:06:49.750 --> 05:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
we've had uh 20 000 of these cases and
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
the men and women that we have here that
 
05:06:53.590 --> 05:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
are responsible for
 
05:06:56.470 --> 05:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
literally reviewing every single new
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
claim as it gets filed to make sure that
 
05:06:59.510 --> 05:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
05:07:02.230 --> 05:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
a fraudulent claim they deserve all of
 
05:07:02.868 --> 05:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
the credit
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
for the fact that new hampshire has
 
05:07:06.070 --> 05:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
prevented payment in over
 
05:07:09.990 --> 05:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
99 of these id theft cases
 
05:07:12.150 --> 05:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
you know the credit doesn't go uh to me
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go to leadership it goes to
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
these folks that have just been doing
 
05:07:18.390 --> 05:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
incredible work day in and day out
 
05:07:20.788 --> 05:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
but we know it's not sustainable um what
 
05:07:21.990 --> 05:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
they're currently doing
 
05:07:23.990 --> 05:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we need to have a better strategy
 
05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
which involves
 
05:07:27.750 --> 05:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
um as like everything else um involves
 
05:07:27.760 --> 05:07:28.470 align:start position:0%
um as like everything else um involves
technology

05:07:28.470 --> 05:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
technology
 
05:07:30.150 --> 05:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
and and coordinating with other states
 
05:07:32.230 --> 05:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
so that's where idh really comes in and
 
05:07:35.030 --> 05:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
will benefit us
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%

here because i'm getting complaints
 
05:08:50.788 --> 05:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
about some of the appeals having to do
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
and some of the issues having to do with
 
05:08:54.550 --> 05:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
employment overcharges
 
05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
that had nothing to do with the
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
climates and there's been these huge
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
things and there's a couple of things
 
05:09:01.750 --> 05:09:01.760 align:start position:0%

05:09:04.320 --> 05:09:05.190 align:start position:0%
one as i'm seeing in my ncsl and other
notices

05:09:05.190 --> 05:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
notices
 
05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
that there are states like missouri that
 
05:09:08.788 --> 05:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
are introducing legislation to forgive
 
05:09:11.590 --> 05:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
the federal portion of that overpayment
 
05:09:13.030 --> 05:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what the status of
 
05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
that is here can we forgive the federal
 
05:09:16.788 --> 05:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
or the state portion when the claimant
 
05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's undue hardship on the claimant and
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
they have had no
 
05:09:21.030 --> 05:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own they
 
05:09:23.670 --> 05:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
receive the overpayment and secondly
 
05:09:25.510 --> 05:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
under federal law those appeals are
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to occur within
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay one question at a time
 
05:09:33.190 --> 05:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
not a book a load of questions all right
 
05:09:33.200 --> 05:09:33.750 align:start position:0%
not a book a load of questions all right
so

05:09:33.750 --> 05:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
the question seems to be other states
 
05:09:36.718 --> 05:09:37.030 align:start position:0%
the question seems to be other states
are

05:09:37.030 --> 05:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:09:39.670 --> 05:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
filing a bill has anybody filed a bill
 
05:09:40.470 --> 05:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
05:09:43.590 --> 05:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
here uh madam chair this is
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
rich slavers i'll take i'll take that
 
05:09:47.510 --> 05:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
first question right so the
 
05:09:51.190 --> 05:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
ability to forgive federal overpayments
 
05:09:54.390 --> 05:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
is governed by federal law
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
it's what they refer to as their equity
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
and good conscience standard
 
05:10:00.788 --> 05:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
test so a state must implement their
 
05:10:00.798 --> 05:10:01.350 align:start position:0%
test so a state must implement their
tests

05:10:01.350 --> 05:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
tests
 
05:10:04.310 --> 05:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
unless they've enacted their own law
 
05:10:06.070 --> 05:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
that is considered consistent and
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
compliant with the federal test
 
05:10:10.390 --> 05:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
seems unnecessary since we can just
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
simply borrow
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
and use the federal test new hampshire
 
05:10:15.510 --> 05:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
has already started to forgive some of
 
05:10:16.390 --> 05:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
those debts
 
05:10:18.390 --> 05:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
and what it requires is us to look at
 
05:10:19.430 --> 05:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
two things
 
05:10:21.430 --> 05:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
one we have to first determine whether
 
05:10:22.550 --> 05:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
the individual is
 
05:10:25.350 --> 05:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
at fault in creating the overpayment and
 
05:10:26.708 --> 05:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
if not at fault
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
then we look at whether or not repayment
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
would create a financial hardship
 
05:10:33.990 --> 05:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
so we've we implemented a process uh
 
05:10:36.150 --> 05:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
approximately two months ago for
 
05:10:37.670 --> 05:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
individuals to start
 
05:10:39.910 --> 05:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
applying for waivers if they had a
 
05:10:41.750 --> 05:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
federal overpayment
 
05:10:43.430 --> 05:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
all of that information is on our
 
05:10:46.628 --> 05:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
website we have received approximately 2
 
05:10:46.638 --> 05:10:47.110 align:start position:0%
website we have received approximately 2
000

05:10:47.110 --> 05:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
000
 
05:10:49.030 --> 05:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
requests from individuals to have their
 
05:10:50.788 --> 05:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
overpayment waived
 
05:10:53.190 --> 05:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
so we have been processing those
 
05:10:55.110 --> 05:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
initially we were waiting for
 
05:10:57.670 --> 05:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
guidance from u.s department of labor on
 
05:10:57.680 --> 05:10:58.788 align:start position:0%
guidance from u.s department of labor on
implementation

05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
05:11:01.830 --> 05:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
of that standard which we now have with
 
05:11:02.948 --> 05:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
regard to state
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
overpayments if it were in the state
 
05:11:06.550 --> 05:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
trust fund dollars
 
05:11:09.990 --> 05:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
a current state statute allows those to
 
05:11:10.000 --> 05:11:10.390 align:start position:0%
a current state statute allows those to
be

05:11:10.390 --> 05:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
forgiven and restitution not required if
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
the individual is not
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
at fault so similar to the federal
 
05:11:19.190 --> 05:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
standard so we have been doing that
 
05:11:20.470 --> 05:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
right along
 
05:11:22.390 --> 05:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
what we have found although the
 
05:11:24.628 --> 05:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
department does screw up occasionally we
 
05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
do make mistakes
 
05:11:28.310 --> 05:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
just like everybody else and there are
 
05:11:28.320 --> 05:11:29.510 align:start position:0%
just like everybody else and there are
occasions

05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
occasions
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
certainly with the volume that we've
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
seen and with all of these new programs
 
05:11:34.628 --> 05:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
that all have their own
 
05:11:37.510 --> 05:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
brand new eligibility criteria there are
 
05:11:37.520 --> 05:11:38.310 align:start position:0%
brand new eligibility criteria there are
times

05:11:38.310 --> 05:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
when uh an overpayment or improper
 
05:11:41.200 --> 05:11:42.150 align:start position:0%
when uh an overpayment or improper
payment

05:11:42.150 --> 05:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
payment
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
that results is the the fault of the
 
05:11:44.638 --> 05:11:45.510 align:start position:0%
that results is the the fault of the
department

05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:11:48.070 --> 05:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
those individuals will all be forgiven
 
05:11:50.150 --> 05:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
and not be required to be repaid
 
05:11:52.470 --> 05:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
however a lot of the overpayments that
 
05:11:53.750 --> 05:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
we are dealing with
 
05:11:56.310 --> 05:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
are don't fit into that bucket a lot of
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
these are with individuals
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
particularly self-employed or those that
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have their wages previously
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
reported to the department
 
05:12:06.628 --> 05:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
overstated their earnings and they did
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
that in
 
05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
an effort to increase their weekly
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
benefit amount
 
05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
and they self-attested to those
 
05:12:14.230 --> 05:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
overstated earnings
 
05:12:16.628 --> 05:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
and then when they provided their their
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
federal finance
 
05:12:20.470 --> 05:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
federal income tax records that are
 
05:12:22.550 --> 05:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
required to substantiate their ben
 
05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
their benefit amount those earnings were
 
05:12:26.070 --> 05:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
much lower
 
05:12:27.990 --> 05:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
those people have since been found
 
05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
overpaid they will be
 
05:12:31.750 --> 05:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
at fault they will be required to repay
 
05:12:33.750 --> 05:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
those i know they're not happy about
 
05:12:33.760 --> 05:12:34.390 align:start position:0%
those i know they're not happy about
that

05:12:34.390 --> 05:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:12:37.110 --> 05:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
but in those instances it's clearly the
 
05:12:39.030 --> 05:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
fault of the individual
 
05:12:41.270 --> 05:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
we also have other situations where
 
05:12:41.280 --> 05:12:42.070 align:start position:0%
we also have other situations where
individuals

05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
this and this happens a lot more than
 
05:12:45.430 --> 05:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
one would expect
 
05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
individuals that applied for benefits at
 
05:12:49.430 --> 05:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
the outset of the pandemic
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
who had actually uh quit employment for
 
05:12:53.750 --> 05:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
personal reasons
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic a lot of people
 
05:12:57.990 --> 05:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
who had left employment
 
05:13:00.788 --> 05:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
in the fourth quarter of 2019 or in
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
january and february of 2020
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
who then file for benefits tell us that
 
05:13:08.070 --> 05:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
they left employment for a coronavirus
 
05:13:09.190 --> 05:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
related reason
 
05:13:11.830 --> 05:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
we pay them benefits we then later learn
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
from their employer
 
05:13:15.430 --> 05:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
no no no they had left employment back
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
in january
 
05:13:19.590 --> 05:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
to for personal reasons those people are
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
found overpaid
 
05:13:22.470 --> 05:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
those people should not be forgiven
 
05:13:24.230 --> 05:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
either because they misrepresented the
 
05:13:25.830 --> 05:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances of their
 
05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
their separation and were not eligible
 
05:13:28.948 --> 05:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
for benefits
 
05:13:31.590 --> 05:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
so we have to parse through those issues
 
05:13:33.030 --> 05:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
we have to determine whether or not
 
05:13:33.670 --> 05:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
someone is
 
05:13:36.150 --> 05:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
at fault uh we try to do that as
 
05:13:36.160 --> 05:13:37.510 align:start position:0%
at fault uh we try to do that as
expeditiously

05:13:37.510 --> 05:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
expeditiously
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
as possible for those that are appealing
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
those determinations
 
05:13:45.030 --> 05:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
we have hired two additional rounds of
 
05:13:47.350 --> 05:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
appeal tribunal chairpersons
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
um with uh three people in the in the
 
05:13:53.030 --> 05:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the prior round uh three people
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
starting tomorrow
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
to increase our ability to process those
 
05:13:59.510 --> 05:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
appeals as quickly as possible
 
05:14:02.150 --> 05:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
we also will be issuing an rfp out to
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
private sector law firms
 
05:14:07.750 --> 05:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
and uh allowing them uh to conduct some
 
05:14:09.270 --> 05:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
of these hearings so that we can
 
05:14:11.110 --> 05:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
expedite those appeals
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
as well um so it it's the appeals are
 
05:14:16.948 --> 05:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
our difficult subject in order to handle
 
05:14:16.958 --> 05:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
our difficult subject in order to handle
quickly

05:14:17.590 --> 05:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
i think we're doing our best with
 
05:14:20.628 --> 05:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
increasing our own staffing
 
05:14:23.910 --> 05:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
but also leverage leveraging outside
 
05:14:25.350 --> 05:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
private sector
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
attorneys that have experience in
 
05:14:28.628 --> 05:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
employment law
 
05:14:31.190 --> 05:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
follow up represent walls indeed so a
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
couple of things first of all i want to
 
05:14:32.638 --> 05:14:33.270 align:start position:0%
couple of things first of all i want to
say

05:14:33.270 --> 05:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:14:35.830 --> 05:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
i think you have done a yeoman's job and
 
05:14:36.628 --> 05:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
i don't want you
 
05:14:37.910 --> 05:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
because this is any way a personal
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
attack on you uh commissioners
 
05:14:42.550 --> 05:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
i'm so awed by what you've done having
 
05:14:43.510 --> 05:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
said that
 
05:14:46.310 --> 05:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing from constituents that it's
 
05:14:46.948 --> 05:14:46.958 align:start position:0%
that they
 
05:14:49.350 --> 05:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
on the appeals that it's taking six
 
05:14:51.510 --> 05:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
months for an appeal to be scheduled
 
05:14:53.830 --> 05:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
yet the federal requirement is that you
 
05:14:54.628 --> 05:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
05:14:58.868 --> 05:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
60 within 30 days and 80 within 45 days
 
05:15:00.628 --> 05:15:00.638 align:start position:0%
and right now you're just starting to
 
05:15:02.230 --> 05:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
schedule people who made their appeal
 
05:15:04.230 --> 05:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
in october and i'm not sure what the
 
05:15:06.150 --> 05:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
implication of that is is being so far
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
out of compliance with the federal
 
05:15:07.440 --> 05:15:08.948 align:start position:0%
out of compliance with the federal
standards

05:15:08.948 --> 05:15:08.958 align:start position:0%
standards
 
05:15:10.628 --> 05:15:10.638 align:start position:0%
okay representative walls i appreciate
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
that mr lavers
 
05:15:14.948 --> 05:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
could you get representative walls's
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
phone number these are obviously not
 
05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
budget questions but they are legitimate
 
05:15:21.510 --> 05:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions and give her a call
 
05:15:23.190 --> 05:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
later when we are done with the budget
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
hearing i've got one more budget
 
05:15:27.190 --> 05:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
or one more money related question well
 
05:15:28.708 --> 05:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
you haven't asked any money related
 
05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
questions yet as far as the budget goes
 
05:15:30.480 --> 05:15:31.510 align:start position:0%
questions yet as far as the budget goes
so

05:15:31.510 --> 05:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:33.190 --> 05:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
if you do have something related to the
 
05:15:34.788 --> 05:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
budget i appreciate your helping your
 
05:15:37.190 --> 05:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
constituents i want to get you that help
 
05:15:38.948 --> 05:15:38.958 align:start position:0%
but not right now during a budget
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
hearing so do you have a budget question
 
05:15:43.110 --> 05:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
well it has to do with the interest on
 
05:15:44.550 --> 05:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
the overpayments i'm not sure if that
 
05:15:45.830 --> 05:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
qualifies his budget but they're
 
05:15:45.840 --> 05:15:46.390 align:start position:0%
qualifies his budget but they're
collecting

05:15:46.390 --> 05:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
05:15:47.830 --> 05:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
interest on the overpayments that
 
05:15:49.590 --> 05:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
they've forgiven and i'm concerned about
 
05:15:49.600 --> 05:15:50.628 align:start position:0%
they've forgiven and i'm concerned about
that

05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:15:52.150 --> 05:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's in the budget
 
05:15:54.550 --> 05:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
either you're going to take that up with
 
05:15:55.910 --> 05:15:55.920 align:start position:0%

05:22:09.910 --> 05:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
park where we heard from the agency that
 
05:22:11.430 --> 05:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
they could not
 
05:22:14.230 --> 05:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
have rvs plug in anymore because of the
 
05:22:14.240 --> 05:22:15.030 align:start position:0%
have rvs plug in anymore because of the
outmoded

05:22:15.030 --> 05:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
outmoded
 
05:22:18.948 --> 05:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
stuff it does eliminate the other three
 
05:22:20.708 --> 05:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
projects which also
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
equal another million dollars not
 
05:22:25.350 --> 05:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
because they aren't good but because we
 
05:22:26.868 --> 05:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
just don't have
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
enough money to do it all and i kind of
 
05:22:30.548 --> 05:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
question why
 
05:22:34.708 --> 05:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
the fort stark project doubled in cost
 
05:22:38.070 --> 05:22:38.080 align:start position:0%

05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
per member for 36 days salary
 
05:37:49.030 --> 05:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
this hb1 amendment
 
05:37:51.750 --> 05:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
changes the proposed annual pay for the
 
05:37:53.270 --> 05:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
five board members
 
05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
it also he also proposed
 
05:38:04.948 --> 05:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
moving the chairman of the board into a
 
05:38:04.958 --> 05:38:05.788 align:start position:0%
moving the chairman of the board into a
full-time

05:38:05.788 --> 05:38:05.798 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
05:38:08.310 --> 05:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
unclassified position right now the
 
05:38:09.590 --> 05:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
chairman is just
 
05:38:11.830 --> 05:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
a board member and will continue to be a
 
05:38:13.270 --> 05:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
board member
 
05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
this amendment further delays the start
 
05:38:19.110 --> 05:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
of the unclassified chairman
 
05:38:22.708 --> 05:38:22.718 align:start position:0%
by six months that chairman will still
 
05:38:23.830 --> 05:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
be a board member
 
05:38:25.750 --> 05:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
she's a board member now she will
 
05:38:28.548 --> 05:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
continue to be a board member
 
05:38:31.030 --> 05:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
and this change which again
 
05:38:32.948 --> 05:38:32.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately represent walls is not
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
going to be able to capture for
 
05:38:37.510 --> 05:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
transitional housing amounts to a
 
05:38:38.548 --> 05:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
savings of
 
05:38:41.190 --> 05:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
a hundred and a hundred thousand a
 
05:38:42.470 --> 05:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand seven hundred and

the effort associated with
 
05:44:45.270 --> 05:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship that you see in hb2
 
05:44:48.470 --> 05:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
is simply our attempt to square state
 
05:44:48.480 --> 05:44:49.110 align:start position:0%
is simply our attempt to square state
law

05:44:49.110 --> 05:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:44:52.070 --> 05:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
with the reality of federal control over
 
05:44:53.510 --> 05:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
registered apprenticeship
 
05:44:56.628 --> 05:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire since 2007
 
05:44:59.030 --> 05:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
the state apprenticeship council has had
 
05:44:59.750 --> 05:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
no role
 
05:45:01.830 --> 05:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
in the approval or recommendation of

registered apprenticeships
 
05:45:06.310 --> 05:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
the council is simply advisory and
 
05:45:06.320 --> 05:45:07.350 align:start position:0%
the council is simply advisory and
supportive

05:45:07.350 --> 05:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
supportive
 
05:45:09.190 --> 05:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
a letter from the u.s department of

federal office of
 
05:45:18.708 --> 05:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
office of apprenticeship will assume
 
05:45:21.270 --> 05:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
full responsibility and authority
 
05:45:23.110 --> 05:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
over registered apprenticeship in new
 
05:45:24.948 --> 05:45:24.958 align:start position:0%

dated august 14 2017 states in relative
 
05:45:36.628 --> 05:45:36.638 align:start position:0%
relative relevant part quote we are in
 
05:45:38.150 --> 05:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
agreement that the effect of this
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
legislative change is that the state
 
05:45:42.390 --> 05:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
relinquishes the authority to register
 
05:45:44.310 --> 05:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship programs
 
05:45:47.670 --> 05:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
end quote so he's

but then we wanted to have a check to

05:45:59.510 --> 05:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
see
 
05:46:02.868 --> 05:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
if it really was the federal law
 
05:46:05.030 --> 05:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
madam chairman my recollection is is we
 
05:46:06.150 --> 05:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
