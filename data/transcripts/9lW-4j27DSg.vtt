the uh
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
essentially the testimony that we heard
 
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.550 align:start position:0%
essentially the testimony that we heard
uh

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
was was overwhelmingly in favor of
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
doing something about cyanobacteria
 
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.629 align:start position:0%
doing something about cyanobacteria
and

00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
what the bill stated was to establish a
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
commission to look at
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
what we can do to
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
mitigate and control cyanobacteria
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
after talking to several folks
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
after the testimony
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
it occurred to us that it might be
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
better just to direct des to do a plan
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
and that we would achieve the same
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
results only
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
much quicker than it would be to do a
 
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.310 align:start position:0%
much quicker than it would be to do a
commission

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
des has agreed to do this plan
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
what i would propose in this amendment
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
is that we direct ees to develop a plan
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
by november of 2023
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
which is what they state is the the
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
quickest they could do it
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.150 align:start position:0%
that would
address

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
controlling and mitigating cyanobacteria
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's been much controversy about this
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman renzel for the record
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
randy pelletier i'm the director of the
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
water division at des
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
and to speak to the amendment that you
 
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.870 align:start position:0%
and to speak to the amendment that you
just

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
heard about is uh we support it we
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh cyanobacteria in the last couple of
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
years has
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
grown increasingly in numbers and areas
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
and lakes
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
is something that we think would be more
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
timely to address the issues
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
with performing a study and
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
i i think it makes a lot of sense the
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
commissions have a tendency to
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
languish for a while and i think we can
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
get on this
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
once the bill is signed ultimately
 
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.870 align:start position:0%
once the bill is signed ultimately
hopefully

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to put a plan in place to
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
try and move along a report and what we
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
believe is necessary to at least manage
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
and and i want to make it very clear we
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
won't eradicate cyanobacteria but we
 
00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
won't eradicate cyanobacteria but we
certainly

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
will look at tools and approaches to
 
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.590 align:start position:0%
will look at tools and approaches to
manage

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
manage
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
uh the causes of them if we can
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i think it's uh the amendment is
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
it was during the testimony um
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
that we discovered a couple of things
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
what's problematic with this bill is
 
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.870 align:start position:0%
what's problematic with this bill is
that

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
on our lakes we have
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
i believe the number was something to
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
the effect of a hundred
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
and seven thousand registered boats
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.070 align:start position:0%
and seven thousand registered boats
um

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
they all produce a lot of weight
 
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.830 align:start position:0%
they all produce a lot of weight
uh

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
testimony uh
 
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.870 align:start position:0%
testimony uh
from

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
the uh opponents of this bill
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
said that they uh work hard in the
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
industry to make sure that they're
 
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.470 align:start position:0%
industry to make sure that they're
educated

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
educated
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
as to what what to do what not to do
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
there was also problematic things on the
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
idea of enforcement
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
you would have separate
 
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.549 align:start position:0%
you would have separate
distances

00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
distances
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
for different activities and boats
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
and then finally
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
the other reason that i think bears some
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire according to our
 
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.510 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire according to our
governor

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
was ranked uh the number one state for
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
freedom uh by the cato institute so with
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
all of those things in in this i ask
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
that you uh move this to be itled thank
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your second
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
briefly thank you mr chairman um i echo
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
the comments of my fellow representative
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
and further state that based upon the
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard during the hearing
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
and my review of the minnesota report i
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to the on the
 
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.390 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak to the on the
motion

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
representative gottling thank you uh i
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
would just uh like say i'll be voting
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
against the itl
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i believe that the voices of the
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people that we heard from
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
including the groups that we work
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
closely with such as new hampshire lakes
 
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.149 align:start position:0%
closely with such as new hampshire lakes
the

00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
rivers management advisory commission
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
des and many many other lake and
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
watershed committees that express their
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
strong concerns
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that their interests need to
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
be represented also and
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
so i will be voting against
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
anyone anyone else wish to speak on the
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
bill representative smith
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i will be speaking
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
i mean i will be voting against the itl
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
motion and what what became evident in
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
the testimony uh in my mind was that a
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
lot of people believe that this would
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
limit wake boats to a
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
further distance from shore than they
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
now have which is 150 feet but this bill
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
only addresses the activity of wake
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
surfing and wake surfing is pretty easy
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
to differentiate between other
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
wake sports such as wake boarding and
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
tubing which require uh which
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
are more fun if there's a lot of wake
 
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.389 align:start position:0%
are more fun if there's a lot of wake
but

00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
the wake surfing the person is only like
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
eight ten feet at the most behind the
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
boat and they usually do not even have a
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
tow rope
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
and so this activity is a specific
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
activity and i don't think it's going to
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
affect tourism uh
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
as much as
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
some people had us believe
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
and then also i believe that the the
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
wake and the waves produced by this
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
activity according to two or three
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
reports that i've read
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
not just the saint anthony falls one uh
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
do say that the
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
waves produced by wake surfing are
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
measurably larger than from any other
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
activity and so therefore we do have the
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
problems with people's docs being
 
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.350 align:start position:0%
problems with people's docs being
affected

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
affected
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
kids getting knocked down by these large
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
waves so it would only benefit
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
people using the lake
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
as well as people on the shore to
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
increase the distance the safe passage
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
distance when engaged in wake surfing
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to speak on

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh town town roads but they're in the
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
compact area
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh also
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
concern that
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
having the
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh the bills
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
or it was concerned that
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.509 align:start position:0%
the uh
passing

00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
passing
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.389 align:start position:0%
of uh
authorization

00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
would uh which would go go to the
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh town
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh the town legislative body
 
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.870 align:start position:0%
uh the town legislative body
uh

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
that the rescission of the of the
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
decision of the town legislative body
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh didn't didn't wasn't symmetrical
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
didn't match
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
so the way this
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
we've it was rewritten so that
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
the majority by the majority vote of the
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
legislative body of a town council or
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
any legal meeting or after et cetera et
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
cetera you can
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
the town may authorize the use of class
 
00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:26.470 align:start position:0%
the town may authorize the use of class
five

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
four five and class six highways
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
and it goes it later goes on to say
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
except in case of emergency by vote of
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
the legislative body of the city or town
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
at any legal meeting
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera the town may rescind
 
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.590 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera the town may rescind
the

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
town may resend a previous authorization
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
and may change the allowable usage of
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
class 5
 
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.830 align:start position:0%
class 5
6

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
6
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
class 4 5 and 6
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
highways by ohrvs so another in other
 
00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:03.350 align:start position:0%
highways by ohrvs so another in other
words

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
if you if the town approves it it ha it
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
would it was a question as to whether
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
the approach whether the rescission
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
would be the same
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
and this clears that up
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
it it is it will be the same
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.670 align:start position:0%

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
0775
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
anyone wish to speak on the on the bill
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
represent vegan
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i support this
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill because i think it's smart that we
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
allow local control of ohrv
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
road usage and the amendment makes this
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
more important of a bill to me
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
because it allows towns who might want
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
to allow ohrp to travel on the road to
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
then understand and deal with the
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
repercussions and if they find those
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
repercussions being damaging to that
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
town they can then
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
rescind and i think that's an important
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
impact on north especially for us in the
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
north country
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
that sometimes it sounds good to have
 
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:30.150 align:start position:0%
that sometimes it sounds good to have
trout

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
trout
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
travelers and tourists utilizing the
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
roads and then when it becomes a cost or
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
a safety
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
or a community issue
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
towns are in a difficult position on how
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
to unravel what they've laid out and i
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
think this bill helps give that
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
unraveling an opportunity to occur and
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's why i would support it and thank
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%

to address
 
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.710 align:start position:0%

is
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
best handled
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh by the commission of the
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
was 1188 house bill 1188
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
was created created a commission to

study the the
 
00:41:13.599 --> 00:41:14.390 align:start position:0%
study the the
the

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
issues concerning
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
ohrvs and their uses on public roads
 
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.030 align:start position:0%
ohrvs and their uses on public roads
especially

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.220 align:start position:0%
especially
so

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:22.230 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:24.150 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
i i feel that it is best handled there
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
and you can always bring it back if
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not satisfied but
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
this is i think is the best place for it
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
now would be in that commission
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on the uh on
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
the bill yes
 
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.190 align:start position:0%
the bill yes
yes

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to mention that the court
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
has recently come down with a decision
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
in gorham in favor of the homeowners and
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
against the towns
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
and saying that damages are due
 
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.870 align:start position:0%
and saying that damages are due
so

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.109 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative kelly
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair yeah i just i wanted
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
decision or the idea to put this in
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
front of the commission that we're
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
hoping to establish i think that
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh there is a
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
there in most cases there's already a
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
remedy in place and what the problem
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
amounts to is a messaging issue people
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't know who to contact they don't
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
know to reach out to the club if the
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
club has the the class flyercast
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
classics wrote as a trail on their map
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
they will be able to apply for funds
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
to rectify a number of those issues
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
so i think that what this amounts to is
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
a messaging problem or a communication
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
problem and i'm hoping that the
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
commission will be best suited to deal
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 1292 which would permit the
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
use of drones or unmanned aerial
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles on the statewide trail system
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
the most of the testimony we heard on
 
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
this bill was addressed uh about was
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
discussing the use of
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
drones in state parks which are not even
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
included on the bill although a small
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
amount of state trails do go through
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
state parks
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
and it seemed to me that
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
that was kind of a a off a little
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
off-kilter and if we look at the
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
statewide trail system
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
majority of those trails are on private
 
00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.270 align:start position:0%
majority of those trails are on private
land

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
land
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
and when people uh give permission to
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
the state to include their property in
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
the statewide trail system
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
they fill out a form
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
and there is a trail use agreement
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
between dncr parks and rec
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
and the home and the land owner
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
and there are you know some of these are
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
like the trail use agreement is four
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
pages long and nowhere in it does it
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
include drones
 
00:46:09.119 --> 00:46:10.069 align:start position:0%
include drones
and

00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
so every
 
00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.790 align:start position:0%
so every
easement

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
easement
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the state would have to be where the
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
the ohrv's on their property
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
would or would allow you know they'd
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
have to include drones in the agreement
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
so all of those easement agreements
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
would have to be done over again
 
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.630 align:start position:0%
would have to be done over again
and

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony in the committee that
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes we will have no
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
statewide trail system because
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
landowners are going to
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
not want the drones uh taking off from
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
their properties
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
one of the complaints we heard about the
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
problem that why we can't have drones we
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
did have to do with state parks and it
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
had to do with the slow
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
perm how slow the permitting process was
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
on when you were trying to uh get a
 
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.750 align:start position:0%
on when you were trying to uh get a
permit

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
permit
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
to use a drone to do for commercial
 
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.069 align:start position:0%
to use a drone to do for commercial
purposes

00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
since state parks are not the exact same
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
thing as state wide trail system it's it
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
was total misnomer
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
so i think that this bill is not ready
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
for prime time it also includes drones
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
up to 50 pounds
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
and most p you know i mean that's a
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy duty drone that is not your
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
basic you know buy it at walmart drone
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
so i think it's uh i think the bill's
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time and i would
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
support itl
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
i ask that we itl it thank you
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speak to your second
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
i would mr chair thank you so much um i
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
echo the sentiments of representative
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
in the part especially that
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
this will compromise the statewide trail
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
system and compromise easements that
 
00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.510 align:start position:0%
system and compromise easements that
homeowners

00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
grant to the state and
 
00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.109 align:start position:0%
grant to the state and
in

00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
all recognition of representative huff
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
the freedoms that landowners have that
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
would be compromised by their privacy
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
being impacted by drones on their
 
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
personal land so not only would it be a
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
compromising position
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
for paperwork and legal to rewrite all
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
those easements but it would then put
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
landowners in compromised positions and
 
00:48:23.839 --> 00:48:25.030 align:start position:0%
landowners in compromised positions and
therefore

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%

this bill
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
will add an unnecessary directive
 
00:51:11.599 --> 00:51:12.470 align:start position:0%
will add an unnecessary directive
to

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
the state police and the marine patrol
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
both of which are excellent at their
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
jobs and they are always willing to come
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
by and let us know anything that's going
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
on so that we can make informed
 
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.309 align:start position:0%
on so that we can make informed
decisions

00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
so i just
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
i feel that this bill is just adding an
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
extra layer that is just not needed
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative post do you wish to speak

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
yes um i echo the sentiment that um we
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
believe that uh all the information will
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
come to us um if we have any questions
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
we rely on um
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
them to get
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
information to us that's accurate and
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
is there anyone wish to speak on the
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
motion representative gotland thank you
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
first of all i think that with the
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
amount of change over we have in our
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
committees every two years not just with
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
members but often with the chairperson
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
there is sometimes a loss of the
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
institutional history
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the fact that
 
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.630 align:start position:0%
and the fact that
the

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
captain dunleavy was
 
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.150 align:start position:0%
captain dunleavy was
not

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
was amenable to doing this for us uh i
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
think says a lot
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
and i would say that when when
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
one of our committee members looked at
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
me and said well
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
don't they communicate with us like this
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
every year and i said no and i pointed
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
out that the bill that i was sponsoring
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
on efoils
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
that did not come
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.390 align:start position:0%
from uh
the

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
department that came from my
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
observations and my particular chief of
 
00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.510 align:start position:0%
observations and my particular chief of
police

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
so i feel that
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
giving us a heads up
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
could save us
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary bill writing if for instance
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
there's something already in the works
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
or if
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
this is something that's
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
being carried out some other way and
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
marine patrol
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
has the opportunity to go to a national
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
conference every year
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
therefore is often ahead of us
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
on what are things that are going to be
 
00:53:39.359 --> 00:53:40.470 align:start position:0%
on what are things that are going to be
emerging

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
emerging
 
00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:41.670 align:start position:0%
emerging
so

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
so i will vote
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
against the itl and hope many of you
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
so anyone else wishes to speak on the
 
00:53:53.839 --> 00:53:57.829 align:start position:0%
so anyone else wishes to speak on the
bill

00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.839 --> 00:53:59.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i think there's
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
never anything wrong with more
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
transparency in getting a report that
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
echoes the sentiments of
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
other representatives of
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
being aware
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
i am a new member of this committee
 
00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.510 align:start position:0%
i am a new member of this committee
so

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
i'm unaware of anything that you've done
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
for the last year and a half and a
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
report for me to look at would be
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
helpful and i think having those type of
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
be able to articulate issues that are
 
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.430 align:start position:0%
be able to articulate issues that are
occurring

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
it would educate representatives it
 
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.549 align:start position:0%
it would educate representatives it
would

00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
save legislative office of legislative
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
services extra time if
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
i were to file a bill that if i had read
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
a report i wouldn't have filed that bill
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
so all those things
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
are important to me
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
anyone else what else was that
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
really quick um thanks i just wanted to
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
note that um i'm in favor of the report
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
i like the idea of the report i think it
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
will be definitely helpful but
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that the report
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
has already been agreed to where
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
the captain has agreed uh is agreeable
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
to providing the report um without a law
 
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.190 align:start position:0%
to providing the report um without a law
so

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%

01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:25.839 align:start position:0%
the what we um thank you mr chair one of
 
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
the things we learned in testimony
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:00:31.359 --> 01:00:32.230 align:start position:0%
from the
from

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
the head of the port authority
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
was that there is already a
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
plan in place
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
where people can
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
give their mooring up for a season
 
01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:50.230 align:start position:0%
give their mooring up for a season
and

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
no this has been in
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
they have a temporary seasonal use of
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
moorings program which is set up through
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
rules and no one has ever applied to use
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
that program or to give up their mooring
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
for a season
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
and take advantage of those rules
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
so and then there is a long wait list
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
for getting your own mooring and that
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know that is a problem but there is
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
we have a limited amount of sea coast
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
and also there are some areas where
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
there is a long wait and there are other
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
areas where it is easy to get a mooring
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
so it just it seems very complicated
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of liability issues
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
involved in this bill
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
and it just seems like it's it's just
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
not a good bill
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
and also there is a concern that people
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
who have homes on the
 
01:01:46.559 --> 01:01:48.390 align:start position:0%
who have homes on the
seacoast

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
seacoast
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
for instance in portsmouth or around
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
nuka around the island of newcastle who
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
may have a mooring in front of their
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
home and they'd like to
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
lease out their home for a air b use it
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
as an airbnb and although this bill
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
would not allow you to charge for a
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
mooring you could raise the price of
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
your airbnb if you
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
had a mooring in front of your house and
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
that would be a huge benefit which would
 
01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.430 align:start position:0%
that would be a huge benefit which would
really

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
not be a good thing
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the liability issues as much as
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
anything else so i would ask people to
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to you second
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair yeah i just i would
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
add along with what representative smith
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
said that that i think that this uh
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
program would open up uh abuse um and it
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
it would be difficult to enforce the the
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
no payment rule i think that that would
 
01:02:47.839 --> 01:02:48.630 align:start position:0%
no payment rule i think that that would
be

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
a difficult thing to police um and i
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
just think that their current program is
 
01:02:52.559 --> 01:02:59.589 align:start position:0%
just think that their current program is
working

01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to speak
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
to the motion
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
represent representative harp
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just very briefly uh
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm a co-sponsor of this bill with the
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and he did
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
convince me that this is a different
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
program than the seasonal it's only up
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
to 30 days so
 
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:34.309 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
in testimony we heard uh and i was
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
educated um about the lack of um
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
liability control by the more owner
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
and when they pass on that access to
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
their more to someone there's no
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
follow through by the original more
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
owner and i get concerned that someone
 
01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.510 align:start position:0%
owner and i get concerned that someone
could

01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
use the mooring
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
cause damages in the area disappear on
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
the owner and then now there's going to
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
be a blame of who is liable
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
so if if the
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
substitute more users boat damages other
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
boats then their their time period is up
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
and they leave town and no one knows
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
that damages was caused it's back
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's because it can create problems of
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
who is at
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
um you know who is responsible and i
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
the other side of the issue on this one
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
for me is as well how do we know if
 
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
no funds do
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
transfer hands we all know that people
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
make handshake deals all the time and um
 
01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.190 align:start position:0%
make handshake deals all the time and um
that's

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%

before legislation is introduced to put

something into a statute uh be i believe
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
the people who live in those a on those
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
pawns need to

but hopefully they will be able to
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
figure out a solution without

uh we're listening to testimony on uh
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 155 and
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh completely understand the desire to
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
eliminate rules and regulations required
 
01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.750 align:start position:0%
eliminate rules and regulations required
for

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
personal fires
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments was that it was
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
rarely used and that it was difficult
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
i for one do it and
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
it takes less than a minute um to to
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
sign on and and to get that permit
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh what really swayed me on this though
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
fire safety folks came in and they all
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
recommended that we keep the permitting
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
process from a safety perspective
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
although new hampshire does have a low
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
incidence of fires we would like to keep
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
and so i think that uh
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
understanding the desire to eliminate
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations uh
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
is compelling but uh i think we should
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
look at it a little bit further and
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
study it uh to make sure we do it in a
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
safe and uh
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
manner that
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
complies with the
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations of our fire safety
 
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.229 align:start position:0%
recommendations of our fire safety
people

01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative post you wish to speak to

01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
the ease of use you go on your computer
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
and and you click a button and within
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
two minutes you can get it done it's a
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
very simple process
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
um however for those folks that
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't have computers they can go to
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
their local fire chief and get it it's a
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
very very simple thing and the other
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
thing that they do is they'll come to
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
your homes and they'll inspect where you
 
01:13:40.159 --> 01:13:40.870 align:start position:0%
your homes and they'll inspect where you
will

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
have a fire and
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
an example for my family we built a nice
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
big pit
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
however at the end of the pit was a
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
great big stump and they told us we
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't have the fire there because
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:13:54.719 --> 01:13:55.669 align:start position:0%
that would
could

01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
cause the roots of that
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
tree that stump to start burning and
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
could actually go into underground a
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
fire and go into our neighbor's yard
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
which was very heavily treed so this is
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
why i support
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
the ita or interim study on this bill
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on the bill
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative egan
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um this this bill's
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
an issue for me and while interim study
 
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
is plausible i would have preferred it'd
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
be itl
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
i think it's rare that the new hampshire
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
timber owners association and new
 
01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.870 align:start position:0%
timber owners association and new
hampshire

01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
site for production of forests are on
 
01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.070 align:start position:0%
site for production of forests are on
the

01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
distinct same side of this issue and
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
both gave testimony and reinforced with
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
information that they sent to the
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
committee talking about how bad of an
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
idea this bill is
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
as well i did speak with a constituent
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
who was a firefighter
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
in my neighborhood who told me a
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
unpermitted fire
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
in dalton drew six towns of fire crews
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
volunteers risking their own lives put
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
out a fire because someone didn't get a
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
permit to start a fire when they could
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
have been educated by their fire
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
department their fire chief
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
and it causes
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
concern for me that we want to
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
do away with a smart piece of
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
legislation that protects our
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods our forests so while i'll
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
support an interim study i would
 
01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.630 align:start position:0%
support an interim study i would
preferred

01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
preferred
 
01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.110 align:start position:0%
preferred

01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
ending of a ridiculous bill that
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
just doesn't make sense so thank you for
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
hearing me out
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%

01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
i have a motion of interim study uh is
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
there a
 
01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.830 align:start position:0%
there a
second

01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
second by representative smith
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative gottling do you wish to
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes um
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
extending how much of the merrimack
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
river is protected
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
but not in the way that is being done in
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
this particular bill where they feel
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's bypassing the process that's
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
already uh
 
01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.390 align:start position:0%
already uh
uh

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.430 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
so it it seems as if you know we should
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
be able to uh it perhaps one of the
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
reasons is that the
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
process often takes several years
 
01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
and this may be a shortcut to getting
 
01:18:27.199 --> 01:18:28.390 align:start position:0%
and this may be a shortcut to getting
the

01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
protection that is wanted but i think
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
interim study may let us figure out a
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
good way to do it without
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
totally overwriting the process that's
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative smith to wish to speak on
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
yes it has come to the committee's
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
attention also that department of
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
environmental services has now sent
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
letters to the committees of communities
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
part of this designation
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
and uh once we hear back that those
 
01:19:07.199 --> 01:19:08.390 align:start position:0%
and uh once we hear back that those
committees

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
communities are
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
in favor of this that would be one step
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
forward and um
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
on this process but the process has
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
worked well for a number of years and it
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
makes sure that everyone involved and
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
anyone who lives near the river or has a
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
business near whatever river it is
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
will have a say and be able to
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
act responsibly
 
01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:34.830 align:start position:0%
act responsibly
and

01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
vote to designate their river
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
with a full array of knowledge so i
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
any anyone else wish to
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:19:58.630 --> 01:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
i also support the interim study and i
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add along with echoing
 
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
the comments of my colleagues that i
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
know that this kind of a project takes
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
volunteers and it takes stewards in the
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
community and this would give the time
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
in order for that process to develop
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of volunteers involved
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
with being a steward of the river and
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
i think this will give us the time thank
 
01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.790 align:start position:0%
i think this will give us the time thank
you

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think the chair would like to say one
 
01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.030 align:start position:0%
i think the chair would like to say one
thing

01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
i applaud the
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh initiative of the uh of the
 
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.070 align:start position:0%
uh initiative of the uh of the
representative

01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
there it because i think the
 
01:20:42.639 --> 01:20:44.229 align:start position:0%
there it because i think the
the

01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
protection of the rivers are important
 
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
however there there is a real reason
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
that for the for this process to be
 
01:20:56.239 --> 01:20:58.310 align:start position:0%
that for the for this process to be
as

01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
what some would say is slow and
 
01:21:00.639 --> 01:21:01.990 align:start position:0%
what some would say is slow and
cumbersome

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
cumbersome
 
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:02.709 align:start position:0%
cumbersome
it

01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
about taking uh changing the use or
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
restricting the use of the of an area of
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
other of property of land that other
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
people may own
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
so everyone should have
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
their say in it there should be no about
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
there should be no surprises
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
and that takes time and it takes effort
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
but uh so this the process has worked
 
01:21:30.159 --> 01:21:31.189 align:start position:0%
but uh so this the process has worked
well

01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:21:31.199 --> 01:21:32.310 align:start position:0%
well
and

01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
i realized that we we could have
 
01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.390 align:start position:0%
i realized that we we could have
uh

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
do a
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding type of bill that
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
goes around the process
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
but that would be wrong
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
so i suppose do support the
 
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
the effort
 
01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.750 align:start position:0%
the effort
so

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
see no one else wish to speak
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
on will the on the effort on the motion
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
to uh interim study
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%

schools etc
 
03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
03:02:01.349 --> 03:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:01.359 --> 03:02:02.550 align:start position:0%
 
testing

03:02:02.550 --> 03:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
testing
 
03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:03.750 align:start position:0%
testing
for

03:02:03.750 --> 03:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:02:07.750 --> 03:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
perform you know pfas chemicals
 
03:02:09.910 --> 03:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
at certain times
 
03:02:09.920 --> 03:02:12.469 align:start position:0%
at certain times
and

03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
we are concerned about
 
03:02:17.750 --> 03:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
who pays and why
 
03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:19.590 align:start position:0%
who pays and why
uh

03:02:19.590 --> 03:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:02:21.990 --> 03:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to
 
03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
talk about that or well i'll recognize
 
03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:26.070 align:start position:0%
talk about that or well i'll recognize
or

03:02:26.070 --> 03:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:02:29.750 --> 03:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:31.510 --> 03:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
the only thing i'd like to know mr
 
03:02:32.950 --> 03:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
chairman are we dealing with the bill as
 
03:02:34.630 --> 03:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
amended did we vote on the amendment at
 
03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:41.429 --> 03:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
good question
 
03:02:45.349 --> 03:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
so i think we did i know the moment the
 
03:02:46.950 --> 03:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
amendment was placed but i don't know if
 
03:02:49.190 --> 03:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
we if we did vote i thought we had but
 
03:02:53.510 --> 03:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be
 
03:02:56.550 --> 03:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
well it was this one this was an
 
03:02:56.560 --> 03:03:06.070 align:start position:0%
well it was this one this was an
executive

03:03:06.070 --> 03:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:08.710 --> 03:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
what i would suggest then sir is that we
 
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
basically move to amend the bill
 
03:03:12.309 --> 03:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
at this time and i'll move the the
 
03:03:14.150 --> 03:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
amendment uh well i guess this is
 
03:03:16.070 --> 03:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
workshop what i would do is is to move
 
03:03:17.990 --> 03:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
to have it amended by the amendment that
 
03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
we have in place which is uh
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
oh five eight five
 
03:03:22.319 --> 03:03:23.590 align:start position:0%
oh five eight five
um

03:03:23.590 --> 03:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:25.510 --> 03:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
and that that's that be what we work
 
03:03:28.950 --> 03:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
with as far as the bill is concerned
 
03:03:33.030 --> 03:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
all right well let's look at 0.585
 
03:03:34.230 --> 03:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative smith do you have a
 
03:03:35.590 --> 03:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
question yeah does that
 
03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
does the amendment uh representative
 
03:03:39.990 --> 03:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
grassy replace the entire bill yeah yes
 
03:03:41.110 --> 03:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
it does well
 
03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:54.870 --> 03:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think it replaced that doesn't
 
03:03:58.469 --> 03:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
it's we're talking about amendment 0.585
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
yeah it re it replaces the bill and it
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
adds a section 3 in it which uh
 
03:04:04.710 --> 03:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
basically exempts uh schools which are
 
03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:05.429 align:start position:0%
basically exempts uh schools which are
uh

03:04:05.429 --> 03:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:06.870 --> 03:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
or talks about the testing should be
 
03:04:08.469 --> 03:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
done at sources and exempt schools that
 
03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:16.469 --> 03:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
you're right
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
it does well it's it's not quite it says
 
03:04:24.389 --> 03:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:24.399 --> 03:04:25.110 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:04:25.110 --> 03:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:04:27.110 --> 03:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
well you have this you have a section
 
03:04:29.349 --> 03:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
one where it says pfast level of
 
03:04:31.110 --> 03:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
drinking water schools and child care
 
03:04:32.830 --> 03:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
facilities amend
 
03:04:37.110 --> 03:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
485 by inserting after second 17a the
 
03:04:39.750 --> 03:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
following new subsection
 
03:04:42.469 --> 03:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
and then it says
 
03:04:42.479 --> 03:04:45.910 align:start position:0%
and then it says
485

03:04:45.910 --> 03:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:48.389 --> 03:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
colon 17b
 
03:04:53.590 --> 03:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
and that that's where the the uh
 
03:04:56.230 --> 03:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
where the amendment starts so there is
 
03:04:56.240 --> 03:04:57.030 align:start position:0%
where the amendment starts so there is
us

03:04:57.030 --> 03:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:04:59.910 --> 03:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
a there is a two sec two some of the
 
03:05:01.269 --> 03:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
line sentence
 
03:05:03.269 --> 03:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
in the beginning correct
 
03:05:05.510 --> 03:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
well yeah there is basically the the
 
03:05:05.520 --> 03:05:06.550 align:start position:0%
well yeah there is basically the the
introduction

03:05:06.550 --> 03:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
03:05:08.710 --> 03:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
section the new new sections it talks
 
03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
about pfs level drinking water schools
 
03:05:13.670 --> 03:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
and child care facilities and also for
 
03:05:15.349 --> 03:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
per and fluorocarbon substance levels
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
and drinking water in schools and
 
03:05:18.230 --> 03:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
licensed child care facilities but
 
03:05:20.070 --> 03:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's right here that's what it's not
 
03:05:22.230 --> 03:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
so basically it just takes it's the one
 
03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
section it says one new section right
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's the only one line that it keeps
 
03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
and the rest of it changes yeah so
 
03:05:33.190 --> 03:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
so you know in effect it really does uh
 
03:05:34.630 --> 03:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
replaces the whole place pretty much
 
03:05:35.910 --> 03:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the two
 
03:05:38.230 --> 03:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
introductory sentences
 
03:05:40.710 --> 03:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
but as i think we can discuss
 
03:05:42.550 --> 03:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
we can discuss right off of the
 
03:05:44.389 --> 03:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
amendment and uh
 
03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
we'll just maybe we'll just be working
 
03:05:49.269 --> 03:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
with the amen whether we amend the
 
03:05:49.279 --> 03:05:50.469 align:start position:0%
with the amen whether we amend the
amendment

03:05:50.469 --> 03:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
if i i will speak mr chairman and i
 
03:05:55.030 --> 03:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
think that one of the things that it
 
03:05:56.710 --> 03:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
does here and there was a concern that
 
03:05:57.990 --> 03:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
people had
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
about the funding of the of the bill and
 
03:06:03.110 --> 03:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
that uh des said that they had funding
 
03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
available currently
 
03:06:06.630 --> 03:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh that they would go out and complete
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
these uh schools and child care centers
 
03:06:11.110 --> 03:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
that had not been tested uh some of them
 
03:06:12.710 --> 03:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
haven't us but these are the ones that
 
03:06:13.750 --> 03:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be tested they would take it
 
03:06:15.510 --> 03:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
out of existing funding
 
03:06:17.349 --> 03:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
and a concern i have is if we ought to
 
03:06:18.950 --> 03:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
address any additional funding would
 
03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
that create a situation where we would
 
03:06:22.950 --> 03:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note and then we can't
 
03:06:24.309 --> 03:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
send it to a second committee it's too
 
03:06:25.429 --> 03:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
late to send to the second committee at
 
03:06:27.349 --> 03:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
this time so basically it would die
 
03:06:29.830 --> 03:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that if we want to or if
 
03:06:31.349 --> 03:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
there is a need
 
03:06:33.670 --> 03:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
if des feels that there is a need to
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
provide any additional funding that that
 
03:06:37.110 --> 03:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
could be addressed in the senate
 
03:06:38.469 --> 03:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
because that's the only place we can go
 
03:06:40.469 --> 03:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
really to add any additional funding in
 
03:06:45.510 --> 03:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:48.389 --> 03:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
smith for comment yes thank you mr chair
 
03:06:48.399 --> 03:06:49.590 align:start position:0%
smith for comment yes thank you mr chair
um

03:06:49.590 --> 03:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
brandon kernan from des is here and
 
03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
he has a um he has a handout that he'd
 
03:06:57.910 --> 03:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
like to share with members
 
03:07:00.309 --> 03:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
03:07:03.190 --> 03:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
that would help with the question of
 
03:07:04.710 --> 03:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
who's going to test how is it going to
 
03:07:06.469 --> 03:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
get test and what it's going to cost
 
03:07:08.309 --> 03:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean this is a work session so
 
03:07:08.319 --> 03:07:10.230 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean this is a work session so
it's

03:07:10.230 --> 03:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:07:14.469 --> 03:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman i'm brandon kernan
 
03:07:17.269 --> 03:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
i'm the administrator of the drinking
 
03:07:19.110 --> 03:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater bureau
 
03:07:21.269 --> 03:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
and i testified originally on house bill
 
03:07:21.279 --> 03:07:22.550 align:start position:0%
and i testified originally on house bill
1602

03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
1602
 
03:07:24.950 --> 03:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
i have not seen a copy of this uh
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
a proposed amendment
 
03:07:27.990 --> 03:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
but in thinking about today and i
 
03:07:30.309 --> 03:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
apologize for getting this too late it's
 
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
been incredibly busy for all of us
 
03:07:34.950 --> 03:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
we we wanted to provide some background
 
03:07:37.510 --> 03:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe some incremental steps that we
 
03:07:38.469 --> 03:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
can take
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
before maybe we pass
 
03:07:42.389 --> 03:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
legislation that
 
03:07:44.469 --> 03:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
imposes requirements both on these
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
entities and also des relative to
 
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
administering it
 
03:07:47.920 --> 03:07:49.590 align:start position:0%
administering it
um

03:07:49.590 --> 03:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:51.429 --> 03:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
one thing i just want to explain is that
 
03:07:52.550 --> 03:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
03:07:55.110 --> 03:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
regulates public water systems when we
 
03:07:57.269 --> 03:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
start talking about
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
having requirements for child care
 
03:08:01.590 --> 03:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
facilities and schools
 
03:08:03.269 --> 03:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
you're kind of expanding the entities
 
03:08:05.349 --> 03:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
that we have to work with from 2600
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
water systems to another 1500 entities
 
03:08:08.790 --> 03:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
that we don't even have in our databases
 
03:08:10.469 --> 03:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
yet or anything so it's
 
03:08:12.950 --> 03:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's a big lift and it's a lot of work
 
03:08:14.950 --> 03:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
and you have to think about the process
 
03:08:15.830 --> 03:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
that would
 
03:08:17.830 --> 03:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
that goes into place where
 
03:08:19.830 --> 03:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
we have to tell people the sample they
 
03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
have to collect the data that's
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
submitted to us we have to chase it we
 
03:08:24.550 --> 03:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
have to analyze it respond to it require
 
03:08:26.070 --> 03:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
mitigation require testing after
 
03:08:27.990 --> 03:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation requirement notification
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
verify public notification for 1500
 
03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:31.190 align:start position:0%
verify public notification for 1500
entities

03:08:31.190 --> 03:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
entities
 
03:08:32.550 --> 03:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
potentially at like 300 different
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
sampling taps in our testimony letter we
 
03:08:37.429 --> 03:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
explained some changes to the bill that
 
03:08:38.710 --> 03:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
would improve it and it sounds like this
 
03:08:40.469 --> 03:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
amendment might address it you know
 
03:08:43.349 --> 03:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
sampling just sources see i'm not
 
03:08:44.870 --> 03:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
sampling facilities that are connected
 
03:08:46.790 --> 03:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
to a public water supply
 
03:08:48.870 --> 03:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
that already are sampling for pfas at
 
03:08:50.389 --> 03:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
the source swells
 
03:08:52.150 --> 03:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
and then that des could use money
 
03:08:54.389 --> 03:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
dedicated to pfas that we have in hand
 
03:08:56.309 --> 03:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
over the next year i said 18 months
 
03:08:57.349 --> 03:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
originally but we could do it over the
 
03:09:00.389 --> 03:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
next year to offer to sample those 1500
 
03:09:03.269 --> 03:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
child care facilities and public schools
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
that aren't a public water system they
 
03:09:05.990 --> 03:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
essentially have a private well just
 
03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
like a homeowner has a private oil
 
03:09:08.389 --> 03:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
because they're small enough that they
 
03:09:10.870 --> 03:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
don't enter our regulatory
 
03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:12.550 align:start position:0%
don't enter our regulatory
spectrum

03:09:12.550 --> 03:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
spectrum
 
03:09:15.269 --> 03:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
and so what we propose here is that we
 
03:09:17.110 --> 03:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
do that sampling over next year and i
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
have to say it would be voluntary on the
 
03:09:22.229 --> 03:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
on the facilities part uh we have no
 
03:09:23.910 --> 03:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
authority to mandate they allow us on
 
03:09:25.670 --> 03:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
site and some will not they don't want
 
03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
to do with extra regulation or
 
03:09:27.680 --> 03:09:28.950 align:start position:0%
to do with extra regulation or
regulators

03:09:28.950 --> 03:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
regulators
 
03:09:30.630 --> 03:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
many will let us on
 
03:09:32.309 --> 03:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
and that we do two things
 
03:09:34.229 --> 03:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
one in the next couple months we provide
 
03:09:37.269 --> 03:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
this committee an interim report
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
right now we have
 
03:09:40.870 --> 03:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
data for all the public water systems
 
03:09:43.510 --> 03:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
that had sample for pfas it's about 1200
 
03:09:46.630 --> 03:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
systems 1600 sources and what we can do
 
03:09:49.990 --> 03:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
is match the 1500 child care facilities
 
03:09:52.710 --> 03:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
and schools with the water systems
 
03:09:53.910 --> 03:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
over the next couple months and then
 
03:09:56.790 --> 03:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
give you the pfas data for each
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
child care facility in school so we
 
03:10:00.389 --> 03:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
essentially have the data we have to
 
03:10:01.910 --> 03:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
match it up at this point because we
 
03:10:01.920 --> 03:10:02.630 align:start position:0%
match it up at this point because we
have

03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:10:04.389 --> 03:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
water system data and we need to connect
 
03:10:06.550 --> 03:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
it to the buildings that we have on a
 
03:10:07.830 --> 03:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
separate list
 
03:10:09.190 --> 03:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
and so within a couple months we can
 
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
give you that information which is
 
03:10:14.389 --> 03:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
about thirteen hundred fifty results out
 
03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
of fifteen hundred total of the
 
03:10:18.710 --> 03:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
empties we're talking about
 
03:10:20.469 --> 03:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
and so you can look at the data and see
 
03:10:22.630 --> 03:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
to what extent there's a a need to do
 
03:10:24.389 --> 03:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
more to require extra public
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
notification or parent notification or
 
03:10:28.309 --> 03:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
what have you
 
03:10:30.070 --> 03:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
and then over the next year collect that
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
additional data for the facilities that
 
03:10:34.150 --> 03:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
led us and then pull that back into the
 
03:10:36.229 --> 03:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
data summary and so within a year you'll
 
03:10:38.710 --> 03:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
have a full picture of what the exposure
 
03:10:41.349 --> 03:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
to pfas phases and these facilities and
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
based on that decide should we require
 
03:10:45.590 --> 03:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
three rounds of sampling over the next
 
03:10:47.910 --> 03:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
15 years should we require extra public
 
03:10:49.510 --> 03:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
notification beyond what the public
 
03:10:51.830 --> 03:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
water system already does
 
03:10:53.510 --> 03:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
but it would give useful information to
 
03:10:55.670 --> 03:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
make really good decisions within a year
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't be asking for any
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
additional funds from the legislature to
 
03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:10.229 --> 03:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
uh yes just a question you said that
 
03:11:12.150 --> 03:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
that you had no authority to go in and
 
03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
do the testing
 
03:11:16.950 --> 03:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
under this uh this bill it says that
 
03:11:19.110 --> 03:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
these facilities shall test so it may
 
03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
not be you that test them but they would
 
03:11:22.950 --> 03:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
be required to be tested um under
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
standards which you shall set and they
 
03:11:25.830 --> 03:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
would be submitting that information
 
03:11:28.150 --> 03:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
into you so this would remove that
 
03:11:29.670 --> 03:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
problem that you're saying that well
 
03:11:31.349 --> 03:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
there may be some places that we aren't
 
03:11:32.950 --> 03:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
able to test and this is true that all
 
03:11:35.190 --> 03:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
the tests gets all the facilities get
 
03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
tested and according to your records
 
03:11:39.269 --> 03:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
alone there are only about
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh 150 schools and child care centers
 
03:11:43.830 --> 03:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
that currently are not
 
03:11:45.990 --> 03:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
have not submitted data
 
03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
right i'm talking about our different
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
approach so yes if we went with your
 
03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
approach and the amendment
 
03:11:53.030 --> 03:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
they would be would have to but that's
 
03:11:54.229 --> 03:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
where there's a lot of resources
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
required because
 
03:11:57.510 --> 03:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
we'd have to produce sampling schedules
 
03:11:59.349 --> 03:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
for these facilities they would have to
 
03:12:01.830 --> 03:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
contract or contracted labs get results
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
feed into a database that doesn't exist
 
03:12:05.670 --> 03:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
for these facilities because we don't
 
03:12:07.030 --> 03:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
have these in our
 
03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
in our system right now
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then based on it we'd be issuing
 
03:12:12.469 --> 03:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
violation letters and making them have
 
03:12:14.469 --> 03:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
corrective action plans to mitigate an
 
03:12:16.389 --> 03:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
exceedance and then they'd have to prove
 
03:12:18.150 --> 03:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
they do that and then we'd also have to
 
03:12:18.160 --> 03:12:19.349 align:start position:0%
they do that and then we'd also have to
administer

03:12:19.349 --> 03:12:19.359 align:start position:0%
administer
 
03:12:20.630 --> 03:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
a notice that they have to do public
 
03:12:21.990 --> 03:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
notification and then they'd have to
 
03:12:23.590 --> 03:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
prove it to us and again we all have to
 
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
log that in database it's a big process
 
03:12:27.590 --> 03:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's like 11 points of contacts with
 
03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
these entities that we don't even work
 
03:12:31.269 --> 03:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
with right now you know they're used to
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
either healthy services if you're a
 
03:12:35.190 --> 03:12:35.200 align:start position:0%
child care facilities or department of
 
03:12:36.790 --> 03:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
education if you're a school and also
 
03:12:38.550 --> 03:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to have another regulator
 
03:12:40.870 --> 03:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
and ultimately in des i think most you
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
know really tries to hold out as long as
 
03:12:44.550 --> 03:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
we can before we get to that ultimately
 
03:12:45.990 --> 03:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
we'll be finding him you know so now
 
03:12:47.990 --> 03:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
we'd be finding very small daycares
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
which which is not
 
03:12:51.190 --> 03:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
you what we really want to think about
 
03:12:51.200 --> 03:12:52.550 align:start position:0%
you what we really want to think about
before

03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:12:54.389 --> 03:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
we get into that business so
 
03:12:55.990 --> 03:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
what i was proposing is just a solid
 
03:12:58.150 --> 03:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
approach to get information
 
03:13:00.469 --> 03:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
to the extent someone has a result over
 
03:13:01.910 --> 03:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
a standard
 
03:13:03.590 --> 03:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
almost any facility would take care of
 
03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
it and if they didn't have five thousand
 
03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
dollars to put a treatment system in or
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
a thousand if you just do one sink they
 
03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
get a bubbler or provide bottled water
 
03:13:13.750 --> 03:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
and put up a sign you know so
 
03:13:15.110 --> 03:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
i think this approach really would
 
03:13:15.120 --> 03:13:16.229 align:start position:0%
i think this approach really would
identify

03:13:16.229 --> 03:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
identify
 
03:13:18.790 --> 03:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
any remaining exposure and give us the
 
03:13:22.550 --> 03:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
in a cooperative way and there could be
 
03:13:26.630 --> 03:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
a weird issue out there you i mean
 
03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's always an exception but that's
 
03:13:36.550 --> 03:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
just just to clarify you said this
 
03:13:38.880 --> 03:13:39.910 align:start position:0%
just just to clarify you said this
approach

03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
approach
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
is that the amendment approach
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
or a separate approach oh i'm sorry it's
 
03:13:46.469 --> 03:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
the handout that i prepared just sort of
 
03:13:48.389 --> 03:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh which is different than the amendment
 
03:13:51.030 --> 03:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
yes i haven't seen the amendment
 
03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:56.710 align:start position:0%
yes i haven't seen the amendment
okay

03:13:56.710 --> 03:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:56.720 --> 03:13:58.150 align:start position:0%
 
yep

03:13:58.150 --> 03:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
and it's a bit it's a
 
03:14:01.349 --> 03:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
big improvement in our view from the
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
original bill we're just trying to think
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
of even a more streamlined approach to
 
03:14:06.229 --> 03:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
address this concern
 
03:14:08.229 --> 03:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't give up on the idea of
 
03:14:09.429 --> 03:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
doing more
 
03:14:11.670 --> 03:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory wise it just gives you i mean
 
03:14:12.790 --> 03:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
right now the committee doesn't have the
 
03:14:14.550 --> 03:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
full picture of if this is a real
 
03:14:16.309 --> 03:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
problem or not and what measures
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
therefore should be taken so within
 
03:14:20.070 --> 03:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
two months you would have
 
03:14:22.070 --> 03:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
basically 80 of the answers and then
 
03:14:23.750 --> 03:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
within a year you'll have as completed
 
03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
with pictures we have except for those
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
facilities that don't let us sample
 
03:14:28.950 --> 03:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
and then we can say well gee you know we
 
03:14:30.870 --> 03:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
have 10 percent exceedance this many
 
03:14:30.880 --> 03:14:31.750 align:start position:0%
have 10 percent exceedance this many
kids

03:14:31.750 --> 03:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
kids
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah we need to make sure we have this
 
03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
much sampling and then we have to have
 
03:14:36.389 --> 03:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
this additional notification beyond what
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
the public water systems do already it's
 
03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
just a thought and it's something that
 
03:14:42.469 --> 03:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
we can do with existing data and
 
03:14:48.389 --> 03:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:48.399 --> 03:14:49.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:14:49.269 --> 03:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
do you need legislation to do that or
 
03:14:55.110 --> 03:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
are you fully authorized to do that now
 
03:14:57.269 --> 03:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
we can i can commit to that we'll do
 
03:14:59.190 --> 03:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
this now we are we're able to do this
 
03:15:00.950 --> 03:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
you could put it into legislation to
 
03:15:03.269 --> 03:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
require it legally but i think we work
 
03:15:04.710 --> 03:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
with each other all the time we can
 
03:15:06.150 --> 03:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
commit to getting the data to you in two
 
03:15:07.910 --> 03:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
months that we have and then
 
03:15:09.990 --> 03:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
sampling wherever we can get access to
 
03:15:11.670 --> 03:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
within a year and i have the
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:22.389 --> 03:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:23.910 --> 03:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:15:26.070 --> 03:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
if we put this bill or this amendment
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
into legislation
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
will this make you make protection of
 
03:15:33.269 --> 03:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
young children's drinking water in these
 
03:15:36.389 --> 03:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
schools from pfaster prioritization when
 
03:15:39.269 --> 03:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
you look at what you're doing next year
 
03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
does it give it extra as opposed to
 
03:15:43.030 --> 03:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll get to it we'll tell you
 
03:15:44.309 --> 03:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it
 
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's a law if it's as the
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
amendment says
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's something you must put a high on
 
03:15:51.670 --> 03:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
your priority list next year is that
 
03:15:54.150 --> 03:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
correct or not correct
 
03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
if we would work within the deadline we
 
03:15:56.239 --> 03:15:57.110 align:start position:0%
if we would work within the deadline we
have

03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:15:58.630 --> 03:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
there are so many quote unquote
 
03:16:02.550 --> 03:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
emergencies revolving pfs right now we
 
03:16:03.910 --> 03:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
have thousands of wells that are
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
exceeded exceeding we have a backlog of
 
03:16:08.150 --> 03:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
hundreds of wells to sample the harder
 
03:16:10.070 --> 03:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
we work the more work we have we'll get
 
03:16:11.269 --> 03:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
this done within the time frame we
 
03:16:12.630 --> 03:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
commit the way we would do it is
 
03:16:15.030 --> 03:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
integrated with our other initiatives so
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
if you have a daycare in center harbor
 
03:16:19.030 --> 03:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
while we're sampling contaminated homes
 
03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
in center harbor we do the daycare so
 
03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
we would work it in with all the other
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
very important priorities and just make
 
03:16:27.750 --> 03:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
it efficient as possible
 
03:16:29.190 --> 03:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
we'd integrate the work and that's what
 
03:16:30.550 --> 03:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
we do now
 
03:16:33.910 --> 03:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
follow on please follow us so um
 
03:16:36.389 --> 03:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
again the question was if we if this
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
becomes law
 
03:16:40.469 --> 03:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
you have to make it a priority do you
 
03:16:42.309 --> 03:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
have to make it a priority as opposed to
 
03:16:43.990 --> 03:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
working it with testing other houses in
 
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro or whatever
 
03:16:46.880 --> 03:16:47.990 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro or whatever
it

03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:16:49.910 --> 03:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
it would make it the same level priority
 
03:16:51.750 --> 03:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
because we have an obligation legally to
 
03:16:53.269 --> 03:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
address those contaminated wells in
 
03:16:55.110 --> 03:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
other communities so the priorities are
 
03:16:57.030 --> 03:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
equal identifying and eliminating
 
03:16:57.040 --> 03:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
equal identifying and eliminating
exposure

03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
03:17:02.469 --> 03:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:05.110 --> 03:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
what else for a question or a
 
03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:08.309 align:start position:0%
what else for a question or a

03:17:08.309 --> 03:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:10.950 --> 03:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at
 
03:17:17.269 --> 03:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:21.990 --> 03:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's it says that the school or licensed
 
03:17:24.389 --> 03:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
child care facility shall as an interim
 
03:17:26.229 --> 03:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
measure ensure that the children are
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
provided only drinking water that meets
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
the standard and it goes on to say that
 
03:17:34.389 --> 03:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
the school of licensed child care
 
03:17:36.630 --> 03:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
facilities shall also
 
03:17:39.590 --> 03:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
implement a remediation plan as approved
 
03:17:42.229 --> 03:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
by the department within 30 days of
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
notification of parents
 
03:17:47.110 --> 03:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
or in contra consultation with the
 
03:17:50.710 --> 03:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
department as soon as practically
 
03:17:52.830 --> 03:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
it was practical
 
03:17:55.590 --> 03:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah all right uh
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:59.920 --> 03:18:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:18:01.030 --> 03:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:03.429 --> 03:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
you said well they can just give the
 
03:18:03.439 --> 03:18:04.550 align:start position:0%
you said well they can just give the
kids

03:18:04.550 --> 03:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
kids
 
03:18:06.469 --> 03:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
drink and you know give the kids bottled
 
03:18:06.479 --> 03:18:08.469 align:start position:0%
drink and you know give the kids bottled
water

03:18:08.469 --> 03:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
water
 
03:18:08.479 --> 03:18:10.150 align:start position:0%
water
that's

03:18:10.150 --> 03:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:18:12.229 --> 03:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
that's not what the bill says the bill
 
03:18:14.630 --> 03:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
says it's got to be you know
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
i would i would love to see it say
 
03:18:19.590 --> 03:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
in lieu of this
 
03:18:21.830 --> 03:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
in lieu of all of these changes if you
 
03:18:23.670 --> 03:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
supply the kid's bottled water then
 
03:18:25.510 --> 03:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
you're covered
 
03:18:25.520 --> 03:18:26.870 align:start position:0%
you're covered
and

03:18:26.870 --> 03:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
even though it's a an interim that could
 
03:18:31.910 --> 03:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh at least as an interim and
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
probably as a
 
03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:34.830 align:start position:0%
probably as a
as

03:18:34.830 --> 03:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:18:36.150 --> 03:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
03:18:38.150 --> 03:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
as a as a
 
03:18:38.160 --> 03:18:40.710 align:start position:0%
as a as a
complete

03:18:40.710 --> 03:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:44.309 --> 03:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
perma as a permanent uh solution
 
03:18:45.429 --> 03:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
kids drink
 
03:18:48.070 --> 03:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
water and buy the bottled water
 
03:18:50.150 --> 03:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
but i'm not certain that this bill does
 
03:18:52.630 --> 03:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
this that's my biggest concern and i
 
03:18:55.670 --> 03:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to have this
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh steamroll into a larger into a costly
 
03:19:01.990 --> 03:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh item that it really doesn't have to
 
03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:04.309 align:start position:0%
uh item that it really doesn't have to
be

03:19:04.309 --> 03:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:19:05.910 --> 03:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
yeah you know mr chairman i mean
 
03:19:07.510 --> 03:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
certainly bottled water for the children
 
03:19:09.429 --> 03:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
is fine but they're not using bottled
 
03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
water to wash their hands if the
 
03:19:12.389 --> 03:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
facilities cooking meals they're
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
probably not using bottled water to cook
 
03:19:16.469 --> 03:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
some of the meals and that's where you
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
get into the problem is that if there's
 
03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
pfas in the water
 
03:19:22.229 --> 03:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
it talks about a remediation plan that
 
03:19:23.670 --> 03:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be put in place and they need
 
03:19:24.950 --> 03:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
to start working on getting it up it
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't say they have to do it overnight
 
03:19:29.030 --> 03:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
but it also says we're practical so they
 
03:19:31.190 --> 03:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
would be working with the department to
 
03:19:33.269 --> 03:19:33.279 align:start position:0%
come up with some sort of plan
 
03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
that they can put into place in a
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time to eliminate
 
03:19:40.150 --> 03:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
pfas or get it below the standards that
 
03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
are required um you know just saying
 
03:19:43.510 --> 03:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have bottled water and
 
03:19:44.550 --> 03:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
expect that they're gonna use bottled
 
03:19:45.910 --> 03:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
water to wash their hands that they're
 
03:19:47.190 --> 03:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
going to use bottled water to cook their
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
food that's
 
03:19:50.950 --> 03:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
kind of unreasonable and i don't think
 
03:19:52.150 --> 03:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
that that's something that some
 
03:19:53.830 --> 03:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
facilities would do i mean one of the
 
03:19:55.349 --> 03:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
reasons why this bill got put in is
 
03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
because there is a
 
03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
03:19:59.040 --> 03:20:01.110 align:start position:0%
lack of
of

03:20:01.110 --> 03:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:20:03.429 --> 03:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
basically compliance to make sure that
 
03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
all our children are in facilities
 
03:20:07.269 --> 03:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
particularly licensed facilities i mean
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
if we license them we're saying to the
 
03:20:10.469 --> 03:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
people who bring their kids there that
 
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
these are places that the state of new
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire feel are safe for their
 
03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
children to be at
 
03:20:18.790 --> 03:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
and the thing is is that we haven't been
 
03:20:20.150 --> 03:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're all safe
 
03:20:21.910 --> 03:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what the situation
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
is with with pfas i mean you you take a
 
03:20:26.229 --> 03:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
look at the reporting things about
 
03:20:28.389 --> 03:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
schools that are even the state website
 
03:20:29.990 --> 03:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
isn't up to date
 
03:20:31.750 --> 03:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
on some of the information on schools
 
03:20:33.990 --> 03:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
that are that have pfas in the water in
 
03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
schools they don't have pfas or art
 
03:20:36.550 --> 03:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
schools that have lead in their water
 
03:20:38.229 --> 03:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
and don't have light in the water i mean
 
03:20:39.750 --> 03:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
we need to get this information up to
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
date and maybe this bill goes a step
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
further than some people feel
 
03:20:45.110 --> 03:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable with because it requires
 
03:20:46.630 --> 03:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
that we provide a situation where our
 
03:20:48.630 --> 03:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
children are safe when you bring your
 
03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
child to a daycare center and it's they
 
03:20:52.229 --> 03:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
have a license hanging in their wall or
 
03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
a school that says that they are
 
03:20:56.309 --> 03:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
certified by the state of new hampshire
 
03:20:57.670 --> 03:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
they should meet the standards of the
 
03:20:59.670 --> 03:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and this is one
 
03:21:01.429 --> 03:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
way to do it this is one way to ensure
 
03:21:01.439 --> 03:21:05.990 align:start position:0%
way to do it this is one way to ensure
compliance

03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:08.710 --> 03:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
so out of the roughly 1500 entities we
 
03:21:11.670 --> 03:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
know the water meets standards or is on
 
03:21:14.469 --> 03:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
a path to meet standards for our mcl for
 
03:21:17.990 --> 03:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
p fest for 1 350 out of the 1500 in
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
round numbers so that remain gives you
 
03:21:23.910 --> 03:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
the remaining fifth 150 private wells
 
03:21:26.309 --> 03:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
which we propose to address
 
03:21:27.349 --> 03:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
using the
 
03:21:31.349 --> 03:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of these facilities probably don't
 
03:21:34.469 --> 03:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
cook but if they do that could be could
 
03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
be a concern washing hands dermal
 
03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
exposure isn't considered a risk right
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
now we don't recommend people use
 
03:21:41.910 --> 03:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
bottled water for washing
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
washing your hands i will say those 150
 
03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
entities that we have no data for it's
 
03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
because they're akin to a private well
 
03:21:50.469 --> 03:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
they're essentially like a household
 
03:21:52.150 --> 03:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
except they're watching kids and
 
03:21:52.160 --> 03:21:53.510 align:start position:0%
except they're watching kids and
unfortunately

03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
03:21:55.830 --> 03:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
until we have appropriate resources from
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
the responsible party which might take
 
03:21:59.030 --> 03:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
litigation and sample every well in the
 
03:21:59.040 --> 03:21:59.910 align:start position:0%
litigation and sample every well in the
state

03:21:59.910 --> 03:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:22:01.429 --> 03:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
our kids all over new hampshire probably
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
exposed to pfas right now because half
 
03:22:05.190 --> 03:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
the state's on a private well for which
 
03:22:05.200 --> 03:22:06.389 align:start position:0%
the state's on a private well for which
we

03:22:06.389 --> 03:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:22:08.389 --> 03:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
are trying to sample hot spot areas but
 
03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
you need to sample every well for pfas
 
03:22:11.349 --> 03:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
in the state to know if you're exposed
 
03:22:28.309 --> 03:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:29.990 --> 03:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
the camps are now with hhs i got moved a
 
03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
few years ago
 
03:22:37.349 --> 03:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
there are some requirements i know it's
 
03:22:38.950 --> 03:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
definitely like
 
03:22:41.110 --> 03:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
nitrate nitrite and bacteria
 
03:22:42.790 --> 03:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
for for the facilities and i'd have to
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
see what other parameters are required
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
but that's part of
 
03:22:47.990 --> 03:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
the licensing for the child care
 
03:23:01.429 --> 03:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:02.950 --> 03:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
i would prefer
 
03:23:05.429 --> 03:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
hhs to answer that it seems like it's an
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:10.950 --> 03:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
if you don't know enough and just call a
 
03:23:12.469 --> 03:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
couple places someone might charge you
 
03:23:14.630 --> 03:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
500 to sample for it if you know how to
 
03:23:15.510 --> 03:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
do it
 
03:23:16.950 --> 03:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
most efficiently it could be two hundred
 
03:23:18.550 --> 03:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
dollars so for these very small
 
03:23:25.389 --> 03:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:30.229 --> 03:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
03:23:34.950 --> 03:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if this is necessarily a
 
03:23:36.389 --> 03:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
question for you i'm just throwing this
 
03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
out there but you said
 
03:23:40.070 --> 03:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
you just said that you know it could be
 
03:23:42.550 --> 03:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
a 500 cost or it could be whatever so
 
03:23:43.830 --> 03:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that that means that the
 
03:23:46.870 --> 03:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
state does not pick up the tab for this
 
03:23:46.880 --> 03:23:48.150 align:start position:0%
state does not pick up the tab for this
under

03:23:48.150 --> 03:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:23:49.750 --> 03:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
well if
 
03:23:51.670 --> 03:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
that legislation went through
 
03:23:53.349 --> 03:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
the way it's worded is that the facility
 
03:23:55.110 --> 03:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
has to collect the sample des probably
 
03:23:57.510 --> 03:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
could go sample it
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
at least for the next year our funds
 
03:24:01.190 --> 03:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
won't be available after 18 months and
 
03:24:02.710 --> 03:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
so for the next two rounds after the
 
03:24:04.550 --> 03:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
first round and if that's still in the
 
03:24:06.070 --> 03:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
amendment three rounds of sampling the
 
03:24:07.750 --> 03:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
facility would have to pay the cost
 
03:24:10.870 --> 03:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
right and then and then follow up on
 
03:24:12.870 --> 03:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not so much uh concerned about the
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
idea of of the getting of the sample i'm
 
03:24:18.070 --> 03:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
more concerned about um
 
03:24:21.750 --> 03:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
as i've lost my thing here about
 
03:24:26.229 --> 03:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:27.429 --> 03:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
where they would have to come up with
 
03:24:27.439 --> 03:24:29.110 align:start position:0%
where they would have to come up with
remediation

03:24:29.110 --> 03:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
remediation
 
03:24:29.120 --> 03:24:30.550 align:start position:0%
remediation
um

03:24:30.550 --> 03:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:32.870 --> 03:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
theoretically what that would mean is is
 
03:24:34.630 --> 03:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
if they get it tested whoever does the
 
03:24:36.710 --> 03:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
testing then the next step would be if
 
03:24:39.110 --> 03:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
they was to be found then this this
 
03:24:41.910 --> 03:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
entity whether it's a a public school or
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
a private business is now going to be
 
03:24:46.389 --> 03:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
hit with with the money to to do the
 
03:24:49.429 --> 03:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
remediation to whatever that is and 28 a
 
03:24:51.269 --> 03:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
of our constitution says no unfunded
 
03:24:53.190 --> 03:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
mandates so
 
03:24:55.990 --> 03:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that if i'm reading that
 
03:24:56.000 --> 03:24:57.830 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that if i'm reading that
right

03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:25:06.830 --> 03:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
well the
 
03:25:12.469 --> 03:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
as far as a question uh
 
03:25:15.830 --> 03:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
a law is not a 28
 
03:25:18.870 --> 03:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's i think the 28a issue is
 
03:25:20.950 --> 03:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
whether something goes from this
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
state mandating something to the towns
 
03:25:26.070 --> 03:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not mistaken
 
03:25:27.510 --> 03:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
well your towns are in control of your
 
03:25:27.520 --> 03:25:28.389 align:start position:0%
well your towns are in control of your
schools

03:25:28.389 --> 03:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:25:28.399 --> 03:25:29.110 align:start position:0%
schools
that

03:25:29.110 --> 03:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
that is that could very well be that
 
03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
that is possible i'm just yeah i
 
03:25:37.190 --> 03:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:40.710 --> 03:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:44.710 --> 03:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here mr karen
 
03:25:47.279 --> 03:25:49.030 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here mr karen
um

03:25:49.030 --> 03:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:50.469 --> 03:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:25:52.229 --> 03:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:25:52.239 --> 03:25:53.429 align:start position:0%
the um
the

03:25:53.429 --> 03:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:57.190 --> 03:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
let me move this okay the amendment um
 
03:25:59.910 --> 03:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
talks about remediation
 
03:26:02.309 --> 03:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
and is there funding available state
 
03:26:05.670 --> 03:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
funding available for pfas remediation
 
03:26:07.510 --> 03:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
if it was d i mean what would be the
 
03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
next step after you found pfas in the
 
03:26:12.469 --> 03:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
drinking water at one of the schools
 
03:26:12.479 --> 03:26:13.349 align:start position:0%
drinking water at one of the schools
that

03:26:13.349 --> 03:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:26:16.830 --> 03:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:16.840 --> 03:26:18.389 align:start position:0%
 
presently

03:26:18.389 --> 03:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
presently
 
03:26:20.950 --> 03:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
so right now if we found
 
03:26:23.110 --> 03:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
pfas and private well with no viable
 
03:26:25.830 --> 03:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
responsible party
 
03:26:28.229 --> 03:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
we may provide bottled water temporarily
 
03:26:28.239 --> 03:26:29.269 align:start position:0%
we may provide bottled water temporarily
although

03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
although
 
03:26:30.630 --> 03:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
because we have thousands of private
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
wells that are contaminated that's
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
something less of an option
 
03:26:36.309 --> 03:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just even finding someone to buy the
 
03:26:38.389 --> 03:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
deliveries of bottled water
 
03:26:40.469 --> 03:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
it may be that the facility has to go
 
03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
ahead and expend its own funds put
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
treatment on we do have a small grant
 
03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
program to help school and child care
 
03:26:48.950 --> 03:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
facilities with the design cost of
 
03:26:50.630 --> 03:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
treatment which is about 26 percent of
 
03:26:52.229 --> 03:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
the cost which could be
 
03:26:53.590 --> 03:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
these small systems would probably be
 
03:26:55.510 --> 03:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
like about 5 000
 
03:26:55.520 --> 03:26:56.309 align:start position:0%
like about 5 000
so

03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:26:58.229 --> 03:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
but that's based on the availability of
 
03:27:00.309 --> 03:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
funding and the pfas funding is being
 
03:27:02.790 --> 03:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
utilized pretty swiftly so i'm not sure
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
as you get out in the second and third
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
rounds of sampling that funding would be
 
03:27:05.520 --> 03:27:06.630 align:start position:0%
rounds of sampling that funding would be
available

03:27:06.630 --> 03:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
a few years from now or 15 years from
 
03:27:08.399 --> 03:27:10.150 align:start position:0%
a few years from now or 15 years from
now

03:27:10.150 --> 03:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:27:10.160 --> 03:27:12.150 align:start position:0%
now
follow-up

03:27:12.150 --> 03:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:27:15.349 --> 03:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so in in your proposal which would
 
03:27:18.309 --> 03:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
eliminate the need for
 
03:27:21.190 --> 03:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
legislation at this point in time
 
03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:21.990 align:start position:0%
legislation at this point in time
um

03:27:21.990 --> 03:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:26.309 --> 03:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
and if des was finding pfas in the in
 
03:27:29.110 --> 03:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
the in the testing of those wells is
 
03:27:33.190 --> 03:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:34.870 --> 03:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
the entity would be notified that they
 
03:27:37.429 --> 03:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
are being exposed to unsafe levels and
 
03:27:37.439 --> 03:27:38.790 align:start position:0%
are being exposed to unsafe levels and
provided

03:27:38.790 --> 03:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
provided
 
03:27:41.429 --> 03:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
education on how to deal with that
 
03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
bottled water
 
03:27:44.469 --> 03:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
probably for the short term
 
03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
and some people especially smaller
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
facilities could use it for cooking
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
point of use treatment which would be a
 
03:27:51.670 --> 03:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
little filter and a separate tap on the
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
sink which
 
03:27:55.510 --> 03:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
would only be for drink potable water
 
03:27:56.950 --> 03:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
uses it could be used for
 
03:27:58.630 --> 03:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
cooking and it's 200 if you do it
 
03:28:00.229 --> 03:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
yourself a thousand dollars if you pay
 
03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
someone to do it or a whole facility
 
03:28:04.469 --> 03:28:04.479 align:start position:0%
treatment system which is about five
 
03:28:06.070 --> 03:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to treat every drop of
 
03:28:08.469 --> 03:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
water that's going into the building
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
and again
 
03:28:12.389 --> 03:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
we could fund about 26 of the costs
 
03:28:13.990 --> 03:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
until the funds are not available
 
03:28:14.000 --> 03:28:15.510 align:start position:0%
until the funds are not available
anymore

03:28:15.510 --> 03:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
03:28:17.590 --> 03:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
until the funds are not available anyway
 
03:28:20.469 --> 03:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
okay so it's a similar process once the
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
pfas is detected and whether the
 
03:28:26.790 --> 03:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
legislation happens or it doesn't happen
 
03:28:28.550 --> 03:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
well we would have no
 
03:28:31.429 --> 03:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
authority to force a private entity
 
03:28:33.269 --> 03:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's not a public water system to
 
03:28:34.950 --> 03:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
implement corrective action we would
 
03:28:36.790 --> 03:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
work really hard with these people just
 
03:28:39.510 --> 03:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
to educate them and make them aware of
 
03:28:41.190 --> 03:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
the availability of grants but we
 
03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:42.229 align:start position:0%
the availability of grants but we
couldn't

03:28:42.229 --> 03:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
03:28:44.070 --> 03:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
require that they mitigate the water
 
03:28:46.150 --> 03:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
quality as proposed in the bill
 
03:28:50.309 --> 03:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.870 --> 03:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:28:54.950 --> 03:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
you had just said a minute ago
 
03:28:56.469 --> 03:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
on remediation
 
03:28:58.229 --> 03:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
that they could put a small thing on
 
03:28:59.830 --> 03:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
their faucet or they could put a large
 
03:29:02.150 --> 03:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
system in there were options here are
 
03:29:04.790 --> 03:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
you saying that if you have pfas
 
03:29:06.630 --> 03:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
in your water there's something you can
 
03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
put on your faucet right now
 
03:29:09.120 --> 03:29:09.910 align:start position:0%
put on your faucet right now
to

03:29:09.910 --> 03:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:29:12.150 --> 03:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
pull out the pfas from your water that
 
03:29:13.750 --> 03:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
comes out of your faucet
 
03:29:13.760 --> 03:29:14.710 align:start position:0%
comes out of your faucet
so

03:29:14.710 --> 03:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:29:17.190 --> 03:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's called point of use and it's a
 
03:29:18.469 --> 03:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
technical term but it means you're
 
03:29:20.550 --> 03:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
treating water at a certain location
 
03:29:22.389 --> 03:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
only and that way it's a lot more
 
03:29:23.750 --> 03:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
efficient than treating things going
 
03:29:25.590 --> 03:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
through your sinks and showers and
 
03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
all that
 
03:29:30.309 --> 03:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
or not sinks out toilets and showers and
 
03:29:33.030 --> 03:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
so yes there you can put a carbon filter
 
03:29:34.950 --> 03:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
that essentially screws into the
 
03:29:36.630 --> 03:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
incoming water line and then into your
 
03:29:38.870 --> 03:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
cold water and it'll treat all the water
 
03:29:40.710 --> 03:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
coming out of your kitchen faucet that'd
 
03:29:43.750 --> 03:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
be a carbon filter only remove pfas
 
03:29:46.229 --> 03:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
another option is to put up you have
 
03:29:47.990 --> 03:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
some people like those little soap pumps
 
03:29:50.389 --> 03:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
next to the faucet you could drill a
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
hole in your sink or displace that soap
 
03:29:52.880 --> 03:29:53.910 align:start position:0%
hole in your sink or displace that soap
pump

03:29:53.910 --> 03:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
pump
 
03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
and put a second faucet that that has
 
03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
its own tap and that's being treated
 
03:30:00.790 --> 03:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
with reverse osmosis which takes not
 
03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
only pfas out but the arsenic and
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
uranium and nitrates and everything else
 
03:30:06.309 --> 03:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
that you're worried about and that's
 
03:30:08.790 --> 03:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
very cost effective you buy them 200 at
 
03:30:10.550 --> 03:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
the big box stores and professionals
 
03:30:12.550 --> 03:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
will put them in for about a thousand
 
03:30:14.550 --> 03:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
follow on please
 
03:30:16.870 --> 03:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm just following your logic here
 
03:30:19.110 --> 03:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm very familiar with the case of pfas
 
03:30:21.030 --> 03:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
contamination in this town of merrimack
 
03:30:23.830 --> 03:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm using it as an example
 
03:30:25.510 --> 03:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
why didn't the department give every
 
03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
resident that needed that
 
03:30:30.229 --> 03:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
that device as opposed to saint gerbain
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
had to pay for bottled water for all
 
03:30:33.750 --> 03:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
those residents it seems like that would
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
have been a simpler solution is there a
 
03:30:37.830 --> 03:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
reason why that didn't happen that way
 
03:30:40.630 --> 03:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
if it takes the pfas out
 
03:30:42.389 --> 03:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
so i was pretty involved with saint
 
03:30:44.070 --> 03:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
gobain and
 
03:30:45.990 --> 03:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
merrimack private wells and public wells
 
03:30:47.349 --> 03:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
up to a couple years ago so i can tell
 
03:30:48.630 --> 03:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
you what i know but i haven't been
 
03:30:50.070 --> 03:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
involved recently
 
03:30:51.990 --> 03:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
so initially and there's whole work
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
plans on this um that cinco bain did in
 
03:30:57.429 --> 03:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
fact put in point of entry and point of
 
03:30:57.439 --> 03:30:58.469 align:start position:0%
fact put in point of entry and point of
use

03:30:58.469 --> 03:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
systems in some of the initial homes
 
03:31:01.830 --> 03:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
that were contaminated
 
03:31:03.349 --> 03:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
it got so big so fast the number of
 
03:31:06.870 --> 03:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
wells that were contaminated all the
 
03:31:09.590 --> 03:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
while the water line extension started
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
occurring and being designed and so it
 
03:31:15.030 --> 03:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
became more logical to stop putting in
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
these filters when you were extending
 
03:31:18.389 --> 03:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
water lines because it was going to
 
03:31:20.950 --> 03:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
happen soon enough and so it just made
 
03:31:22.550 --> 03:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
sense to proceed that way to put the
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
resources towards
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
expediting the water line extension but
 
03:31:27.510 --> 03:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
again i haven't been that involved
 
03:31:29.349 --> 03:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
recently so okay thank you for the
 
03:31:29.359 --> 03:31:34.710 align:start position:0%
recently so okay thank you for the
answer

03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:37.830 --> 03:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question so
 
03:31:39.670 --> 03:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
my question is regarding public record
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
and transparency with your data sources
 
03:31:45.030 --> 03:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
if you're testing these 150 schools
 
03:31:46.790 --> 03:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
child care center wells where does that
 
03:31:48.790 --> 03:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
information go is it a matter of public
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
record can a parent go on to your
 
03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
website and say our school is at blah
 
03:31:56.229 --> 03:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
blah or is that is that not because to
 
03:31:58.469 --> 03:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
me that kind of peer pressure also helps
 
03:31:58.479 --> 03:31:59.269 align:start position:0%
me that kind of peer pressure also helps
in

03:31:59.269 --> 03:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:32:01.190 --> 03:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
in encouraging people
 
03:32:02.550 --> 03:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
to remediate because i'm certainly not
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
going to take my child to a school that
 
03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
has pfas levels that are through the
 
03:32:07.670 --> 03:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
roof if they're not remediating so is it
 
03:32:09.349 --> 03:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
a matter of public record i guess
 
03:32:11.750 --> 03:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
yes the data is ultimately available to
 
03:32:13.590 --> 03:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
the public you know we have data for
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
about 9 000 private wells and we choose
 
03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
not to make a table and put it online we
 
03:32:20.630 --> 03:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
have a viewer where you can look at an
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
app and look at results but you can't
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
get in close enough to get the exact
 
03:32:26.790 --> 03:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
location but ultimately if someone asks
 
03:32:29.110 --> 03:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
for data that we collected and have in
 
03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
our systems we have to give it so if
 
03:32:32.389 --> 03:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
they said i would need it for 10 smith
 
03:32:34.630 --> 03:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
street we would give that to them now
 
03:32:36.870 --> 03:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
these are businesses and this is a
 
03:32:38.550 --> 03:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
legislative initiative i could see a
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
scenario where we'd be comfortable with
 
03:32:42.469 --> 03:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
publishing a table of private well
 
03:32:42.479 --> 03:32:43.590 align:start position:0%
publishing a table of private well
results

03:32:43.590 --> 03:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
results
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
for child cares in schools private or
 
03:32:47.510 --> 03:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
public we already do that for public
 
03:32:49.349 --> 03:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
wells we submit a report twice a year to
 
03:32:51.349 --> 03:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature summarizing the pfast
 
03:32:51.359 --> 03:32:52.389 align:start position:0%
the legislature summarizing the pfast
results

03:32:52.389 --> 03:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
results
 
03:32:55.030 --> 03:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
and so those entities those schools and
 
03:32:56.710 --> 03:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
child care facilities that are regulated
 
03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
public water system and there's a couple
 
03:32:59.910 --> 03:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
hundred of them that data's online and
 
03:33:01.030 --> 03:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
available and submitted to the
 
03:33:01.040 --> 03:33:02.309 align:start position:0%
available and submitted to the
legislature

03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:33:03.910 --> 03:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
and you can submit a data request where
 
03:33:05.429 --> 03:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
we would just print it all out an excel
 
03:33:07.269 --> 03:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet for you as well for any
 
03:33:10.070 --> 03:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
given water system or town or whatever
 
03:33:11.510 --> 03:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
constraints you wanted to put around a
 
03:33:16.389 --> 03:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
so just in terms of expediency and i'm
 
03:33:19.429 --> 03:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
just thinking because i'm a resident
 
03:33:20.630 --> 03:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
mayor mack
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
how fast we can get this information
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's from what you're saying it's faster
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
if you we
 
03:33:31.269 --> 03:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
kind of move with your plan versus going
 
03:33:32.469 --> 03:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
through the legislator and going to the
 
03:33:33.750 --> 03:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
senate and then wait for the governor to
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
pass it or not and then
 
03:33:36.870 --> 03:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
agreeing that you'll move that forward
 
03:33:38.550 --> 03:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's some pieces in the legislation
 
03:33:38.560 --> 03:33:39.349 align:start position:0%
there's some pieces in the legislation
that

03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:33:40.710 --> 03:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
protect the public
 
03:33:44.150 --> 03:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
probably a little more expansively
 
03:33:45.750 --> 03:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
but the testing is really what i'm
 
03:33:47.030 --> 03:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
interested in because
 
03:33:48.309 --> 03:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
these people have got to stop being
 
03:33:50.550 --> 03:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
exposed to this stuff so do you agree
 
03:33:53.590 --> 03:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
that this is a faster way to do it
 
03:33:56.229 --> 03:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
i do um so what you give up is the
 
03:33:58.229 --> 03:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
enhanced public notification so like
 
03:34:00.469 --> 03:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
when merrimack had accedences they had
 
03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
to notify the public and probably most
 
03:34:03.910 --> 03:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the people i went to merrimack
 
03:34:03.920 --> 03:34:05.590 align:start position:0%
of the people i went to merrimack
schools

03:34:05.590 --> 03:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:34:08.309 --> 03:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
were on mvd water but not everyone but
 
03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
then what merrimack village district is
 
03:34:13.510 --> 03:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
required to do per state requirements is
 
03:34:16.309 --> 03:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
they're encouraged to notify the parents
 
03:34:18.389 --> 03:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
of the water quality issue but we don't
 
03:34:20.389 --> 03:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
enforce that we don't have a rate and
 
03:34:22.070 --> 03:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
that'd be a nightmare if we had to start
 
03:34:23.830 --> 03:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
tracking down
 
03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
three levels of notification to
 
03:34:27.590 --> 03:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
customers of water systems so you'd be
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
giving that up and also the requirement
 
03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
to mitigate if you were a private
 
03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
childcare facility but you're right you
 
03:34:35.910 --> 03:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
would get the full picture
 
03:34:37.670 --> 03:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
and then you could act
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
after you have all the data to see if
 
03:34:40.710 --> 03:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
you thought you needed legislation if
 
03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
you get if we come back to you and say
 
03:34:44.710 --> 03:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
they won't let a sample they won't fix
 
03:34:46.710 --> 03:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
though pfast problem they said it's they
 
03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
don't believe the science you know then
 
03:34:49.590 --> 03:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
you would know that maybe more
 
03:34:49.600 --> 03:34:50.870 align:start position:0%
you would know that maybe more
regulations

03:34:50.870 --> 03:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
03:34:53.510 --> 03:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh required at that point i will i did
 
03:34:55.269 --> 03:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
want to point out and it's a little off
 
03:34:57.510 --> 03:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
topic but it's all going to get tangled
 
03:35:00.229 --> 03:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
together ultimately this bill is kind of
 
03:35:02.309 --> 03:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
modeled off the lead in school
 
03:35:03.750 --> 03:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and there's a house bill
 
03:35:07.190 --> 03:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
1421 and senate bill 452 that are all
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
increasing testing and notification
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
requirements and mitigation requirements
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
responsibilities ds
 
03:35:14.309 --> 03:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
when you put these things together it's
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
going to get really complicated too and
 
03:35:19.429 --> 03:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
so and costly i mean we can't absorb it
 
03:35:20.790 --> 03:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
we need all
 
03:35:22.870 --> 03:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
the way we do what i said before tell
 
03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
people a sample get the data react to
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
the data mitigate the water track that
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
get another sample and then track future
 
03:35:30.870 --> 03:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
sampling and track public notification
 
03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
is all through databases you cannot do
 
03:35:35.190 --> 03:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
that manually especially at 1500
 
03:35:35.200 --> 03:35:36.389 align:start position:0%
that manually especially at 1500
entities

03:35:36.389 --> 03:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
entities
 
03:35:36.399 --> 03:35:37.510 align:start position:0%
entities
and

03:35:37.510 --> 03:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:38.550 --> 03:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:35:40.389 --> 03:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
it's just gonna it's gonna it's creating
 
03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
a whole new regulatory program at des
 
03:35:43.830 --> 03:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately and i'm not
 
03:35:45.110 --> 03:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to tell you how it is we
 
03:35:47.429 --> 03:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
won't be done well if we don't staff it
 
03:35:48.870 --> 03:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
the way we staff our drinking water
 
03:35:50.630 --> 03:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
program because you just don't do this
 
03:35:52.550 --> 03:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
one by one the data flows in
 
03:35:54.469 --> 03:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
electronically and flows out
 
03:35:55.750 --> 03:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
and people get mad at our letters
 
03:35:57.269 --> 03:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
because often the computer's behind the
 
03:35:59.429 --> 03:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
letter based on a logarithm you know so
 
03:36:01.110 --> 03:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's just the way you have to do things
 
03:36:06.150 --> 03:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:07.190 --> 03:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think he
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
answered my question though based on
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
when he answered the last question
 
03:36:11.349 --> 03:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
because the concern i had was the
 
03:36:12.950 --> 03:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
notification of parents
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
in the bill it requires that the parents
 
03:36:16.150 --> 03:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
be notified of the positive tests within
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
five days you're saying that if you find
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
a positive test you'll tell the facility
 
03:36:21.429 --> 03:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
but there is no requirement for anybody
 
03:36:23.590 --> 03:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
to notify the parents
 
03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct uh i mean i think a
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
school system and a school board would
 
03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
be pretty unhappy with administration if
 
03:36:31.349 --> 03:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
they did not
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
follow that advice and warn about water
 
03:36:34.469 --> 03:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
quality and there's a
 
03:36:35.830 --> 03:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
political process to make sure you have
 
03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
the right people representing the school
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
system to see those things through but
 
03:36:39.670 --> 03:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately someone could make that
 
03:36:41.349 --> 03:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
decision that no i'm not going to tell
 
03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
them you just just just follow up um you
 
03:36:44.790 --> 03:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
know it doesn't understand there are
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
only 150 of these schools and it's so
 
03:36:48.630 --> 03:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's probably not a lot of public
 
03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
schools but there are larger daycares uh
 
03:36:52.710 --> 03:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
preschools that are out there private
 
03:36:54.790 --> 03:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
facilities more than anything else that
 
03:36:56.469 --> 03:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with i know of a private
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
facility up in wakefield it's got 50
 
03:36:59.349 --> 03:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
kids in it
 
03:37:02.550 --> 03:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
um and and it's on a well and i don't
 
03:37:03.750 --> 03:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
know if they've tested their water or
 
03:37:05.750 --> 03:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
not they would i would hope they had
 
03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
more than 25 people six months of the
 
03:37:10.389 --> 03:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
year has to be uh non-transient so it's
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
the smaller ones that a parent who may
 
03:37:14.469 --> 03:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
have not have a lot of options for child
 
03:37:14.479 --> 03:37:15.429 align:start position:0%
have not have a lot of options for child
care

03:37:15.429 --> 03:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:37:17.830 --> 03:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
is finds out you know that they get
 
03:37:19.830 --> 03:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
tested the facility is tested positive
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the parent may not know
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
and if they did know they may be able to
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
make another choice but if they don't
 
03:37:26.309 --> 03:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
know when nobody wants to tell them
 
03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
because the person's saying god if i
 
03:37:28.389 --> 03:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
tell my parents they're all going to
 
03:37:30.389 --> 03:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
leave me and i'm going to be broke what
 
03:37:32.309 --> 03:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
do i do and i won't tell my parents
 
03:37:32.319 --> 03:37:33.269 align:start position:0%
do i do and i won't tell my parents
that's

03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:37:34.710 --> 03:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
this bill would require that that be
 
03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
done and somebody would verify that had
 
03:37:50.309 --> 03:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:53.190 --> 03:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i just um wanted to ask mr
 
03:37:53.200 --> 03:37:54.229 align:start position:0%
thank you i just um wanted to ask mr
kernan

03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
kernan
 
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
um i see that um new hampshire des has a
 
03:38:01.510 --> 03:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
great gis website with a lot of sampling
 
03:38:03.990 --> 03:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
data for the whole state
 
03:38:05.990 --> 03:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
um which is available on the on the
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
website easily found
 
03:38:10.790 --> 03:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
through a google search and
 
03:38:12.630 --> 03:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's broken down into three different
 
03:38:14.309 --> 03:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
categories like
 
03:38:14.319 --> 03:38:15.910 align:start position:0%
categories like
um

03:38:15.910 --> 03:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
below 70 parts per trillion and
 
03:38:19.680 --> 03:38:20.870 align:start position:0%
below 70 parts per trillion and
um

03:38:20.870 --> 03:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
could you could you speak a little bit
 
03:38:24.389 --> 03:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
about that are parents using this i mean
 
03:38:25.830 --> 03:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
i assume that if
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
in the higher uh the communities that
 
03:38:29.670 --> 03:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
have more hits
 
03:38:31.990 --> 03:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
at this website i mean should be a great
 
03:38:34.469 --> 03:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
resource for them thank you yes um
 
03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
people are using it
 
03:38:38.790 --> 03:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
it alleviated a lot of requests for
 
03:38:40.389 --> 03:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
information about pfast by just putting
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
it all out there and
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
that website feeds directly from our
 
03:38:46.870 --> 03:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
databases so as the lab reports data for
 
03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
private or public wells into our
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
database and they do it electronically
 
03:38:55.510 --> 03:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
that once a week refreshes that map
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
the thing we've done on that map we have
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
an internal version that shows you
 
03:39:01.189 --> 03:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
everything right down to the
 
03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
the name of the person and the address
 
03:39:05.110 --> 03:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
but the external version
 
03:39:06.950 --> 03:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
blocks that out and if you try to zoom
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
into an actual home it'll gray out but
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
you can certainly at a neighborhood
 
03:39:12.309 --> 03:39:12.319 align:start position:0%
level see results and if you only have
 
03:39:13.670 --> 03:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
one building
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
out in a rural area you'll be able to
 
03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
figure out whose result it was pretty
 
03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
easily just one step it's trying to give
 
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
people information they can follow up
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
and request for the specific data for a
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
specific neighborhood but just not
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
trying to put too much personal
 
03:39:26.950 --> 03:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
information out there unless people
 
03:39:28.710 --> 03:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
really need to take that extra effort to
 
03:39:32.630 --> 03:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:32.640 --> 03:39:35.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:39:35.349 --> 03:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:38.070 --> 03:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
okay that being from merrimack
 
03:39:40.469 --> 03:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
i the one thing i do want to add is
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
you can also exempt the schools that
 
03:39:44.710 --> 03:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
have put already put filtration systems
 
03:39:47.670 --> 03:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
in merrimack every school has been done
 
03:39:49.510 --> 03:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
cost of six million dollars it was the
 
03:39:52.389 --> 03:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that got hit with that bill
 
03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
so that's what i'm saying when you're
 
03:39:56.070 --> 03:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with these things the the 70 per
 
03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
trillion is the epa
 
03:39:57.840 --> 03:39:58.870 align:start position:0%
trillion is the epa
minimum

03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
03:40:00.389 --> 03:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's now is 12 to 18
 
03:40:01.990 --> 03:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
depending on what it is
 
03:40:02.000 --> 03:40:03.429 align:start position:0%
depending on what it is
so

03:40:03.429 --> 03:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
on when any whenever you're dealing with
 
03:40:07.030 --> 03:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
these schools like this though you
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
you've got to realize that
 
03:40:10.070 --> 03:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
when we
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
when they brought that you brought that
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
to the town the town made the decision
 
03:40:17.429 --> 03:40:17.439 align:start position:0%
to do to filter schools
 
03:40:19.510 --> 03:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
we weren't going to get any money and so
 
03:40:21.030 --> 03:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
the thing that they're you know the
 
03:40:23.110 --> 03:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
schools are looking for now is how do we
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
get recourse in the long run so that's
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
and hopefully so that's going to eat a
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more money if that ends up
 
03:40:38.870 --> 03:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:41.510 --> 03:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'm still full full of fog here i mean
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
what do we do
 
03:40:45.670 --> 03:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
do we move forward with the bill or you
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
have here a
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
a proposal in lieu of the bill
 
03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
that would give you
 
03:40:55.269 --> 03:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
a data summary in a year
 
03:40:56.950 --> 03:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
to see
 
03:40:59.510 --> 03:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
what that nature of the problem is and
 
03:41:03.429 --> 03:41:03.439 align:start position:0%
the proper remedy for it okay
 
03:41:03.439 --> 03:41:04.309 align:start position:0%
the proper remedy for it okay
and

03:41:04.309 --> 03:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
we're trying to shake out i test what
 
03:41:08.870 --> 03:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
the bill gives
 
03:41:10.389 --> 03:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
and what
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
this gives and
 
03:41:12.960 --> 03:41:15.269 align:start position:0%
this gives and
is is

03:41:15.269 --> 03:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
is is
 
03:41:17.429 --> 03:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
you know the bill is stronger but it has
 
03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
03:41:21.269 --> 03:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
stronger things in it
 
03:41:21.279 --> 03:41:22.630 align:start position:0%
stronger things in it
that

03:41:22.630 --> 03:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
some of us might find
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
not palatable your
 
03:41:30.070 --> 03:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
your uh
 
03:41:32.229 --> 03:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong this is just my
 
03:41:33.670 --> 03:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
what i'm seeing
 
03:41:34.710 --> 03:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
but your
 
03:41:37.110 --> 03:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
your sis
 
03:41:37.120 --> 03:41:38.870 align:start position:0%
your sis
is

03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
more palatable because
 
03:41:44.790 --> 03:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
but it's not intrusive
 
03:41:46.870 --> 03:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
and you're paying for it right it won't
 
03:41:48.790 --> 03:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
have to go to fiscal or finance what
 
03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
does it the question is does it give
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
03:41:54.870 --> 03:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
what do we end up with
 
03:41:57.429 --> 03:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
once it's over and do we then
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
03:42:02.150 --> 03:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
is it you know is it one or the other or
 
03:42:02.160 --> 03:42:03.189 align:start position:0%
is it you know is it one or the other or
both

03:42:03.189 --> 03:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
both
 
03:42:03.199 --> 03:42:04.469 align:start position:0%
both
so

03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
where where are we going on this
 
03:42:07.120 --> 03:42:08.150 align:start position:0%
where where are we going on this
um

03:42:08.150 --> 03:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:09.910 --> 03:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you where i'm going but i
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
won't tell you i won't tell you where
 
03:42:12.870 --> 03:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going because i don't want to weigh
 
03:42:14.469 --> 03:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
the you know this
 
03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:42:15.439 --> 03:42:16.630 align:start position:0%
this is
one

03:42:16.630 --> 03:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm well one person among 20 i'm 21. so
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
had another thought
 
03:42:25.590 --> 03:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
you said there's 150 schools in child
 
03:42:26.790 --> 03:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
care facilities and i always think of
 
03:42:28.710 --> 03:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
schools as being under public control
 
03:42:30.469 --> 03:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
under the town control and child care
 
03:42:33.189 --> 03:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
facilities as being private is there is
 
03:42:34.630 --> 03:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
there differentiation between how many
 
03:42:36.550 --> 03:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
of those 150 are actually schools and
 
03:42:38.630 --> 03:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
how many are child care facilities
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
i believe it's about a 50 schools and
 
03:42:43.750 --> 03:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of privately owned for our
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
non-profit schools that the towns aren't
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
associated with say it again
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
i said there's a
 
03:42:53.590 --> 03:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's about 50 small either non-profit
 
03:42:55.590 --> 03:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
or for-profit small schools that don't
 
03:43:01.750 --> 03:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
representative perez and representative
 
03:43:05.110 --> 03:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
post thank you
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
um my only concern
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm here helping with the
 
03:43:11.590 --> 03:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
committee but i i do have a little bit
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
of concern like um
 
03:43:17.189 --> 03:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
will you proposal the school
 
03:43:21.670 --> 03:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
up not gonna be um forced to
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
let the parents know
 
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
yeah you can talk to the schools but
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a lot that is going
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
to force the school
 
03:43:32.150 --> 03:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
to provide that to the parents
 
03:43:34.150 --> 03:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
and then to be honest for what i'm
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
seeing in my town we we we've been
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
having a lot of issues with water
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
contamination we get keep getting brown
 
03:43:41.429 --> 03:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
water like
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
almost black water
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
and they keep telling us keep let the
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
water run let the water run
 
03:43:49.030 --> 03:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
we don't know how many of these
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
children's in our town because you know
 
03:43:53.510 --> 03:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
some parents that work all the time they
 
03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
drink in that contaminated water so
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
i'm a little concerned that's the only
 
03:43:59.269 --> 03:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
thing that i'm a little concerned they
 
03:44:02.150 --> 03:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
have you know if with your proposal that
 
03:44:04.950 --> 03:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be a way yes you can
 
03:44:06.790 --> 03:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
talk to them but it's not going to be
 
03:44:09.349 --> 03:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement for them to
 
03:44:11.990 --> 03:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
send the report to the parents and then
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
with all that you know the issues that
 
03:44:15.750 --> 03:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
we have with water contamination i'm a
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
little concerned you know we got to
 
03:44:20.469 --> 03:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
think about the future of our kids you
 
03:44:22.229 --> 03:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
know the next generation
 
03:44:23.590 --> 03:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know this can cause
 
03:44:27.189 --> 03:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
you know other issues
 
03:44:31.269 --> 03:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's my only concern
 
03:44:33.750 --> 03:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
so i mean that's a key part of the safe
 
03:44:35.590 --> 03:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
drinking water act that we administer is
 
03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure people are notified of
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
exposure so to the extent you have an
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
uncooperative entity um
 
03:44:45.189 --> 03:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that is a concern i i don't tend to
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
find that to be frequent there are those
 
03:44:49.349 --> 03:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
that out there that just think
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
all you know our science is just not
 
03:44:52.710 --> 03:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
worth anything and therefore they're not
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
gonna tell anybody but that few and far
 
03:44:54.640 --> 03:44:55.830 align:start position:0%
gonna tell anybody but that few and far
between

03:44:55.830 --> 03:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:44:58.150 --> 03:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
um but there could be that scenario and
 
03:44:59.349 --> 03:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
the way i look at this is not walking
 
03:45:03.750 --> 03:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
away from requiring notifications
 
03:45:06.150 --> 03:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
sometime in the future it just gives you
 
03:45:09.269 --> 03:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
a more complete picture within a year of
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
what's happening out there and then you
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
can decide the nature of future sampling
 
03:45:16.150 --> 03:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
or notification requirements but
 
03:45:17.349 --> 03:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
your concern
 
03:45:18.389 --> 03:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
in very
 
03:45:21.189 --> 03:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
rare circumstances could occur
 
03:45:23.590 --> 03:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative kelly
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair oh i'm sorry
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative post
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
i didn't i didn't ever i didn't have a
 
03:45:32.870 --> 03:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
written down
 
03:45:35.429 --> 03:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
work session thank you i'm too lazy
 
03:45:37.990 --> 03:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for yielding to me um
 
03:45:42.150 --> 03:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
so earlier you talked about a um
 
03:45:44.309 --> 03:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
the ability for people to go online and
 
03:45:44.319 --> 03:45:45.189 align:start position:0%
the ability for people to go online and
see

03:45:45.189 --> 03:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
um who was tested and things like that
 
03:45:49.349 --> 03:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
you already had that and you said it's
 
03:45:52.070 --> 03:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
open to the public to look at
 
03:45:54.469 --> 03:45:54.479 align:start position:0%
we have the data available
 
03:45:56.389 --> 03:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
a few different ways first this viewer
 
03:45:57.910 --> 03:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
which is more like a general
 
03:45:59.429 --> 03:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
neighborhood scale you can look for
 
03:45:59.439 --> 03:46:01.110 align:start position:0%
neighborhood scale you can look for
results

03:46:01.110 --> 03:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
results
 
03:46:05.429 --> 03:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
then we issue for public water systems
 
03:46:07.429 --> 03:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
we issue a legislative report twice a
 
03:46:09.110 --> 03:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
year where we summarize the pfast
 
03:46:10.870 --> 03:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
results for all public water systems
 
03:46:12.870 --> 03:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
that have to test for pfas all 1200 of
 
03:46:12.880 --> 03:46:13.590 align:start position:0%
that have to test for pfas all 1200 of
them

03:46:13.590 --> 03:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
and that's online
 
03:46:17.349 --> 03:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
and then we have
 
03:46:19.750 --> 03:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
our one-stop data files our waste sites
 
03:46:21.429 --> 03:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
where any private well it's testing
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
around a given
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
active contamination site you can look
 
03:46:26.309 --> 03:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
up the results it requires some work
 
03:46:27.750 --> 03:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
going through reports and things like
 
03:46:27.760 --> 03:46:29.110 align:start position:0%
going through reports and things like
that

03:46:29.110 --> 03:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:46:30.309 --> 03:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
we could
 
03:46:31.349 --> 03:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
commit to
 
03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
developing a report that summarizes this
 
03:46:35.670 --> 03:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
sampling and
 
03:46:37.189 --> 03:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
you know i would have to ask for senior
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
leadership but i don't see why health
 
03:46:40.950 --> 03:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
and human services too in department of
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
ed because again we don't have
 
03:46:43.590 --> 03:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
relationships with these schools in
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
daycare for the most part to make sure
 
03:46:46.229 --> 03:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
that they don't have any problems with
 
03:46:47.910 --> 03:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
putting a summary of results for those
 
03:46:49.349 --> 03:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
entities online
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
seems like it would make sense to me but
 
03:46:52.950 --> 03:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
i need to make sure those other agencies
 
03:46:55.189 --> 03:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
aren't aware of some issues that i'm not
 
03:46:55.199 --> 03:46:56.150 align:start position:0%
aren't aware of some issues that i'm not
okay

03:46:56.150 --> 03:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
and then just
 
03:47:00.389 --> 03:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
as a as a thought i know
 
03:47:02.469 --> 03:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
for our school district
 
03:47:04.710 --> 03:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
board members alternately take turns
 
03:47:07.750 --> 03:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
going in to check what is being paid out
 
03:47:07.760 --> 03:47:08.469 align:start position:0%
going in to check what is being paid out
so

03:47:08.469 --> 03:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:47:11.590 --> 03:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
if we're paying for a test to be done
 
03:47:14.309 --> 03:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming more than just someone at
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
the school it would be a board member
 
03:47:20.389 --> 03:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
that would look at that and approve that
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
payment out so i don't i don't think
 
03:47:25.750 --> 03:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
there would be as much of a fear because
 
03:47:28.229 --> 03:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
there is oversight it's not like it
 
03:47:30.229 --> 03:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
would go to one single person it's
 
03:47:32.710 --> 03:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
reviewed by several so
 
03:47:35.670 --> 03:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
but if if it could be posted
 
03:47:37.990 --> 03:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
i mean that way everybody could look it
 
03:47:39.910 --> 03:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
up right
 
03:47:41.349 --> 03:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
yes i think we
 
03:47:43.910 --> 03:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
we could post it i just need to check
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
with our management and the other
 
03:47:47.670 --> 03:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
agencies that have more direct control
 
03:47:49.110 --> 03:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
over these entities to make sure they're
 
03:47:51.030 --> 03:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
not aware of an issue i'm not
 
03:47:53.349 --> 03:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
but we post this kind of data for the
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
child care facilities and schools that
 
03:47:56.229 --> 03:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
have their own wells already and that
 
03:47:57.750 --> 03:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
are big enough to be a regulated system
 
03:47:59.590 --> 03:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
that data's already online so i don't
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
see why the smaller ones couldn't be
 
03:48:01.040 --> 03:48:05.910 align:start position:0%
see why the smaller ones couldn't be
either

03:48:05.910 --> 03:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:07.990 --> 03:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to get to this uh i've got
 
03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative kelly
 
03:48:13.110 --> 03:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'll let you follow up but then i i then
 
03:48:16.309 --> 03:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
i want to get this taken care of
 
03:48:16.319 --> 03:48:17.990 align:start position:0%
i want to get this taken care of
um

03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:21.349 --> 03:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
i i wanted to ask about the osmosis and
 
03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
the carbon filter are those proven to
 
03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:24.950 align:start position:0%
the carbon filter are those proven to
have

03:48:24.950 --> 03:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:48:24.960 --> 03:48:26.309 align:start position:0%
have
remediate

03:48:26.309 --> 03:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
remediate
 
03:48:27.750 --> 03:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
the pfas
 
03:48:30.630 --> 03:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
yes um epa has studied a lot of the
 
03:48:30.640 --> 03:48:31.990 align:start position:0%
yes um epa has studied a lot of the
major

03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
major
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
treatment units that are sold out there
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
and then there's also a certification
 
03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
process that's not quite
 
03:48:40.550 --> 03:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
good enough for drds's standards they
 
03:48:43.429 --> 03:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
don't certified at epa's original value
 
03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
but our testing has shown carbon and
 
03:48:47.110 --> 03:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
reverse osmosis works and we have that
 
03:48:48.630 --> 03:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
data all over the state for both the
 
03:48:49.990 --> 03:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
initial wells and merrimack and
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
litchfield that we had treatment systems
 
03:48:52.469 --> 03:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
put in
 
03:48:54.870 --> 03:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
we had the pre and post sample results
 
03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
over time and now we have dozens of
 
03:48:59.910 --> 03:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
larger water systems with carbon units
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
that can't really use reverse osmosis
 
03:49:03.189 --> 03:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
because you waste three gallons for
 
03:49:05.030 --> 03:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
every one gallon of water
 
03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
with that process and it's it's very
 
03:49:08.870 --> 03:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
effective of removing the contaminants
 
03:49:11.910 --> 03:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
we regulate some of the newer pfas
 
03:49:13.830 --> 03:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
compounds for which we have limited
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
toxicity data they're called smaller
 
03:49:15.600 --> 03:49:16.389 align:start position:0%
toxicity data they're called smaller
chain

03:49:16.389 --> 03:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
chain
 
03:49:18.150 --> 03:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
they're removed at first but over
 
03:49:19.830 --> 03:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
several months you'll start seeing very
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
low levels of things like pfda coming in
 
03:49:25.110 --> 03:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
pfbs breaking through
 
03:49:26.710 --> 03:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
right now it looks like the toxic
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
profile of those isn't as significant as
 
03:49:31.349 --> 03:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
pfoa and pfos but the science is still
 
03:49:34.469 --> 03:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative kelly for a question
 
03:49:38.469 --> 03:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my question was
 
03:49:39.990 --> 03:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
mainly answered by representative post
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
question it was about it seems like the
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
the crux of many people
 
03:49:46.150 --> 03:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
not wanting to delay for you know future
 
03:49:47.590 --> 03:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
testing is that we
 
03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:49:50.229 --> 03:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
notification of parents not being
 
03:49:50.239 --> 03:49:51.510 align:start position:0%
notification of parents not being
mandatory

03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
03:49:54.150 --> 03:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
the and i was going to just ask if we if
 
03:49:56.710 --> 03:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
there's if we're able to see that data
 
03:49:58.870 --> 03:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
that you collect on those 150 smaller
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
entities in a concise format then if
 
03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
there is a number you know 75 who don't
 
03:50:07.349 --> 03:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
want to report the data out in 75 or
 
03:50:09.189 --> 03:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
above the limit some crazy
 
03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
reason that we would as a body be able
 
03:50:11.680 --> 03:50:12.710 align:start position:0%
reason that we would as a body be able
to

03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:50:14.630 --> 03:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
see the data and then and then report
 
03:50:15.910 --> 03:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
out to our constituents i don't know if
 
03:50:17.349 --> 03:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
that's something that's allowed but you
 
03:50:18.550 --> 03:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much ask said it's going to be
 
03:50:20.710 --> 03:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
hhs that needs to answer that yeah i
 
03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
mean the data in our hands is available
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of what we put out on our
 
03:50:27.030 --> 03:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
website and again i think we could put
 
03:50:28.550 --> 03:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
the table out on the website i just need
 
03:50:28.560 --> 03:50:29.349 align:start position:0%
the table out on the website i just need
to

03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:50:31.110 --> 03:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
be respectful of the other agencies that
 
03:50:33.269 --> 03:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
actually licenses those institutions to
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
make sure they're not aware of something
 
03:50:37.110 --> 03:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
but the data in our database could be
 
03:50:39.189 --> 03:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
handed over to you or anybody on the
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
street and
 
03:50:42.309 --> 03:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
they can do press releases mailing
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
whatever they want that happens every
 
03:50:43.680 --> 03:50:44.870 align:start position:0%
whatever they want that happens every
day

03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay i want to get this to get this
 
03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
taken care of uh i'm gonna take uh this
 
03:50:53.189 --> 03:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
is work session so uh you don't even
 
03:50:56.309 --> 03:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
have we i'm just gonna take consensus
 
03:50:59.750 --> 03:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
we have

will be how many would like to move
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%

five roughly
 
03:52:04.150 --> 03:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
all right on the
 
03:52:07.349 --> 03:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
that's on the bill on the proposal
 
03:52:10.830 --> 03:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
how many would like to work on
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
it think people would like to work on
 
03:52:16.710 --> 03:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:17.990 --> 03:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
what do we want
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
what do we want on the out of the
 
03:52:19.920 --> 03:52:22.950 align:start position:0%
what do we want on the out of the
proposal

03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.269 --> 03:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
he's gonna you're just gonna do it
 
03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:28.800 --> 03:52:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
you want us to write a letter or you
 
03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
will write a letter
 
03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:38.790 --> 03:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
you would like to
 
03:52:38.800 --> 03:52:41.590 align:start position:0%
you would like to
okay

03:52:41.590 --> 03:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:52:43.189 --> 03:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
represent perez
 
03:52:46.150 --> 03:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
the only thing that i i we added is
 
03:52:49.030 --> 03:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
um yes and you know the report is
 
03:52:52.150 --> 03:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
available online but um i would like to
 
03:52:54.790 --> 03:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
see that report available for the rural
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
areas where parents don't have access to
 
03:52:58.870 --> 03:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
computers or they don't have access to
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
the information yes we we we're talking
 
03:53:01.439 --> 03:53:02.630 align:start position:0%
the information yes we we we're talking
about

03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:53:04.710 --> 03:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
the whole state we're not just talking
 
03:53:06.550 --> 03:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
about the areas you know with with the
 
03:53:08.550 --> 03:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
parents they have the flexibility to see
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
the reports on the computer so how how
 
03:53:13.189 --> 03:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
are we going to handle that part because
 
03:53:16.150 --> 03:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
like i said you know i i
 
03:53:18.070 --> 03:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know i represent a town but you know
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
in in my time we have areas that rural
 
03:53:22.150 --> 03:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
areas and and i know some other
 
03:53:24.469 --> 03:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
representatives represent rural areas
 
03:53:26.790 --> 03:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
how the parents going to have access if
 
03:53:28.150 --> 03:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
they don't have internet or they don't
 
03:53:34.830 --> 03:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
library right
 
03:53:38.950 --> 03:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:53:38.960 --> 03:53:39.750 align:start position:0%
all right
uh

03:53:39.750 --> 03:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:53:41.429 --> 03:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we answered that yeah
 
03:53:43.269 --> 03:53:43.279 align:start position:0%
mr chairman certainly i'll be happy to
 
03:53:44.389 --> 03:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
talk to represent perez about that
 
03:53:45.990 --> 03:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
because i do have some concerns i mean
 
03:53:48.309 --> 03:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
some of the data on the des website is
 
03:53:50.550 --> 03:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
not up to date as well i know in
 
03:53:51.510 --> 03:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
rochester all the schools have been
 
03:53:53.189 --> 03:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
tested for lead yet only half of them
 
03:53:55.269 --> 03:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
show us being cleared and some of them
 
03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
are still showing high lead standards
 
03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
and they're not but
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
my recommendation would be and if the
 
03:54:01.990 --> 03:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
committee would agree to it is that we
 
03:54:03.910 --> 03:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
send this an interim study he says he's
 
03:54:05.349 --> 03:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
going to be getting stuff to us within
 
03:54:07.750 --> 03:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
the next 12 months or so and if we could
 
03:54:09.750 --> 03:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh hold this and in the fall if we
 
03:54:11.590 --> 03:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten what we're looking for
 
03:54:13.590 --> 03:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
then we move ahead with the we resubmit
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
the bill and if not
 
03:54:17.670 --> 03:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
we we let the bill go if they've come up
 
03:54:19.590 --> 03:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
with you know if they're making
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
substantial progress on this issue
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
because i think we all want to see
 
03:54:24.790 --> 03:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
progress on this issue and we also want
 
03:54:26.710 --> 03:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
to see some way that maybe
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
they may be able to come up with
 
03:54:29.429 --> 03:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
something or maybe we have to have a
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
bill that that deals with just parental
 
03:54:31.199 --> 03:54:32.469 align:start position:0%
bill that that deals with just parental
notification

03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
notification
 
03:54:34.150 --> 03:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
but it's it's something we can pick that
 
03:54:35.510 --> 03:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
up at that time and so we send it to
 
03:54:37.429 --> 03:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
interim study we can work on it in the
 
03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
fall and uh take a look at what des has
 
03:54:41.910 --> 03:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
available meet again and and then move
 
03:54:43.590 --> 03:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
forward from that point and i would be i
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
would be happy with that
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i think
 
03:54:51.990 --> 03:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:54.550 --> 03:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
i appreciate i appreciate your
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
your insight
 
03:54:57.750 --> 03:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
03:54:59.670 --> 03:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
think we're going i'm going go move now
 
03:55:02.229 --> 03:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
into executive session
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
where we will
 
03:55:07.510 --> 03:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i will entertain a motion uh
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
to uh for interim study
 
03:55:13.429 --> 03:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
of this bill is is that is that
 
03:55:13.439 --> 03:55:14.950 align:start position:0%
of this bill is is that is that
sufficient

03:55:14.950 --> 03:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
03:55:15.990 --> 03:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to enter into
 
03:55:18.150 --> 03:55:18.160 align:start position:0%

for some stuff
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
enter executive session
 
03:55:29.910 --> 03:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
03:55:29.920 --> 03:55:33.269 align:start position:0%
on house bill
1602

03:55:33.269 --> 03:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:36.550 --> 03:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
and do i have a motion
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative smith oh oh shoot i
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:56.630 --> 03:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
motion of interim study as
 
03:55:58.790 --> 03:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
i have a second
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
second by representative vale
 
03:56:02.870 --> 03:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
is there
 
03:56:04.950 --> 03:56:04.960 align:start position:0%

well let's uh
 
03:56:09.990 --> 03:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
to speak on your motion
 
03:56:11.830 --> 03:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
think we've said enough already okay
 
03:56:16.309 --> 03:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:16.319 --> 03:56:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:56:23.110 --> 03:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
i echo what's been said already i think
 
03:56:24.950 --> 03:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
we've been very thorough and i'm glad
 
03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.670 --> 03:56:31.680 align:start position:0%

03:56:34.469 --> 03:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:34.479 --> 03:56:35.269 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:56:37.510 --> 03:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
what the
 
03:56:40.070 --> 03:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
maker of the motion has done he's made
 
03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
he's made it he's made life's a lot
 
03:56:43.750 --> 03:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
simpler for the committee
 
03:56:45.750 --> 03:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate it because i think a
 
03:56:46.710 --> 03:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
03:56:49.510 --> 03:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
there is good things in this bill
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
03:56:53.189 --> 03:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know it it probably its time will
 
03:56:56.469 --> 03:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
come but not now but thank you very much
