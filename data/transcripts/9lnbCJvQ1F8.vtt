00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
one um I'm going to go ahead and get the
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
hearing started um before we
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
do uh if you could lead us in the Pledge
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
please to the flag the United States of
 
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
America and to the Republic for which it
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
stands one nation under God indivisible
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
with liberty and justice for
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
there I I was just about to say that I
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
hadn't spoken to will to find out if he
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
was going to um be on time and now I
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
know that he is um so first order of
 
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
business is we have a a public hearing
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
scheduled on on a non- gerine
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and and we we've discussed
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
this um when this was part of the house
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill that this was something we were
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
keeping in our pocket that if the Senate
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
version of the bill didn't come over
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
that we had a meth mechanism to work on
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
this um the underlying bill is a
 
00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
unemployment related bill um but not
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
close enough that we could simply attach
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
an amendment but if we hold a public
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on the amendment then um it it
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
becomes Germain so with that uh
 
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie if you could
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.790 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
and um I guess we don't
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
start good morning and U for the record
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
my name is Mark McKenzie I represent
 
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
40 uh and I'm here this morning uh to
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
introduce this amendment and to uh ask
 
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919 align:start position:0%
the for the committee
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
support the amendment is not unfamiliar
 
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
to this committee it had been brought up
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
before so I I don't think we have to uh
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
spend a whole lot of time but let me say
 
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
that it does uh the benefit of this
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
particular piece is that
 
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
preserves uh the framework of the
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
various steps of the unemployment
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
system it adds to that uh uh some top
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
steps to increase the rate so it go
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
because currently it's left at $41,500
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
which is a top rate uh the average uh
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit in New Hampshire if
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
I recall is about 350 some odd dollars a
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
week so what this does is it it uh it
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
basically puts that uh additional steps
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
at the top and there's a strategy for
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
for doing that because what it does is
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
it it at least brings it up to the
 
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959 align:start position:0%
survivable um uh number the number that
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
you need to actually survive within uh
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire it should be
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
is this is this amendment is a little
 
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
bit differently yeah so it brings it up
 
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.949 align:start position:0%
bit differently yeah so it brings it up
to

00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
60,000 uh the other thing it does is to
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
provide consistency across the scale so
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
the way that the system was was working
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
and works now is that the bottom end uh
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
replacement wage was around
 
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.750 align:start position:0%
replacement wage was around
55

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
55
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
58% so what happens uh as you move up
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
the scale is that the uh the
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
relationship between the replacement
 
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
rate uh and the benefit it starts to
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
deteriorate to the point where uh where
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
can be as low as probably 30% uh
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
replacement wages so what I Tred to do
 
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
on the scale is to is to preserve the
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
scale to level it across the across the
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
entire board uh because there's no real
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
reason why somebody who who is at the
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
lower end of scale uh is paid
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
differently in terms of the
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
ratio uh and I think you know I this is
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
and you inuy commissioner lers is here
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh this is somewhat frustrating in the
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
sense that this has been many many years
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
the last time the unemployment rate was
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
raised uh representative infantine was a
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
young man uh many many years ago and uh
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
and so we have not raised this rate for
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
years now if you consider that the
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
Unemployment uh
 
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is connected and was born as
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
part of the Social Security
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
act if we had told people receiving
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
Social Security in the room downstairs
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
that big chamber you're not going to
 
00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
receive any increase in your your Social
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
Security rate for 25 years to be held to
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
pay so why is it that we take unemployed
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
workers and we don't we don't treat them
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
the same we don't keep the schedule
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
current we don't we don't make sure that
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
the replacement wage uh is survivable I
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
think it's uh I think it's a big Miss in
 
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
terms of uh of you know of the uh of the
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
legislature not to move this thing
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
forward so I I asked for this you can
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
get the numbers um the numbers are a
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
little bit more expensive uh over the
 
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
course of the years uh then was a how
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill I think the Senate bill
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear the numbers and we heard
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee I think the Senate
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
bill was maybe 28 to 30 million uh and
 
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.839 align:start position:0%
this one's a little bit more than that
 
00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:28.839 align:start position:0%
this spreads it out over three years now
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
some people say why would do that cuz in
 
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
the end it's the same but I was trying
 
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
to be responsive to those people who
 
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
were uh I had heard early on that the
 
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
people wanted to kind of bring that on
 
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
board over a period of time so I try to
 
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
be uh try to address that as well um but
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
also let me say that the the trust fund
 
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
you can hear this from the Deputy
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioner I've been doing this aair
 
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
of my a little while I was on the
 
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment uh advisory committee for
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
many years uh in my position with the
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
aflci this is the most money we've ever
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
had as far as I know in the trust fund
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
there's over 400 million in the trust
 
00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
fund currently 104 million of which came
 
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
from the cares act which is a direct
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
contribution from the cares act into the
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
fund and what that did essentially was
 
00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:23.079 align:start position:0%
to was to take that money and accelerate
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh for the employers uh how they' got
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
the discount that much sooner so it was
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
a benefit certainly to the
 
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
employers um who by the way have the
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
third lowest uh uh tax rate in the
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
country uh so you got a fund that's got
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
400 million in it you've got the lowest
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
tax rate in the country you have one of
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
the lowest unemployment rates in the
 
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
country this is a time to do this this
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
is clearly a time to do this and and
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
this is a catch-up bill and I hope if we
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
can pass this bill and we can move
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
forward that we don't spent many many
 
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
years was 2007 I think it's the last
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
time we did this we don't take all of
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
that time to try try to bring this this
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
thing up this is about fness and about
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
equity and I'll end with this I've
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
worked on a number of uh layoffs big
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
layoffs I remember getting the call from
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh Governor Shaheen at the time who
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
told me that the Berlin paper mill was
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
going to close and it was not as it was
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
not a gentle end it was a very abrupt
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
closure of the of the Berlin paper mill
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
now Berlin New Hampshire those of you
 
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
who have been up there that's kind of a
 
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
world on its
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
own so when 3 4,000 people were laid off
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
unemployment was the only Lifeline they
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
had the only thing that kept them from
 
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:52.519 align:start position:0%
absolute poverty was the unemployment
 
00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:54.759 align:start position:0%
legislation and I work with those people
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
for years we set up a whole operation up
 
00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:00.759 align:start position:0%
there and the stories that we heard from
 
00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
people were incredible had this bill not
 
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
been in
 
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
place it would have been it would have
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
that Community would have been destroyed
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
let's bring this up to where it should
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
be so that when that safety net is
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
needed when we cast that net that it
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
catches people in a place in their lives
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
and supports them until I can get
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
through this uh through this problem uh
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
and get back to work and keep in mind
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
that for the most part we only people
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
only unemployment of less than 10 weeks
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire so I ask
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
the committee to stake this position out
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
as a house position and I'm here to
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have
 
00:15:40.829 --> 00:15:40.839 align:start position:0%
relative to that thank you Mr chairman
 
00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative infant time
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so I apologize I haven't been
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
around the last couple weeks um but I
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
was reviewing some emails over the
 
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
weekend and one of the things that had
 
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
never occurred to me when we were
 
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
discussing this legislation
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
um was the fact that Municipal and state
 
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
employers do not contribute and do not
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
pay unemployment they are required to um
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
pay back right all right so if someone
 
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
gets uh someone goes on unemployment in
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
the state or any of our towns and
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
they're out for 3 months on unemployment
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
they have to pay dollar for dollar back
 
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
to the unemployment never occurred to me
 
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
that that would be the issue that the
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
Senate was grappling
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
with what is what is
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
your your feeling there because because
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
again we I don't think any of us ever
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
thought about it when we were having our
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
discussions and that seems to be the
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
problem that the senate had with it well
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
I think you'll hear uh from the deputy
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
if if you're going to have him come up
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
here it's a fairly low number because we
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
talked about this in the committee uh
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
and I think the number comes in at about
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
over over 100,000
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was 110 some OD thousand
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
but the deputy commission can uh bring
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
us up to speed on that so it it is a um
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
you know potentially could be uh an
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
increase and I don't know what the
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate is within the public
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
sector um but this is this is in in in
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
the scheme of things it's a much smaller
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
group of people than would be the
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
general uh group that we're trying to
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
cover right now I think there's about I
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
don't last time I looked at probably
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
7500 or so people on unemployment I
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
don't know how many people from the
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
public sector very probably a fairly
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
small number and we have the number that
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
we do have a query that was done by the
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
department relative to that thank
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
 to follow up on what chairman
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
infantine said I believe it's not just
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities but it's also nonprofit
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
organizations are
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
payback as well so they don't pay in
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
they have the option to but they don't
 
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
dollar and we have the low third lowest
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
rate in the United States so it's a very
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
low rate for employeers they've got
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
every they have every uh discount that
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
they can get because the fund is hit the
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
400 million Mark um so this bill will
 
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
not change that at all will not increase
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
their rate it won't take the discount
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
away from uh from them
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh because the way that the system is
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
structured the way the discounts were
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
applied so I I think this is a I think
 
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
this is a good time to do this I really
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
do some point we got to do it further
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
much thank you um I have a card from
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
amendment he represents be
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
Mr juvet how many days left
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
sir um before you hit that beautiful
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
Oasis of Arizona well Mr chair I I
 
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
normally wouldn't have started my
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
testimony with this but since you asked
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
it's 5 months 17 days 6 hours 10 minutes
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
and 48
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
seconds well well deserved I'm I'm glad
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
to see you here at least maybe one final
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
time in front of Labor thank you um for
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Dave Juan I'm a
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
senior vice president uh for public
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
policy with the business and industry
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
Association we represent employers I
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
need to give what I would call nuanced
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
testimony for those of you that recall
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
when uh represent McKenzie's bill was
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
initially heard in this committee we did
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
not oppose that bill we did not testify
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
in support but we did not oppose it
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
because I think as an organization we
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
agree that there needs to be some of
 
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
valuation um
 
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
over adjusting the uh weekly
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit amounts it's been
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh well over 10 years maybe as possibly
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
as long as 15 years since that's taken
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
place um we had some qualms over the
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
language because we felt that it might
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
be taking maybe a little too aggressive
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
an approach that could impact the
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
balance of the trust fund especially if
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
there's an economic
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
downturn and if there were a severe
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
recession it would it would likely
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
bankrupt the trust fund and we would
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
have to borrow from the federal
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
government either of those cases would
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
result uh most certainly in higher
 
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
employment uh taxes higher employer
 
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.070 align:start position:0%
employment uh taxes higher employer
unemployment

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
taxes the Senate also had a bill Senate
 
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.710 align:start position:0%
taxes the Senate also had a bill Senate
Bill

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
436 and we were quite involved in that
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
and I thought we would be involved in
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
that the same way we would be involved
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
in representative McKenzie's bill which
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
was that's the initial proposal all the
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders get together we Hammer
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
something out that everybody can live
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
with that's not what happened in the
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
house and and the bill was tabled and
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
there it sat the Senate bill Senate 436
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Perkins quook was the Prime
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor there was significant discussion
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
about that we
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
participated uh those people
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
representing labor participated the
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
department was was at the table and we
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
came up with language that uh we we
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
meaning the Bia wouldn't have let the
 
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
charge on but it was something we could
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
live with we let everyone know we we can
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
live with this it raises uh weekly
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
benefit thresholds it increases that
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
maximum uh salary from 4 1 I think to 65
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
if I remember her language correctly it
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
did a lot of good things for uh
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
individuals who might find themselves
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
unemployed it also did it by the way in
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
a way that according to the Department's
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
evaluation could be implemented with
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
little to no risk that employers would
 
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
see a tax increase or the uh taxable
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
wage base which is currently at 14,000
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
being increase those are the two ways
 
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
that you bring more money into the trust
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
fund the the way it worked was they
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
increased the thresholds for discounts
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
now that's not the most desirable thing
 
00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
from an employer perspective however uh
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
represent McKenzie correctly stated the
 
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
trust fund is is very rich right now and
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
even if you implemented uh the
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
provisions of senot 436 it would not
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
have an immediate impact on those
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
thresholds so the point is you could
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
have done this and employers at least in
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
the short term would feel no impact from
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
it the Senate chose not to move forward
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
with that bill I believe it was tabled
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
on a I think a 14 to 10
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
vote um so here we
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
are uh Senate Bill 330 passed that also
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
was a bill that uh we participated in
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
had some initial qualms over spent a
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
significant time with the department and
 
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
received in assurances and we have
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
confidence in the Department's ability
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to administer that if it
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
becomes law in a way that uh individuals
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
will not take advantage of it and in a
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
way that it will not negatively impact
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
employers my concern with the non-
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
gerine amendment is we're not early in
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
the session now we're late in the
 
00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
session we do not have the time time or
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
the luxury to begin opening up
 
00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:04.039 align:start position:0%
negotiations about what individual
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
parties can and cannot live with we have
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
what the language is and my
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
concern is twofold one I feel that will
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
have a negative impact on trust fund
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
balances and will have a negative impact
 
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.110 align:start position:0%
balances and will have a negative impact
on

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
employers but more of more over than
 
00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
that we already know what the Senate's
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
position is they were not willing to go
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
with with a bill
 
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919 align:start position:0%
that we were okay
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
with they tabled that and my concern is
 
00:24:38.389 --> 00:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
if this gets attached to 3:30 and goes
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
back across the um to the other chamber
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
I can see one of two things
 
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
happening the third thing which is they
 
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
would concur I don't see happening at
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
all I think they will either just non-c
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
Concur and the bill will be killed or
 
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
they will ask for a committee of
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
conference and demand that this Germain
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
language be
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
stripped um and if it's not they won't
 
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh sign a committee of conference report
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
and again the bill goes down so I'm
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
asking you um to preserve what what uh I
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
think everyone thought was was a bill
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
that was necessary to update language
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
relating to remote work which is what
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
330 is and save this discussion for for
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
another session I I assure you um Bia
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
will participate that in that and we
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
will participate in a way that
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
recognizes that there should be some
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
adjustment but the adjustments in this
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
amendment are too too fast and too high
 
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
for us be happy to answer any questions
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
suent one of the differences between the
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
Senate bill and this amendment um is
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
that uh this amendment does not increase
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
the thresholds um which was a conscious
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
decision um in discussion in the interim
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
um because the thresholds have been
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
adjusted um fairly recently in such a
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
way that um frankly it likely is um uh
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
sufficient that we don't need to adjust
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
the thresholds again um therefore not
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
adjusting the thresholds actually I
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
think makes this more attractive than
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
the sen of version it may even bring the
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
a sen of version on board I I
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree um and having
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
participated in every minute of the
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
Senate discussion I assure you that not
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%
changing those thresholds will not
 
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
change uh Senators positions on on how
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
they voted on this issue I recognize
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
that that this language does not change
 
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
the thresholds I would say the
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
thresholds become irrelevant if if we
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
have a a economic slowdown or a
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
recession or God help us a severe
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
recession because we'll be well below
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
those thresholds so the discounts that
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
those are provided uh that positive
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
rated employers benefit from from those
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
thresholds won't matter because the
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
trust fund will be well below those
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
limits uh Mr chairman thank you Mr ju is
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
your uh association's biggest concern
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
individual increases for each level of
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
earned wages or is it that overall if
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
there is an economic downturn not as
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
severe asbe 2008 or and there um
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic that a um moderate
 
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.430 align:start position:0%
pandemic that a um moderate
slowdown

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
slowdown
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
will severely deplete the balance the in
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
in the event of a moderate
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
slowdown uh this bill will deplete the
 
00:28:03.149 --> 00:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
balance far quicker than what the uh
 
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
proposed language in 436 was 436 did not
 
00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.830 align:start position:0%
proposed language in 436 was 436 did not
increase

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
um levels that are already set it added
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
new levels from 41 to 65 so the impact
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
would be far far less uh this one and
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sure if if he were asked the
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
department could testify this one would
 
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
cause a draw down far quicker
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative kahill thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr J so the concern with
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
drawing down the trust fund balance uh
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh even if we don't get to the point
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
where we have to borrow money from the
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
federal government uh is that the
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
discounts will will will evaporate and
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
the the employers might pay as much as
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
$90 instead of the current $80 average
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
per a year
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
well it could potentially be a lot
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
higher than that if in addition to
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
losing the discounts there's an increase
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the taxable wage base or an increase
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
in the tax rate both of which happened
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
in the last uh severe recession in 2008
 
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
and both of which I might add Bia signed
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
on to because we recognized um how
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
severe the situation was and we also
 
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
recognized representative taking that
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
action at the state level allowed New
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to pay that money back to the
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
federal government with no interest
 
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:33.799 align:start position:0%
something virtually no other state was
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
able to do so we were willing to take on
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
some short-term pain for the long-term
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
gain thank you any further
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony at this point I
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
have no other cards however uh everyone
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
who spoken has referred us to the um
 
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner to answer some
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
questions I I don't know if you had a a
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
something you wanted to prepared to say
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
or you just want to go into
 
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
questions um I could address some of the
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
issues that have been brought up that
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
way hit some high points thank allow
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
since well I can do whatever you want me
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
to do since you control what happens
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
here I like your I like what you suggest
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
so go ahead uh Richard lers Deputy
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioner New Hampshire employment
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
security uh to address the issue of of
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
taxpaying employers versus reimbursing
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
employers so um New Hampshire uh
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
requires that the state as an employer
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
is a mandated reimbursal so the state
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
has to report quarterly employment but
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't pay quarterly taxes so when a
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
state employee is separated and it's
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
determined they're eligible for
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment the state then reimburses
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
the trust fund dollar for dollar for the
 
00:30:55.629 --> 00:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
benefits that are paid out local
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
employers so Municipal and County
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
um they have the option to be a
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursal or they can be treated as a
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
taxpayer the overwhelming majority of
 
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
them choose to be a reimbursing employer
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
about 90% of local and County employers
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
reimburse they do not pay taxes um and
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
then they they pay into the fund like
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
the state when they have a for when they
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
have an employee that's eligible uh
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
private nonprofits they also have a
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
choice they can be a reimbursal or they
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
can can be a taxpaying employer four
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
profit employers do not have a choice
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
they are mandated taxpaying employers so
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
they pay a quarterly tax that is based
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
on their experience or their risk to the
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
unemployment fund where we look at taxes
 
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
paid benefits paid out they have a rate
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
and they pay that rate on the first
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
$144,000 which is that taxable wage base
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
that you've heard mentioned they pay
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
that on the first 14 to each employee uh
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
for the year
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
so when you look at overall employment
 
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
levels I just did a quick math and
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
looking at our most recent quarterly
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
reports from employers so this is New
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire reported employment State
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
Employment is a little under 3% of total
 
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
employment and local employment is a
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
little under
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
7% of total employment in the State uh
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
when we did uh when we were talking with
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee about um an impact on
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
the state as an employer um the
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
state looking at calendar year
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
2023 uh the state was charged uh just
 
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.350 align:start position:0%
2023 uh the state was charged uh just
over

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
$142,000 in re in reimbursements that
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
they had to pay to the unemployment fund
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
if that were increased um by say the the
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
amount of the the Senate Bill the
 
00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
amended Senate bill that would have been
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
another 30
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
$7,000 it' be slightly higher um with
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
the amended house bill cuz the amended
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
house bill which is being amended here
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
in desc Senate Bill 330 had had slightly
 
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.070 align:start position:0%
in desc Senate Bill 330 had had slightly
higher

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
impact uh so those were were those uh
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
numbers with regard to the impact on the
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
trust fund that we've talked about so we
 
00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
did I see some of you looking at the the
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
charts that were reviewed um uh a while
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
back when the committee had that hearing
 
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
so we did stress test the fund we did
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
look to see what the impact on the trust
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
fund both um at the the in the current
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
climate right now um with a strong
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
economy and we also looked at a moderate
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
and severe recession scenarios to see
 
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
what all of the bills would do and when
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
we did that with um the amended version
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 1522 which was a uh
 
00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced uh cost from the
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
original House Bill 1522 when we looked
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
at that the increase in projected
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
benefit payments when we when we looked
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
at actual benefit payments in 2023 would
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
be that if this Bill had been in effect
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
it would have been a 33% in total
 
00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
payments going out um that was about an
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
$8.5 million increase so going from 26
 
00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:26.919 align:start position:0%
million in actual payments to if this
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
Bill had been in effect it would have
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
been 34.5 million in actual payments
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
trust fund right now is at $400
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
million um when we projected that out
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
through the end of our forecasted period
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
which goes out through the end of
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
2025 we project the trust fund right now
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
would be at 393 million um at the end of
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
2025 without anything being done if this
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
bill were to go into effect it'd be
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
about $40 million lower or just over
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
$350 million
 
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
when we look at a modest recession so
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
something similar to the early 2000s
 
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
where unemployment goes from you know
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
right now we're at 2.6% but unemployment
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
gets up to
 
00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
45% um you'd be looking
 
00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.790 align:start position:0%
45% um you'd be looking
at

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
um without any changes the trust fund
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
would be just under $340 million and if
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
1522 is amended were in effect you'd be
 
00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.079 align:start position:0%
looking at about
 
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:32.599 align:start position:0%
$265 million so about a little over a
 
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
$60 million impact in a modest recession
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
so three just under 340 current state
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
265 with this bill in
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
effect if we looked at a Great Recession
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
scenario so New Hampshire sustaining
 
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment at about
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
62% uh like we did uh with the 2008 2009
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
Great Recession
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh we project that the trust fund would
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
go down without any changes the trust
 
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
fund would be would go down to 162
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
million if this bill were in effect we
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
would we um forecast that the fund would
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
go uh to just over $106
 
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
million so um there you're looking at
 
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
about another um you know 55 million in
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
um additional dispersements benefits
 
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
going out so that so that's the stress
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
testing that we did um in um either
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
scenario either doing nothing or House
 
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.150 align:start position:0%
scenario either doing nothing or House
Bill

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
1522 um as long as the downturn
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
behaved consistently with one of these
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
models which it should we looked we used
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
actual recessions actual economic uh
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
conditions that New Hampshire has
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
experienced in the past the trust fund
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
would not run out of money um um so um
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's the the the testing that we had
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
done and um just looking at the the the
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
amendment um again the amendment does
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
not do anything to the bottom 17
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
existing benefit amounts those stay the
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
same that wage replacement rate is right
 
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
around 58 to
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
60% so someone collecting in those
 
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
bottom tier um earning levels is going
 
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
to going to get about 58% of their wages
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
replaced by their unemployment benefit
 
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
the next 35 of the existing tiers
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
because we have 52 existing tiers that
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
are in statute the next 35 would be
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
increased with this proposal and then
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
the proposal would uh Implement 19 new
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
tiers over 3 years so 19 additional
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
tiers it would bring the maximum weekly
 
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.950 align:start position:0%
tiers it would bring the maximum weekly
benefit

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
up from currently at
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
$427 a week which is where it's been
 
00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:03.230 align:start position:0%
$427 a week which is where it's been
since

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
2007 um that right now if you earn
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
$41,500 in your four quarter base period
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's what you qualify for
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
$427 a week about a 54% wage replacement
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
if you earn $755,000 right now you still
 
00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.630 align:start position:0%
if you earn $755,000 right now you still
get

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
$427 a week so the average private
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
sector wage earner right now if they
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
were to lose their job unexpectedly in
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
need unemployment they'd be looking at a
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rate of about
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
30% so we're replacing 30% of their
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
earnings from what they had earned um
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
the new top tier would be
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
672 um that would be payable to someone
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
$60,000 um or at
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
$60,000 and that wage replacement rate
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
is is about
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
58% so the new proposed tiers maintain a
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rate of about
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
58% the difference between that and the
 
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
Senate amended Bill the Senate amended
 
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
Bill maintained a wage replacement rate
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
for those upper tiers of
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
54% so that was the the main difference
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
and the reason why there's a difference
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
in cost uh between the two but I'll I'll
 
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
stop there and I'll allow uh the
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
committee to do what it is the committee
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
wants to do all right thank you very
 
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.069 align:start position:0%
wants to do all right thank you very
much

00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
um representative kahill a question
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
labors uh do you have any way of looking
 
00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
at the economic impacts that these
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
increases would be for our economy to
 
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
the people who currently getting 427
 
00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
then getting this bump and and their
 
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.430 align:start position:0%
then getting this bump and and their
Wakely

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
Wakely
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
benefits um well it so that so that that
 
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
average person coming in right now is
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
getting uh three out of every $10
 
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
replaced right so this would increase
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
that um to slightly higher we do know
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
that unemployment benefits are not uh
 
00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
dollars that are saved they are dollars
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
that are spent uh they are dollars that
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
are spent in our local communities and
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
it does allow um uh people to avoid
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
needing to to depend on their local
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities for support during an
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
econ an unexpected economic hardship uh
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
so we know those dollars are spent right
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
away during the pandemic we paid out uh
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
just over $2 billion
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
that went right into the New Hampshire
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
economy thank you are there further
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
Sullivan you said that under the current
 
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
um setup um the average um benefit is
 
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
30% um that's covering everything from
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
the the lowest earner to the highest
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
earner who's unemployed um what would
 
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
the average be with under the amendment
 
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
because you said it's 58% at 60,000 but
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
you didn't mention the average rate
 
00:40:59.950 --> 00:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so that was when we when we looked
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
at the average private sector wage
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
earner based on actual employer reports
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's where those those numbers came
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
from so right now when that um
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
individual comes in and there in the mid
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
to Upper 60s uh in terms of annual
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
earnings um they they receive right now
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
about a 30% wage replacement with that
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
427 uh this proposed bill um have having
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh six what did we
 
00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.710 align:start position:0%
uh six what did we
say

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
672 if you earned
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
$60,000 in your base period so now
 
00:41:41.309 --> 00:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
you're up you're closer uh to that mid
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
50s to uh you know 55% wage replacement
 
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
rather than being in the
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
30s if you are a $60,000 wage earner and
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're getting 672 your wage replacement
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
rate is
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
58% follow up um
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
so so the um the average is very close
 
00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
to the 58,000 or I'm sorry 58% correct
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
it'd be it'd be slightly under that
 
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
because that average earner is a little
 
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
bit higher than what the the proposed
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
Max tier would be here and and there are
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
some people who are earning over 60,000
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
who um are capped at the 60,000 rate
 
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
correct so if you come in if you earned
 
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:22.950 align:start position:0%
correct so if you come in if you earned
uh

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
$500,000 you're still capped at whatever
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
that Max weekly Ben benit amount is
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
right now that's 427 thank
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
stop thank you um one of the concerns
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
that was just expressed um was that if
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
we had a major recession we would need
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
to borrow money um from the federal
 
00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
government in order to refill the
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
coffers and and pay out unemployment if
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
we do nothing um in a severe recession
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
that if Brian gotab were here our our
 
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
state Economist he would not answer your
 
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
question um what I can tell you is what
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
we have experienced right so during the
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
Great Recession New Hampshire did need
 
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
to borrow in order to pay unemployment
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
benefits we borrowed twice each time we
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
borrowed about $60
 
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
million um the legislature responded and
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh both business and workers came in
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
made sacrifices and that was quickly
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
repaid as Mr juv had mentioned New
 
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire avoided all borrowing costs
 
00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
that was free money uh for New Hampshire
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
and then our our trust fund quickly uh
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
rebounded after that what we're looking
 
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
at right now when we stress test uh the
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
fund for this bill we look at that
 
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559 align:start position:0%
experience we don't look at some other
 
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
hypothetical recession we look at the
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
actual experience from both a mild and
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
severe recession and in both of those
 
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
situations the trust fund would continue
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
to be able to pay benefits without
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
borrowing however the next economic
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
downturn could be quite different than
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
either of those but that's the best we
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
can do with the existing information
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative kahill thank
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
you again Mr chair and thank you again
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
Mr labors when you said free money it
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
just kind of triggered a recent memory
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
and actually those are the best ones um
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't there 14 million in arpa money
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
that was used to bulk up the uh trust
 
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
fund to give those discounts a little
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
sooner that free
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
money um there was 109 million um and
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
free money is never free right that's a
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
bad bad expression that I used um the
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
trust fund was the beneficiary of $109
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
million over the course of the pandemic
 
00:44:58.870 --> 00:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
in unused but previous L obligated cares
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
act money and that was a decision from
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
the governor um where rather than
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
allowing that money to go back to
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
Washington DC he decided that we're
 
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
going to try to use it in these programs
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
of need but when those programs of need
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
do not use all of the obligated money
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
rather than losing that money let's have
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
it go somewhere where it stays in New
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the decision was that it
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
will go into the unemployment trust fund
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about the trust fund
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
being at 400 million right now 109 of
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
that came in as a result of unused
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
obligated cares act dollars to prevent
 
00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
them from going back to uh the federal
 
00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:41.559 align:start position:0%
government thank you and thank you for
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
that question I I never had it so
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
succinctly explained I Now understand
 
00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:50.839 align:start position:0%
what that means further
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Alani thank you
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and Deputy Commissioner lers
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's always good to have you here with
 
00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.990 align:start position:0%
it's always good to have you here with
us

00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to if this amendment
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
goes through goes through the house
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
um during the 2008 recession would there
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
be more positive employers paying a
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
penalty longer than than during that
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
time um I'll try to answer it and if I'm
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
going in the wrong direction you tell me
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
that's not what you meant but you
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
buttered me up by saying that you liked
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
having me here so
 
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.190 align:start position:0%
having me here so
um

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
so the changes that were made to the the
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
statutory changes that were made a few
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
budget Cycles ago with the the solvency
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
controls in state law the
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
um thresholds were changed so the fund
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
balance reduction thresholds when
 
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
employers get a reduction to their rate
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
when the fund is achieving um
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
important balance Milestones where the
 
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
the pressure can be reduced on employers
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
because the fund does not need more
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
Revenue because it's gotten to a point
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
where it is solvent those were increased
 
00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:12.559 align:start position:0%
except for the first level so for the
 
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
last decade the first level of the
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
balance in the trust fund where
 
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
employers have received a reduction has
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
always been $250 million that goes back
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
to the the changes made by the
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
legislature um in the LA in the Great
 
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
Recession that was not changed so
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
employers right now still get a half
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
Point reduction to their rate and um to
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
think about the importance of a half
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
point when a new employer comes in at
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
2.7% if you're to take 0.5 off that's a
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
significant reduction um so it's still
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
at $250 million right now the employers
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
get a 1% reduction when the trust fund
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
achieves a $350 million balance for an
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
entire quarter that's where they are
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
right now they're getting a 1% reduction
 
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
and if the fund maintains a balance of
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
400 million for an entire quarter every
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
day of that quarter they get a 1 and a
 
00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:09.630 align:start position:0%
day of that quarter they get a 1 and a
half%

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
half%
 
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
reduction the most significant change
 
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
made um with the solvency controls in my
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
mind was not the increase to the top two
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
balance thresholds bringing those up to
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
350 and 400 million to allow the fund to
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
achieve true solvency which is where it
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
is at right now I think the more
 
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
significant change was the elimination
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
of the search charges that kicked in on
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
employers when they could least afford
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
to pay it so prior to those changes when
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
the trust funds started to drop there
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
were two half Point SE charges so an
 
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
employer would not only lose their fund
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
balance reductions but then they would
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
actually get hit with sear charges on
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
their rate a uh 0 five was the
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
discretionary to the commissioner and
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
the other 0.5 was mandated if the fund
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
fell below $150 million those were both
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
eliminated and the theory behind that
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
was that if we allow the fund to grow to
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
a true point of solvency during a time
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
when the economy is growing when
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
employment is growing and employers can
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
afford to pay it then we don't need to
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
have that additional SE charge hitting
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
employers when they can when they can
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
least afford to pay it in a downturn so
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
right now you you as the fund is
 
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
depleted because benefit payments are
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
going up unemployment is up um the your
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
the the um experience of the employer is
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
a gradual or maybe an all of a sudden
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
loss in the fund balance reduction so
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
rather than getting that 1% uh reduction
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
you're back to your true experienced
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
rate however you do not have any sirar
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
charges right now those have been
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
eliminated from St
 
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
statute follow follow um and for
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
positive rated employeers and negative
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
rated employers would an increase like
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
this tip more from the positive into a
 
00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:10.799 align:start position:0%
negative rating which could affect their
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
payments so any anytime it's a it's a
 
00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
very good point because anytime you're
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of benefit
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
payments that are going
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
out it will have some level of impact on
 
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
employers because of the way that their
 
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
rates are set for un employment uh tax
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
purposes because this is this is an
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
insurance program it's it's risk-based
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
so we evaluate the risk of the employer
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
to the trust fund and when we say risk
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
we mean what is the likelihood that
 
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:42.799 align:start position:0%
you're going to cause dollars to be your
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
employment decisions or economic
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
conditions um is going to result in your
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
employees being unemployed and needing
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
to draw down from the unemployment trust
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
fund so when you increase the amount of
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
benefits being paid out per week to an
 
00:50:58.990 --> 00:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
individual ual that is going to then
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
impact the experience of the employer if
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
they're not laying very many people off
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
it will be a small impact but if they
 
00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:08.839 align:start position:0%
have are having regular impacts or unex
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
or regular layoffs or or um unexpected
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
layoffs due to whatever reason it will
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
result in higher benefit charges to
 
00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:21.559 align:start position:0%
their experience now they might be
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
sufficiently positive rated meaning that
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
over the entire history of that employer
 
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:28.839 align:start position:0%
being an employer in New Hampshire
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
because we look all the way back to when
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
the employer first started and
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
registered in the state as an employer
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
if they are are close to the line
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
meaning that their total taxes paid in
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
are close to what the total benefits are
 
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
that have been paid out where that that
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
could tip them from going positive to
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
negative that would cause an increase in
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
rates so the the lowest rates are
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
reserved for those that cost the trust
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
fund the less the least amount right so
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
you're in the most advantageous tax
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
table which is in statute if you are not
 
00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:11.559 align:start position:0%
causing um a high benefit payments to
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
the trust fund if you're
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh recently positive rated but have some
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
sort of event that causes a significant
 
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
amount of unemployment um and you become
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
negative rated you go into our middle
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
table which is for those employers that
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
have been negative rated for less than 4
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
years and if you are chronically
 
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
negative rated um you know you have a
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
seasonal pattern to your Employments
 
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
you're laying people off every year
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
those employers are the the biggest um
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
cost to the trust fund they pay the
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
highest rate and they pay at the the
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
third table which has the highest rates
 
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
and can be up to Mid seven I think we're
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
at 7 and 1 12%
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
if you're negative rated you don't get
 
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
those fund balance reductions either um
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
you get an you get an inverse search
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
charge so as the fund Falls your a
 
00:53:10.589 --> 00:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
negative rated employer sees their SE
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
charge go up and as the fund increases
 
00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
they see their negative rated Sur charge
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
go down so that's kind of the
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
distinction between positive and
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
negative uh rated employers and how they
 
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
we try to assess that risk by the amount
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
that they're required to pay in thank
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman a final question if I
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
may um when you looked at the benefit
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
amounts and the time that people spent
 
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
on unemployment do you see an increase
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
in the time spent on unemployment given
 
00:53:47.069 --> 00:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's moving to
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
58% um well well I think the existence
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
of unemployment benefits increases the
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
length of unemployment but it but it's
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to right it's supposed to
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
provide a stabilizing Force to allow
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
that individual to go to a job hopefully
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat com comparable to what they
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
were doing rather than being in a a
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
situation of desperation so just the
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
existing existence of unemployment
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
benefits increase the length of
 
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment right now New Hampshire
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're right around average
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
duration of 10 10 to 11 weeks um it has
 
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
um increased slightly over the last few
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
months but still significantly below
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
where we were in 2019 which by all
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
measures was a strong economy um so I
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
would I would expect that there there
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
could be um some level of impact
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
increasing duration um obviously when we
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
stress test the fund with this bill that
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
is increased duration because we're
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
modeling it after those those recession
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
scenarios which has a higher number of
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
average weeks uh that people file for
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
but overall New Hampshire has uh one of
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
the lowest um average durations um in
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
the country so 101 weeks um despite 26
 
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
being available um and anytime you
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
increase benefits there could
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
potentially be a a slight increase um to
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
the length of time of filing but again
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're looking at you know rather than uh
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
54 % wage replacement going up to 58%
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how um noticeable that
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
would be in terms of increasing duration
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
representative kahill again Mr Shar and
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr labors when an
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
employer uh lays off someone and pays
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
them their unearned uh their unused
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
vacation time that's a that's a positive
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
for the trust fund isn't
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
it as so they delay maybe even there's
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
no need in a strong economy like we have
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
they don't even have to even have to
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
claim a weat do they um well so it it is
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
counted against their eligibility right
 
00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
so if you're earning $1,000 a week and
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
part of your you you unfortunately lose
 
00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
your job and you're paid $5,000 for
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
whatever reason is that is going to
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
delay your eligibility for unemployment
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
by 5 weeks um so it doesn't reduce the
 
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
number of weeks you're eligible for you
 
00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:27.039 align:start position:0%
could still file for 26
 
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
um but you're not going to be eligible
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
until that that separation payment is
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
exhausted followup and this in turn
 
00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
benefits the trust fund that we so
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
protect it is in all of our interest to
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
protect the trust fund uh very much so
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
employers and workers um and yes that um
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
because of the strong economy um there
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh is strong demand for jobs across all
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
Industries right now if an employer is
 
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
providing some sort of Separation
 
00:57:05.029 --> 00:57:05.039 align:start position:0%
payment that is going to have a positive
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
impact on the trust fund because there
 
00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
will be fewer dollars that are being
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
paid out yes thank you Mr L any further
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
much for all your oh we do have uh
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
representative buar thank you Mr chair
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you Deputy Commissioner labors
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
as you as always you've uh
 
00:57:29.789 --> 00:57:29.799 align:start position:0%
been able to saturate my brain with your
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
it uh so thank you for your testimony as
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
I said I I have no further cards I do
 
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
see we have our representative from the
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
County Association and there since a
 
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
number of people mentioned the impact on
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
the counties there might be a question
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh so if you wouldn't mind uh stepping
 
00:57:57.789 --> 00:57:57.799 align:start position:0%
forward and and
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
send us a card too yeah well you can
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
after you're done you can fill out a
 
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:04.839 align:start position:0%
card yeah I will fill out a pin card
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
after uh I finish uh Kate Horan New
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties um the
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
association is opposed to the amendment
 
00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
um particularly for those smaller
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
counties while a 20 to 30% potential
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
increase for hillsbor and Rockingham can
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
they probably absorb that yeah can Coos
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
and Sol
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's probably going to be a more
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
significant impact on their budget um
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
particularly um I don't know what the
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates are for the county so
 
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
I apologize for not having that
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
information with you but um if it is a
 
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
significant increase to those smaller
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
counties that means likely an increase
 
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
in uh County taxes but I'm happy to try
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
and answer any questions that folks have
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
so are there questions representative
 
00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.230 align:start position:0%
so are there questions representative
kale

00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
kale
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss Morgan is is it
 
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
generally safe to assume that you know
 
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
in your experience and your observations
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
that layoffs at the county level are
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
rare even in those aforementioned
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
counties um there a challenging question
 
00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:14.839 align:start position:0%
to answer representative kahill and I do
 
00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
know some counties have eliminated
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
certain positions over the years and
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
people have either chosen to stay or not
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
stay but I don't have any historical
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
data for you today I
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you I will I would like
 
00:59:34.349 --> 00:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that question um Deputy

subcommittee was to figure out what we

could all agree on um there's certainly
 
01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
issues to debate on this bill and but I
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
wanted us to come away and agree ment
 
01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
and uh one thing we could all agree on
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee is that if you look
 
01:37:31.950 --> 01:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
at the history of this bill when this
 
01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:34.360 align:start position:0%
language was submitted to the Senate at

the same time and just to be clear for
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
everyone who's walked in this is a bill
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
that deals with the position of raas um
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
in Residence Halls at universities and
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
the bill was suggesting changing the
 
01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
01:37:54.589 --> 01:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
employment um so when that language was
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
put in on the Senate side the uh
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
representatives from the universities
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
that were in here in our meetings were
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
also working with the Department of
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
Labor and as that part of that process
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
the department made a revision to their
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
rules um in the October December time
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
frame at the end of last year and as far
 
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
as I can tell they corrected the problem
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
that existed and as far as I can tell
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
there is no other outstanding
 
01:38:33.589 --> 01:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
issue um that the rules will not address
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
properly so it has been uh we've said a
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
number of times in this committee that
 
01:38:42.589 --> 01:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
if the department can handle something
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh there is no need for us to intervene
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
by changing legislation and this is a
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
complicated enough issue that I think if
 
01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
we start changing rsas and changing
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
definitions we could easily have some
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences so the
 
01:38:59.070 --> 01:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the subcommittee and
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
my motion is that we itl this bill we
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
let the rules take their course and if
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
sometime in the future we realize that
 
01:39:10.270 --> 01:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
things still aren't working we can put
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
in new legislation to address that thank
 
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
you Solin thank you m Mr Mr
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
Speaker not happy Mr
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
like he said first of all um and I would
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
just also point out that this um bill as
 
01:39:33.149 --> 01:39:33.159 align:start position:0%
presented initially presented it changed
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
um six different statutes uh to remove
 
01:39:40.510 --> 01:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
workers rights um in New Hampshire
 
01:39:44.669 --> 01:39:44.679 align:start position:0%
rsas um it became apparent that that um
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
actually wasn't necessary because the
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment law already made that
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
exception so the sixth one was stripped
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
out left five um but the bottom line is
 
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:55.719 align:start position:0%
that's way more than could possibly be
 
01:39:58.589 --> 01:39:58.599 align:start position:0%
necessary in the first place and
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
secondly as um representative seaworth
 
01:40:04.109 --> 01:40:04.119 align:start position:0%
said uh we have a rules change that we
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
believe is going to address the um the
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
issue it's going to allow um colleges
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
that have concerns about minimum wage or
 
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
tracking hours or anything like that to
 
01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
apply for a a
 
01:40:19.629 --> 01:40:19.639 align:start position:0%
waiver with that waiver um their um
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
issues would be resolved um so um
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
there's really no need to go changing
 
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
statutes stripping rights um there's a
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
Avenue just like with the unemployment
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
that's already taken care of we believe
 
01:40:35.950 --> 01:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
that the uh rules change that the um
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor have um undertaken
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
um take care of that department and it
 
01:40:45.070 --> 01:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
also became apparent that the um uh
 
01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:49.639 align:start position:0%
employment status of um these resident
 
01:40:55.109 --> 01:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
Halls advisers um is viewed differently
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
by um different Federal um departments
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
as well as by um potentially uh State
 
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
entities so um
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
it it's going to probably have to work
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
its way out over time but we believe
 
01:41:13.709 --> 01:41:13.719 align:start position:0%
that the issue at hand has been
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
addressed so um I agree with the U um uh
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
motion of itl and ask everyone to
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:28.360 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
comments the chair has just two quick
 
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.189 align:start position:0%
comments the chair has just two quick
ones

01:41:32.189 --> 01:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
ones
 
01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
um uh the the chairman Vice chairman I
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
received a a memo and I will make sure
 
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
everyone gets it I thought everyone did
 
01:41:41.589 --> 01:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
get it it was a list of every single
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
University and college in the state and
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
it had different columns in it and the
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
columns had who gets uh stien who gets
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
free room who gets free board who gets
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
both or whatever and it was a a
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
a mishmash of different things about who
 
01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:57.229 align:start position:0%
a mishmash of different things about who
got

01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
what anything that we change is going to
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
cause harm to
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
another if we fix one for one University
 
01:42:07.229 --> 01:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
or one college it it's going to be
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the other that's my first
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
point my second point is I like laws
 
01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:12.589 align:start position:0%
point my second point is I like laws
versus

01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
versus
 
01:42:15.870 --> 01:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
rules um so I would like to see a new
 
01:42:17.790 --> 01:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
bill come next year but it has to take
 
01:42:19.229 --> 01:42:19.239 align:start position:0%
into account all the different
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances there are other parts of
 
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:23.719 align:start position:0%
the law that we have
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh that some of you may remember from
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
your tenure here ski
 
01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
instructors they don't get paid but they
 
01:42:32.669 --> 01:42:32.679 align:start position:0%
get free skiing you know there's other
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that are in our law where it
 
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
this could be addressed so um hopefully
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
that will will occur next year uh but I
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
agree with the in expenditure legislate
 
01:42:44.589 --> 01:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
motion are there any other
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
comments Madam
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
clerk I'll just add it's kind of awesome
 
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
that we all agree on this that's nice um
 
01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
it's also Complicated by the fact that
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
when these positions were developed and
 
01:43:03.790 --> 01:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
before they evolved to be so much
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
differently um part of what they gain
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
given how expensive it is to go to
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
college in New Hampshire we have the
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
highest state tuition in in the country
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
too for so it's about even at our state
 
01:43:21.390 --> 01:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
schools um the value for what Ras get
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
depending on which part of of the
 
01:43:26.189 --> 01:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
package they get for what they do is
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
really complicated and and so much
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
different now because of the cost of
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
college and all the related expenses so
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
that's another caveat Madam clerk would
 
01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
it surprise you that I was an R
 
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
yes uh before we take a vote we need to
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
make some um introductions we have some
 
01:43:49.709 --> 01:43:49.719 align:start position:0%

thank you um Mr chair I have noticed in

the room there are a number of people
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
who are clearly guests of the house and
 
01:45:58.189 --> 01:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you might want to find out

Committee in you announce it uh just uh
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
will had mentioned a table that how
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
different universities treated the ra
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
positions differently that was a
 
01:47:16.109 --> 01:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
document that was supplied to the
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um I just sent a scan of
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
that to the house labor um group so if
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
anyone was one wondering what that was
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
look in your email and you should see it
 
01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I will add that it doesn't
 
01:47:29.589 --> 01:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
include Dartmouth because the
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
organization that put that together has
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
the Consortium of every actually I think
 
01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
it's three un I forget the other two
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
Thomas Moore is there a Thomas Moore
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
college and there's the third one that's
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
not on there because they're not in that
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
good our final bill for the session on
 
01:47:57.149 --> 01:47:57.159 align:start position:0%
Executive session is Senate Bill 330
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
FN I like like recognize representative
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
Sullivan for a
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
18658 the amendment has been moved I
 
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
have a second please second from represa
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
Susi you recognized to speak to your
 
01:48:23.790 --> 01:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
motion thank you
 
01:48:27.589 --> 01:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
these are strange times that we live in
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
um I think we've got an amendment here
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
that excuse me addresses an issue that I
 
01:48:39.550 --> 01:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
believe many of us on both sides feels
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
is in need of being addressed um the
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
um the bottom line is that um we did
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
speak with the clerk out in the hallway
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
and the clerk has um told us that the um
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
the speaker will rule this amendment out
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
of order um I'm moving it I'm asking
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
people to vote for it simply so we can
 
01:49:06.990 --> 01:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
send a message um to the world that we
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
think this is is an issue that's um in
 
01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
need of being
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
addressed so um um unemployment table
 
01:49:16.629 --> 01:49:16.639 align:start position:0%
has not changed since
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
2007 that's way too long we have a very
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
low maximum benefit
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
um that could be addressed by um adding
 
01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:30.560 align:start position:0%
levels to that table and um both a
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that U uh did not pass as
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
well as the um um bill that
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie proposed now
 
01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
sits on the
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
table both of those address that in
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
slightly different ways this amendment
 
01:49:47.790 --> 01:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
is um identical to representative
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
McKenzie's original bill um and while it
 
01:49:55.470 --> 01:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
will not result in um the change that we
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
would like um I just believe it's
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
important to shed light on this so that
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh going
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
forward um it'll be viewed as important
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
and something that we need to work on
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
early and effectively for the next uh
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
session um we also believe that the
 
01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
underlying bill is a good bill perhaps
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
not as important as the amendment but
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment's not going to happen um
 
01:50:23.790 --> 01:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure the underlying
 
01:50:28.030 --> 01:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
Bill does happen so um my my motion is
 
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
to adopt the amendment and um I ask
 
01:50:34.510 --> 01:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
people to support it to send a message
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
that improving the uh benefit table for
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment is uh is an important thing
 
01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative seaworth I find
 
01:50:46.030 --> 01:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
myself in an odd position I think I'm
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
going to agree with every single thing
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
that my fellow representative just said
 
01:50:52.069 --> 01:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
except that I'm going to vote the
 
01:50:54.669 --> 01:50:54.679 align:start position:0%
opposite of of how he asked me to and
 
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
the reason is exactly what he explained
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
I think it's very important knowing
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to this bill when
 
01:51:06.790 --> 01:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
it hits the floor that we have a um if
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
this is assuming this is going to be the
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
majority P report ought to pass with
 
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment we need a Minority Report that
 
01:51:16.069 --> 01:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
explains why uh when there's an issue
 
01:51:17.589 --> 01:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
with that we're going to go with a to
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
pass because I think we have a consensus
 
01:51:22.589 --> 01:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
around this table that the underlying
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
bill is also a good bill and and that
 
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
we whatever happens with the amendment
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
we want to see that other language uh
 
01:51:34.109 --> 01:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
move forward so I am going to vote
 
01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
against um the motion to amend and the
 
01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
motion if that passes the motion that
 
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
follows and I will be writing a Minority
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
Report um to pass uh Senate Bill 330 as
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
sent To Us by the Senate I expect to get
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
over it
 
01:51:53.599 --> 01:51:56.589 align:start position:0%
over it
representative

01:51:56.589 --> 01:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.910 --> 01:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
McKenzie uh first of all let me uh just
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
Express um how much I appreciate the
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
efforts of the Department of Employment
 
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
Security uh and to all the colleagues on
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
this committee who some of whom have
 
01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
never been uh have any um relationship
 
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
or understanding uh of how the
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment system works so I hope that
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation provided some insight
 
01:52:23.229 --> 01:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
into that uh
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
um that said I I would agree uh that
 
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
something is going to need to be done
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
2007 was last time you uh you got this
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
through got some things through uh but I
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
also you know for all those people uh
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
who were in this house uh for the
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people who were distributed
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
all throughout the state of New
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh at some point there's going
 
01:52:50.350 --> 01:52:50.360 align:start position:0%
to be a layoff in in your
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
community and you're going to to look
 
01:52:54.589 --> 01:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
people in the eye and when they ask you
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
so what is the unemployment benefit I'm
 
01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:52:59.470 --> 01:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
receive and you're going to have to be
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
honest with the metalit the same
 
01:53:05.470 --> 01:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
benefits you would have received back in
 
01:53:08.589 --> 01:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
2007 and I don't think that is a
 
01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:11.800 align:start position:0%
defendable position uh and I think it's
 
01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:15.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunate for workers who depend on
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
the unemployment system in some of the
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
worst times of their lives so uh so I
 
01:53:25.109 --> 01:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
I I understand where we're at in terms
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
of the environment that we're in and the
 
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
the what we're up against but I do think
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
that that uh this is a valuable um
 
01:53:35.950 --> 01:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
exercise that the discussion that we
 
01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
went through is valuable and there was
 
01:53:43.629 --> 01:53:43.639 align:start position:0%
$400 million in the unemployment trust
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
fund so most money I've ever seen in the
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust fund quite frankly in
 
01:53:50.910 --> 01:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
all the years I've been doing this so
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
we're in pretty good position and I just
 
01:53:54.669 --> 01:53:54.679 align:start position:0%
want to say one thing the system is not
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
going to go broke it's not going to go
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
bankrupt as might have been suggested if
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation would have pass my hope
 
01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:03.639 align:start position:0%
would be that I would uh if this does
 
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
not Prevail uh that I will start work on
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
it again and if I'm lucky enough to be
 
01:54:11.790 --> 01:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh elected and fortunate enough to be
 
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
back here that that uh we will start
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
this process all over again thank you Mr
 
01:54:16.239 --> 01:54:19.229 align:start position:0%
this process all over again thank you Mr
chair

01:54:19.229 --> 01:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair so there's a
 
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
lot of ISM of how the current
 
01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
unemployment system works and it seems
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
to me that the unemployment insurance
 
01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
industry is a strange one in that it's
 
01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
monopolized all the problems that we are
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
currently experiencing and all the
 
01:54:34.109 --> 01:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
desires that we have to improve the
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
unemployment system wouldn't be
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
necessary if we had a private sector
 
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
unemployment system like almost every
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
other insurance system scheme out there
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
uh the idea that the government needs to
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
monopolize the insurance industry for
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
unemployment I find to be absurd I do
 
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
not think that the government should be
 
01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:49.719 align:start position:0%
involved in the unemployment industry
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
whatsoever thank you
 
01:54:52.639 --> 01:54:53.950 align:start position:0%
whatsoever thank you
thank

01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
you represent schs Madam chair clerk
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
I'll take all those um I just want to
 
01:55:05.310 --> 01:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
add that I know some folks had expressed
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
a concern oh if will this uh encourage
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
people to stay on unemployment longer
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
and having been unemployed and having
 
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
been on New Hampshire uh unemployment
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
myself um once when I was laid off um I
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
will say that it's still under the rate
 
01:55:29.069 --> 01:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
of pay that you made when you were
 
01:55:32.350 --> 01:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
working so the best incentive of all is
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
that hardworking people who have earned
 
01:55:37.870 --> 01:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
the right to receive
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment uh are eager to get back to
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
work and I know that firsthand there's
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
nothing about being unemployed is that
 
01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:46.589 align:start position:0%
nothing about being unemployed is that
is

01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
encouraging you know um and I hope you
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
don't experience that but if you have
 
01:55:56.069 --> 01:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
you'll know that there's every incentive
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh inside
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
oneself uh to get a job and be off of
 
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
unemployment I say with all authority
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.709 --> 01:56:15.719 align:start position:0%
you the unemployment system is um an
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
amazing safety net for both the employee
 
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:20.350 align:start position:0%
amazing safety net for both the employee
and

01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
Society because it allows it individual
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
to have some replacement of their income
 
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
to not place the burden on on the the
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
rest of the government or or what have
 
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
you and well it may be a monopolistic
 
01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
thing and it may be one of these uh
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
things that some people think is kind of
 
01:56:41.470 --> 01:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
socialized um it has
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
worked and and and uh it's worked for
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
many friends of mine who called me
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and were complaining
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
why is the compensation so low and why
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
is it max out at um the $440,000 mark
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
and what have
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
you we do have $400 million almost 395
 
01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:05.719 align:start position:0%
whatever amongst friends million dollars
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't pass a smell test that we're
 
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
sitting on that kind of money and we
 
01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
can't make some changes since
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
2007 for those who maybe question what
 
01:57:19.149 --> 01:57:19.159 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan said about why
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's not going to pass is because it is
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
a f note and putting a fiscal note on a
 
01:57:25.629 --> 01:57:25.639 align:start position:0%
bill that comes over from the Senate
 
01:57:27.069 --> 01:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
that's not a fiscal note would need a
 
01:57:28.990 --> 01:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
suspension of the rules which would be
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
2/3 we all know we're not going to get
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
that okay so um this is where for the
 
01:57:38.350 --> 01:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
kids in from conquered High School this
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
is where politics comes in how do you
 
01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
make a
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
point that something needs to be done
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
that this may not be the right way to do
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
it um but at least making a point from
 
01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:54.069 align:start position:0%
it um but at least making a point from
the

01:57:54.069 --> 01:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:57.310 --> 01:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
committee at the same time it is
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for a committee to pass
 
01:58:00.159 --> 01:58:01.629 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for a committee to pass
something

01:58:01.629 --> 01:58:01.639 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
that we know is going to be uh ruled in
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know in a prop improper or whatever
 
01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
speaker so we play politics which is
 
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
fine minority leader and I have
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
agreed uh coincidentally we have a 10 N
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
Split here between individual ual
 
01:58:23.709 --> 01:58:23.719 align:start position:0%
between the party there have 10
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
Democrats and nine
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
Republicans so the the motion can pass
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
we know in the full
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
floor uh the amendment uh will be ruled
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
in appropriate and then we have the
 
01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
original 330 Senate Bill 330 coming over
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
from the Senate which I think everyone
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
is in agreement with or a vast majority
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
of agreement
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
with so unless I've gotten it wrong
 
01:58:47.310 --> 01:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan we're going to
 
01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
play a little bit of what we want to do
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
in utilizing Parliament procedure to get
 
01:58:56.350 --> 01:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
what we would like to have said and done
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
um to the best of all possibilities
 
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
here I would also say that I I would not
 
01:59:05.229 --> 01:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
make a motion to overrule the chair with
 
01:59:08.069 --> 01:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
regard with regard to the uh rejection
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the amendment I'm not I don't want to
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
waste the time of the uh um the house um
 
01:59:16.229 --> 01:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
I simply want to see this amendment go
 
01:59:18.109 --> 01:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
to the floor
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
and um meet its demise as is necessary
 
01:59:26.910 --> 01:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
so while I do support uh the the uh goal
 
01:59:29.189 --> 01:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
of the I do support the underlying bill
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
I do support the goal of the amendment
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate as chairman to uh
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
send something to my speaker that I know
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
he's going to find Germain so I will be
 
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
vot voting against it um support of the
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
concept and I think we all know how the
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
vote's going to come out so does
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:58.270 --> 01:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
okay so a motion on the floor is ought
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
to pass or the
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
amendment adopting
 
02:00:07.229 --> 02:00:07.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1865 H okay and has been moved
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%

02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
motion the um the underlying Bill s SP
 
02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
330 um is a good bill that's that is
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
going to save people from being denied
 
02:01:41.310 --> 02:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits um that was the
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard that essentially
 
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
people got caught in a trap with regard
 
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
to their um um the types of employment
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
they were they were seeking and uh
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
this will allow in this new environment
 
02:01:58.069 --> 02:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
we're living in with homework being um
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
far more common that if someone is
 
02:02:03.790 --> 02:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
exploring um working from home as a
 
02:02:06.669 --> 02:02:06.679 align:start position:0%
replacement for their um uh former
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
employment that that would not
 
02:02:11.069 --> 02:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
automatically uh cause them to be denied
 
02:02:13.629 --> 02:02:13.639 align:start position:0%
um unemployment benefits so I think it's
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's a good bill solves the problem and
 
02:02:20.109 --> 02:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
um uh I hope we can all support it for
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I concur with
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
that I I would also say that when I
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
first saw this language come over from
 
02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
the Senate I was a little nervous about
 
02:02:38.069 --> 02:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
it um the chairman just gave us some
 
02:02:40.589 --> 02:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
information on the last bill that a lot
 
02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
of times we don't like to push things to
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
rules we like to see the statute lay out
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
um what the Department's going to
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
enforce and so I initially had some uh
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
nervousness about this but hearing the
 
02:02:58.510 --> 02:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
details of it I now feel comfortable
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
the right now if you look at what the
 
02:03:05.709 --> 02:03:05.719 align:start position:0%
way the law is written if someone fills
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
out an application for unemployment and
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
they're asked are you available to work
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
outside the home and they check no it
 
02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter why they could have the
 
02:03:19.709 --> 02:03:19.719 align:start position:0%
best reason in the world and the law
 
02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
says that the department must must deny
 
02:03:25.390 --> 02:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
them unemployment and really that's what
 
02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
we're fixing if you're eligible for
 
02:03:30.270 --> 02:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment or let's say potentially
 
02:03:32.669 --> 02:03:32.679 align:start position:0%
eligible eligible the department will
 
02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
figure that out and work the details and
 
02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're used to doing that they
 
02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
have rules that do that they have people
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
that do that and what this bill in
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
essence really does is allows them to
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
use that
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
expertise um to deal with a situation
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
where someone is looking for uh work
 
02:03:54.549 --> 02:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
from home employment and on that now
 
02:03:56.910 --> 02:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
that I understand that I completely
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.350 --> 02:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to support the the bill
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
only because I cannot um support this
 
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
because I uh if all goes as we expect it
 
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
will I cannot stand up on the floor and
 
02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
support 3:30 if I'm voting against
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
it right now if we if the underlying
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
Bill if the amendment fails
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
right just wanted everyone to know why
 
02:04:28.030 --> 02:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be voting the way I am it
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
would be hypocritical for me to to not
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
um support the final bill even though I
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
don't agree with the amendment and then
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
if it comes to the floor and people say
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
well what are you guys doing what what
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
does all this mean I can at least stand
 
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
and say yes we support the underlying
 
02:04:46.589 --> 02:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
bill so I just want everyone to know
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
what I will be
 
02:04:53.629 --> 02:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:56.270 --> 02:04:56.280 align:start position:0%

basically a lot of the Committees um get
 
02:07:40.109 --> 02:07:40.119 align:start position:0%

have a um a a lunch a communal lunch
 
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
with the entire committee um we thought
 
02:07:48.270 --> 02:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
it would be important to uh get get our
 
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
business done so that no one will accuse
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
us of having um secret conversations
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
about uh bills um but um uh I thought we
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
might do it on the last day but um I've
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
got a grandbaby at home and I'm getting
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
over a cold so I don't not not a good
 
02:08:07.870 --> 02:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
date today but if we can find a date uh
 
02:08:10.109 --> 02:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
that would work for folks um I think it
 
02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
would be a great thing because um as has
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
been said um the labor committee is the
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
best committee so we should celebrate
 
02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:22.870 align:start position:0%
