subcommittee work session we'll start
 
00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
with uh Senate Bill
 
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
488 and
 
00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 align:start position:0%
um this was the
 
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
one about
 
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
um well there's two parts to it one is
 
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
it gives the Authority for uh the
 
00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
um I believe the board to Define their
 
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
continuing medical education
 
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and um as I understand
 
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
it and Doug can correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
um to initially become actually why
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't you come up yeah yeah to initially
 
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
become a uh PA they have to um have
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
passed a
 
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
test um from the nccap the uh National
 
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
Commission on certification good morning
 
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
we just started 488 Senate bill just
 
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
started just started right that um to
 
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
get their initial license they have to
 
00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 align:start position:0%
have passed the exam from the national
 
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
Commission on certification of
 
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.710 align:start position:0%
Commission on certification of
Physicians

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
Physicians
 
00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
assistance um which I'm guessing they
 
00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.550 align:start position:0%
assistance um which I'm guessing they
actually

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
um that means they're getting their
 
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
certification from them but they're not
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
required to maintain it assume the nccpa
 
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
has their own continuing requirements
 
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
education requirements if you're going
 
00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
to maintain certification but because
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
you don't have to um there needs to be
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
some other method of of defining what
 
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
the continuing education requirements
 
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
are and this directs the um the board to
 
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
do that through rul
 
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
making and that's uh am I correct in
 
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
that introduce yourself that's my
 
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of it yes sir just
 
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself for the oh sure uh
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
Douglas oer how general counsel oplc
 
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
okay um and then the second part is
 
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
another exception for the barberan
 
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
cosmetology for the Pas as it is there
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
for Physicians and and my understanding
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
in there is that like you know if you've
 
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
got a boil or some wound on your scalp
 
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
let's say and to treat it they've got to
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
cut the hair remove the hair around it
 
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
that's technically barbering so this
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
gives them an exception so they don't
 
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
have to go out and get a barbering
 
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
license to do it um and uh I had noticed
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
that there was um another part in
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
statute that had something to do with
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
continuing education and Doug has sent
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
us information indicating that that's
 
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
not a problem if you can just review
 
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
that for everybody
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
else and if anybody else has questions
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
or issues with this and before we do
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
that you have something
 
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.150 align:start position:0%
that you have something
represent

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
Moody thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's when they're preparing somebody for
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
surgery and if they have to remove the
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
hair why would Barber come into a
 
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
because if you read the barbering statue
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
to cut someone's hair you have to have a
 
00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 align:start position:0%
barbering license correct that's under
 
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
normal circumstance this is a medical
 
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
thing and they go to school for but
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
still currently on the way the statute's
 
00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
written technically the positions
 
00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
assistant would have to have a barbering
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
license this removes that it it's just
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that that's ridiculous
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
and is not
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
required because you know what's written
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
is written and those are the rules and
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and I think having thing having you
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
know legal requirements that aren't
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
enforced is not a good idea it can cause
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
problems and it's better just to clean
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
up the statute which is what this is
 
00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
agreed makes sense certainly uh
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh thank you Mr
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
chair um and represent of maputi under
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
under the statute 13 313
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
a25 those are exemptions to barbering so
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
it's exempting those people from the
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
license but Physicians assistants aren't
 
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
in that exemption list right now right I
 
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
I think my guess is when uh physicians
 
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
assistant you know when that was created
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
they neglected to add them as an
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
exception along with the Physicians and
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
this is just cleaning that up oh just a
 
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair uh repres yes yeah um
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
so the way I'm thinking through this is
 
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
there is a statue and physician
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
assistants were not included in that
 
00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 align:start position:0%
statue in the exception in the exception
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
to the statute that's there yes but they
 
00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:30.759 align:start position:0%
are regulated currently by by the
 
00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
medical board which the doctors surgeon
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
and nurses are exempt from that correct
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
right so isn't that part of
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
the reading if they are they're part of
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
that pack in creating that if I can
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
answer I mean you're you're talking
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
about you know I guess statutory
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
interpretation so how do the statutes
 
00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:00.759 align:start position:0%
get read and how do they interact
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
and I think the issue is the Board of
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
Medicine has no authority over the
 
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
practice of Barbering they the Board of
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
Medicine cannot provide an exception to
 
00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:12.759 align:start position:0%
the barbering statute right um just like
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
they can't create an exception to
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
Plumbing license or whatever and so
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's up to us and so if there's going
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
to you know yes it's silly to say they
 
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
have to have a barbering license but
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's the way the stat the way statu
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation the way you'd read the
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
statutes says they would have to have
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
that license that's a problem and this
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
is intended to fix it okay if that yes
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
there's no sense leaving a gray area
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
when we can fix it right right I mean
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
you know Prosecuting a PA for cutting
 
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
the hair on somebody's head to stitch up
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
a wound is not goingon to I mean you
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
know any prosecutor to Tred to do that
 
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
would be looked like an idiot but it's
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
still better to have the statutes be
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
correct uh representative G
 
00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:02.310 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
spill

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
spill
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
proof my question is why did this come
 
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.470 align:start position:0%
proof my question is why did this come
to

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh this came to good
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
question it's my fault I apologize um
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
this came to subcommittee because I saw
 
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.150 align:start position:0%
this came to subcommittee because I saw
in

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh 328 D colon one Roman 1- a already
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
had some language about continuing
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
education and I had a concern that
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
having it in statute and then also
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
giving the authority to the board might
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
cause a problem so I asked uh Mr
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
osterhout about that and he came back
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
and believes it's not a problem and I I
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
agree with that and I'm going to let ask
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
him to explain that and what I'm hoping
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
is if everybody's okay with that
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
explanation I am that we can uh just get
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
a motion for OTP on this and you know
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
move on y so Mr oud sure um I mean I
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
have the email in front of me yeah but
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not it was wasn't entirely clear to
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
me partly so if you could explain what
 
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
the thing
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
is uh so you asked me to look into the
 
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
definition that you identified what was
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
that 328 D1 uh Roman numeral 1 a yep uh
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
defines approved continuing Med medical
 
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
education activity we were concerned
 
00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:31.959 align:start position:0%
there was some conflicting language um
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'm basically just going to use my email
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
as an outline and explain it so um under
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine rules 60401 an
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
applicant for initial lure as a
 
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
physician assistant must submit as part
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the application documentation that
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
they've passed an initial examination
 
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
administered by the
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
nccpa um it may be confusing because I
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe the Gen Court website has
 
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
been updated yet and so if you go to the
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
oplc website you can find um the newest
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
rules adopted by the board and just to
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
put this out there that's true with any
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
of the boards if you ever I would always
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
do both and just cross reference the
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
most up to date are going to be on the
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
oplc website um so it looks to me like
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
there isn't actually a requirement to
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
hold nccpa certification but it might be
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
implicit in having passed the exam it I
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
said it doesn't appear relevant to this
 
00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
analysis uh maintaining certification
 
00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:35.959 align:start position:0%
was a requirement for renewal of
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
physician assistant lure under the old
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
Med 60801 B5 but is no longer required
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
for Renewal under the newly adopted Med
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
60801 so it was a requirement that they
 
00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
I understand that and that's the why
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed there there's more
 
00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:54.519 align:start position:0%
okay sorry carry on
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
sorry uh so so my opinion was I think
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
under I'm just I have to read because I
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
looked at this a month ago yeah I think
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
under the current statutory structure
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
the board can already and already has
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
set renewal requirements for Pas that
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
haven't maintained
 
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
nccpa uh 328 D1 which is where this all
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
started does give the board approved
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
continuing Med medical education
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
activity language but it also part of
 
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
that definition is any other board
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
approved activity so my response was
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
that I think everything is in place to
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
accomplish what s488 is trying to
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
accomplish as far as not requiring nccpa
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
certification for PA renewal and I don't
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
think that definition conflicts as it
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
pertains to CES other than
 
00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
nccpa okay so the board can come up with
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
whatever continu education requirement
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
they want regardless of 1A that's the
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
way I'm reading it yes sir okay any any
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
other question yeah represent M py uh
 
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.150 align:start position:0%
so my question is
NC

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
NC
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
AAP all the acronyms alphabet soup that
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
I have to memorize um but so that is the
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
national you start out with and that's
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
Universal for all states
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
correct uh because if you have a
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
national I'm just drawing a parallel
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
when I had the Asha certification
 
00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
American speech and hearing associ
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
iation certification for Speech
 
00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839 align:start position:0%
Pathology and ideology for a while
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
unless I had the CCC for ideology and
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
Speech Pathology I could not get any
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
license to any state Massachusetts New
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whatever so that was the
 
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
prerequisite and initially it started I
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
had to have license I mean certification
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
as well as the membership then it got so
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
expensive that they dropped the
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
membership you can be a non-member but
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
you still have the certification that
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
was the stamp of approval the national
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
level so you're saying with the
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
physician assistant that stamp of
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
approval at the national level is no
 
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
longer required to get the state
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
licenser it is required for initial lure
 
00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
it's not required to renew that license
 
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
so every two years you don't have to
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
pay H so is this done in other states I
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
that that that could come to bite you if
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh you're in a
 
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.829 align:start position:0%
uh you're in a
bardy

00:14:50.829 --> 00:14:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
professionally um any other comments or
 
00:14:54.509 --> 00:14:54.519 align:start position:0%
questions about this from the
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yes uh representative Brown
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair sorry I'm I may
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
have misunderstood
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
you what what you said a few minutes
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
ago that it wasn't in 1A that the board
 
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
has the authority to do any other board
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
approved activity but I'm seeing in onea
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
board as uh as the attorney said that or
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
any other board approved activities at
 
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.069 align:start position:0%
any other board approved activities at
the

00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
end no I'm not sure what my question is
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
about that I misunderstood what you said
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
I thought you said the opposite of that
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
no no I I just saw that there were some
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
specific things related to contining
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
education and we're giving the board
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
authority to Define them and um I just
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure there wasn't a
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
conflict and it appears there's not and
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
so I'm fine with the bill as is
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative G and then Mony thank you
 
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'd like to move off to pass on
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.269 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
488

00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
488
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
um well we'll get the motion in a second
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
then uh and then would someone like to
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
second I'll second I will second that
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
and uh um representative Gould on your
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
motion I think that um the explanation
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
we've gotten on any possible conflict's
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
been uh clear in that there's not a
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
conflict and that the board will be able
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
to handle whatever um rules it needs to
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
make okay U representative Brown you
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
want to comment on your
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
second uh uh no I think you covered it
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
thank you and the discussion
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
represent M py um my only question or
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
concern would be it's still the Pas are
 
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.509 align:start position:0%
concern would be it's still the Pas are
under

00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
Physicians rul making or Board of
 
00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
Medicine as the rulle making
 
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
and how would that
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
impact if the next one that's not you
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
know the one that passed the house in
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
terms of not
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
having supervision trying to
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
independently work
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
so there there there is a dichotomy
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's being created I I don't see that
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
I mean they're still under the Board of
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
Medicine uh just that specific
 
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
requirement was dropped but the Board of
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
Medicine will still have the authority
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
as I understand it to set their
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
continuing uh education requirements and
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh and dog do you have any comment on
 
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.590 align:start position:0%
uh and dog do you have any comment on
that

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind everybody that the
 
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
requirements already been removed
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
because the the rules went through the
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
rul making process and they were passed
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
at the jail car they've been adopted so
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
that that requirement is already gone to
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
remove the collaboration maintain the
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
certification oh certification correct
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
but I mean there's no conflict she was
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
talking about the continuing ad the
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement requirement and
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's a separate I think that's beyond
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
the scope of the continuing education
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
piece okay I would have to look at the
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
language I didn't I didn't look into
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
that for this yeah all right okay uh
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
representative gold as I recall in that
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
other Bill the physicians's assistance
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
if that bill passes will still have a
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
board supervising them one way or
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
another so that whatever board is
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
supervis medicine right and so that
 
00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:20.919 align:start position:0%
board would still handle their
 
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements that's
 
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
Bailey I was just wondering what this is
 
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
some section of exceptions or something
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
which part the I mean a through L must
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
be something right this is just a new
 
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph under some section I think
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
if I may I I've I've gone away from it
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
but it lists all those
 
00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
other uh others that are exempt from
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
that doctors and nurses she's talk she
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
he's talking about um the first section
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
the continuing education thing is an
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
m so that's in 28 d10 uh Roman
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
1 uh my guess is it's other things where
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
pad okay uh Roman went
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
so um it's the other stuff and there are
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
other areas where the uh board is G is
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh required actually to adopt rules so
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is just adding to the sort of rules
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
that the board is is required to uh
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
create and goes for rule making thank
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
you uh represent m one last question for
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
clarification if the
 
00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
doctors have the exception this would be
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
very similar to the doctor's exception
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
are talking about the barbering or
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
barbering and also the you know that
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
only Pas that are
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
in Surgical
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
well it's it's not a primary Family
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
Practice well it would be any PA it
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
would apply to I mean I mean this is
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
just off the top of my head just to
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
guess but I mean there might be reasons
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
other than surgery where they need to
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
remove the hair let's say you look like
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
you've got a serious uh skin problem and
 
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
they need to take a better look at it
 
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
have to remove their hair I don't know
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
if that's the case but any any reason
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
where they would have to remove hair as
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
part of providing whatever treatment
 
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
they're providing this would let them do
 
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.549 align:start position:0%
they're providing this would let them do
it

00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
do you you hang on so I mean I'm
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
following through the chain like yeah
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
dermat the position yeah the groups that
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
will come in uh contact or has to make
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
those decisions not
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
every every field in the doctor's uh I
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
mean in the medical field will have to
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
do that ER well Dermatology it all
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
depends it depends on the circumstances
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
of the case if it's a case where to
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
treat it properly they've got to remove
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
some hair then this allows them to do it
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get into the details
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
of when they can and can't remove
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
somebody's hair I don't no no no I'm not
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
saying we need to but I'm just saying if
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
it's already established for medical
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
field it shouldn't be difficult to
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
replicate or duplicate that rather than
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
trying to create another exemption this
 
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
isn't all if you read the language all
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
it takes is the existing language say
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
Physicians and surgeons licensed under
 
00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:30.029 align:start position:0%
Physicians and surgeons licensed under
RSA

00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
329 when engaged in the practice their
 
00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:34.039 align:start position:0%
profession that's an exception from the
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
barar and all it does is ADD and physici
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
assistance licensed under RSA 328 all it
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
is is expanding no the existing
 
00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
exception to Pas as well as what's
 
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
already there for others that's fine I
 
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
please yeah and and thank you Mr chair
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
so to follow up it I guess if it said
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
the the medical field that would be a
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
generic category that could include a
 
00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559 align:start position:0%
physicians assistant but they're all
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
very specific Physicians and surgeons
 
00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
chiropractors medical or surgical Office
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
of the uh Department of Defense nurses
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
morticians so it's very specific so
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't have a generic
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
category you'd have to make this a
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
specific addition right and then General
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
statutes have to be reasonably specific
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
because in the end if somebody were to
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
challenge them you know it's got to be
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
laid out so a court can you know come up
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
with the correct
 
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
interpretation and so you know saying
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
General things and and saying well you
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
know having that requirement wouldn't
 
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
make sense doesn't mean we don't need to
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
make it clear in in statute that the
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
requirement isn't there uh
 
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.630 align:start position:0%
requirement isn't there uh
representative

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
Bailey I I don't know if you find it
 
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
amusing or ironic that through this New
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would come up to the Middle
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
Ages and we we could have Barber
 
00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
surgeons um well it no actually not
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
because if when engag in the practice of
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
the profession which is being a physici
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
assistant and just doing General
 
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
barbering is not engaged in the practice
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
of profession their profession and
 
00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
therefore that the exception wouldn't
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
apply then so no we don't sorry that
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
could be a bill for next year uh and any
 
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.390 align:start position:0%
could be a bill for next year uh and any
other

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
discussion okay so we have a motion of
 
00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
ought to pass by repres G second by
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative Brown all in
 
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
favor anyone opposed and we got one two
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
three four five of us all right thank
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
you all right I'm going to close the
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work work session on Senate
 
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.630 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work work session on Senate
Bill

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
488 and uh once I get work next we're
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
um going to open the subcommittee work
 
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill
 
00:23:45.159 --> 00:23:46.830 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill
600

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
600
 
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
and just as a a a
 
00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
recap This was
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
um so there was the
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
um licensed pharmacy technicians which
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
was done recently in the last couple
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
years I
 
00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
think and um I guess the the idea the
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
point of this bill is that if they're
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
be um overseen by the pharmacy board
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
there ought to be
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
um you know they have ought to have
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
representation on the board and so what
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
the first part of this does is increase
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
the size of the pharmacy board from 5 to
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
seven members uh adds an additional
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
practicing pharmacist and adds a
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
um a pharmacy technician that's the
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
change to add that and then the part
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
that was uh and then down
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
below there's currently a requirement if
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
you look at it that the uh pharmacist
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
members the board shall have been
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
licensed pharmacist for at least 10
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
years and at the time of their
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
appointment practiced Pharmacy in the
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
state for at least 5 years but I guess
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
originally there was no requirement on
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
how long the pharmacy technician be
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
licensed and uh so this bill as I
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
understand it was put in for that
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
purpose it
 
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.590 align:start position:0%
purpose it
basically

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
um in effect duplicates that um but the
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
problem was when this was written the
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
bill was written it only listed uh
 
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
certified pharmacy technicians but since
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
there are also licensed pharmacy tech
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
technicians um you
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
know I think I think we need an
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that says uh licensed or
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
certified um and then as I recall there
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
was some discussion during the uh
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
hearing asking whether or not the
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
requirement of them being Li you know
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
being a pharmacy tech for 10 years and
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
in the state um for five years there was
 
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
concern that there might not be a large
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
enough pool
 
00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
uh because the pharmacy techs you know
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes go on to do other
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
things and um I asked uh Mr osterhout
 
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
about that and um he actually sent me a
 
00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
list of all the licens all the they're
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
not just licens or registered Pharmacy
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
tax of which there are
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
1674 total and there are 42 who've been
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state for over five
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
years and I also talked with the um the
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor of represent Merchant who is a
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
pharmacist I think he's on the board at
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
least he was I think he still is was um
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
and you know he doesn't believe there's
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
a any problem with the pool being large
 
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
enough that would meet that requirement
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
to have candidates on the board so uh
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
his recommendation was to leave the 10
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
and five and I'm okay with that so um
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm proposing is oh he
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
also wanted because of uh current
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
membership of the board and phasing it
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
over and the fact that the licensed
 
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
pharmacy tech that whole thing's new and
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
there's very few of them he wanted the
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
effective date change to January 1st of
 
00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.039 align:start position:0%
25 which again I don't have any problem
 
00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
with that and so you know
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
um I'll make a motion that we can have
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
discussion and my motion is that we make
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
those two changes one is um that it be
 
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
uh licensed or certified in uh on line
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
19 on page one and that we change the
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
effective date to January the 1st of
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
2025 so second okay and any uh
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
that yep represent M py thank you Mr
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
chair um I do like two things one is to
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
add the pharmacy technicians because
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
they are more in almost all uh
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
pharmacies now they are using pharmacy
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
technicians so they have the
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
representation the other one that's
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
interesting is the hospital pharmacist
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's a whole different um group of
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists so this I see line
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
three and one of whom shall be a
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
full-time Hospital pharmacist that's
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
that's existing language this bill does
 
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
not change that
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
okay and one so we are going from five
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
member board I mean yeah five member
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
four me five member board to seven in
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
general the uh yeah it's good to keep an
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
odd number so you don't get
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
ties and I guess the decision was made
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
to uh add one of both a pharmacist and
 
00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
then add the pharmacy technician and and
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
if I might in the original Bill Mr chair
 
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
it was six and somebody caught that and
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
changed it to seven oh the in the Senate
 
00:28:49.509 --> 00:28:49.519 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you one more followup
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
with that um is there a difference
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
between the time required for licensing
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
versus certification for f receive Tech
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how that's relevant but
 
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh I assume there's additional education
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
and exams and all that um dog if you he
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't he doesn't have the details but
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
okay but I would expect there would be
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
but I don't
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
discussion it's adding one pharmacist
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
and one pharmacy
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
technician I think I think the my guess
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
would be that uh you know they want to
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
keep a good majority of Pharmacists on
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
there um whereas if you added um two
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy texts it would be four and two
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
and at least the author of the
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh didn't think that was the way to
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
go the one
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
not the one the one being
 
00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:53.519 align:start position:0%
add only the
 
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
technician well they're already there
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
that's existing language they changing
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
right seven two right and and what
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
they're doing is they're they're they're
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
going from four practicing pharmacists
 
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
to five of them and they're adding one
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacy tech and that's the two yeah
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
but that only adds up to six 5 plus one
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
is six no no no no it's it's uh you're
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
you're having um no five it's four
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
instead of four members it's going up to
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
five no no it's going from 5 to
 
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
7 it's going from four pharmacists to
 
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.870 align:start position:0%
7 it's going from four pharmacists to
five

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists and then they're adding oh
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
and there's also a public member in
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
there okay that that's what it didn't
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
the numbers didn't make sense yeah
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
there's also a public member which stays
 
00:30:48.679 --> 00:30:49.509 align:start position:0%
there's also a public member which stays
the

00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:49.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
same any other discussion okay um so the
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
motion is to uh create uh an amendment
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
and I'll go down to Olas and arrange for
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
that um after this but to make um those
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
two changes to add the uh cert licensed
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
or certified on line 19 and to change
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
the effective date to January 1st 2025
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
all in favor I anyone opposed all right
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
now we need to have uh I'll make the
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
motion and that's um ought to pass with
 
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
that Amendment on the bill and I need a
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
second okay second
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
R um do we need any more I don't I'm not
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
going to say anything more about it I
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
think we've covered it representative
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
Gould anything nope I think you covered
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
it any other
 
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:45.799 align:start position:0%
discussion all right all in favor anyone
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
opposed no all right very good so we're
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
so you're going to get the amendment
 
00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and that would be a different
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
number we don't have that we don't have
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment um what'll happen is I'll
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
get that Amendment and I'll send it
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
around to the full committee and we will
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
deal with that next week on the 8th when
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
we exec the bill
 
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
so all right so I'm closing the
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on Senate Bill
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
600 and then I'm going to open the
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on Senate Bill
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
318 and it's actually the um the
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
non-gain amendment to that
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
um just as kind of an overview what
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
happened this
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
bill was I think uh on social work
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
compact originally the language is
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
identical to the house bill which we
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
already dealt
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
with and so um and if you
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
remember all the time some of us spent
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
1271 which changed a number of boards to
 
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
advisory and
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
merged um aboard and um also got rid of
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
the uh the pharmacy Tech
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
registration um you know there were
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
objections at the last minute to do
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
making some of those board's advisory
 
00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
boards and so that bill was interim
 
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
studied but um there wasn't oppos you
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
know there was support for at least some
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
of them and so what representative
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
Maguire did is she presumably talked
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
with other people came up with a set of
 
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
boards that there was hopefully General
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
agreement on moving to advisory and also
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
the uh you know merging the the massage
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
and the reflexology and that was at the
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
request of those two boards and they're
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
already advisory those two and then uh
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with the pharmacy technician
 
00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
issue and
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm I understand it what she asked OS
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
to do was take those sections from
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
1271 apply those sections of the
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed amendment to 1271 and
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
then create out of that non-main
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
amendment to Senate Bill
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
318 and
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
um I I asked I you know I figured ol
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully could do that correctly um and
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
I asked uh but just to be safe I asked
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh attorney aser how to verify that and
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
it turns out they did a uh I'll be kind
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
and say a really lousy job and um and he
 
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
and actually I'm going to hand some
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
things out here
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
so I've got um Doug's comments on that
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
here's I already gave you one so four no
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
I got them I I print a number of them
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
one two three
 
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
four oh no I've got
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
plenty I know but if you're interested
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
hand that down to her so these are uh
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
Glenn take one and pass along please I
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
think there's enough and that that's um
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know the input I got from
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
dug on that pass that one down you've
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
got one already and then I went through
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
it to make sure I understood them all
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
and kind of wrote up my uh my take on it
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
I had a few questions which I'm going to
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
ask Doug about and pass this this down
 
00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:14.390 align:start position:0%
ask Doug about and pass this this down
as

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
well and then if anybody needs it I do
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
of of the original 1271 the amendment we
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
came up with 12
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
1271 and the amendment to
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
318 there a short one uh the second one
 
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
go the amendment to
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
318 okay and if you want the other two
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
or anybody else wants them that's fine
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
okay so uh I'm going to work off the my
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
email back to
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
I think Doug if if uh I understand
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
correctly you're you're you indicated
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
there was the first one is one where I
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
didn't see what you apparently saw uh I
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
found the language in there later and
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
just didn't update my thing so we can
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
ignore the first bullet okay in my all
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
right and I'll go through the others for
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
people here and when there's questions
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
I'll get back to you on that and if
 
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
anybody has questions let me know
 
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
the second
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
bullet is um basically it's a situation
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.510 align:start position:0%
there was a
language

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
um either I don't remember it was either
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
in the bill or the amendment 1271 they
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
just left Parts out and so um 1271 as
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
amended um added a definition defining
 
00:36:56.349 --> 00:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh what what the board
 
00:36:59.470 --> 00:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
was uh the ne and the rest are
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
similar well almost all of them there's
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
bullet and um it's another case where
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
they left out um a definition of who the
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
executive director was and all of these
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
were either in 12 well they would have
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
been in 1271 as amended if we had done
 
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
that so they were either in 1271 or in
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment to it uh fourth bullet
 
00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.069 align:start position:0%
the amendment to it uh fourth bullet
item

00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
item is the same thing they left out
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
that whole section duties of the
 
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.550 align:start position:0%
that whole section duties of the
Advisory

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
Advisory
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
Board um the last bullet on that page
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
and then going into the next
 
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
page um this is getting to the nursing
 
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.349 align:start position:0%
page um this is getting to the nursing
home

00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
administrators and again it's a
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
definition that was uh that OLS left
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
out um this the um first bullet on that
 
00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.670 align:start position:0%
out um this the um first bullet on that
second

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
page um
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a whole section of uh
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
language that they just didn't carry
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
over to the
 
00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:06.390 align:start position:0%
over to the
amendment

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
um second bullet on that
 
00:38:10.119 --> 00:38:12.230 align:start position:0%
um second bullet on that
page

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
think so Doug on that one um maybe I was
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
wrong but I I didn't think what you
 
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
noted covered everything that needed to
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
be carried over but I may not have it
 
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
right we're on the second bullet of your
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
email on the second page all right so as
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
hb1 1271 as
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
proposed got a lot of documents floating
 
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
in front of me so yeah I know um page
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
34 on
 
00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:46.839 align:start position:0%
which section on the bill as introduced
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm following I'm just trying to get
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
be okay thank you are we here uh line uh

languages proposed on page 34 of we of
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%

00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
that which one the 127 one itself but I
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
amendment okay 318 you can pass this
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
I've got plenty okay good I had HCS
 
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
working on thank you than because I
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
thought this might get I was hoping we
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
would just uh say oh we approve it but
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
apparently says it's fine no no chck
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
double hey as as you recall when we were
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
coming up with the amendments to 1271 I
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
there's some things I didn't catch
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
so all right um
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
know so we're on as far as the second
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
bullet we're working off three documents
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
is actually what's going on so um what
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
Doug's talking about right now is hb1
 
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
1271 is introduced starting at page
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
34 and we have two different amendments
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
well one amendment is 318 which is the
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
the 1 to 38 1429 H uh correct okay not
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh okay 1248 H is the amendment to 1271
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
127 so what all what all us was supposed
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
to do is take things from the bill was
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
introduced particular
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
section apply the changes in
 
00:43:21.069 --> 00:43:21.079 align:start position:0%
1248 which was the amendment to that
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
bill and then create from that an
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
318 but they did not not
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
do yes definitely a lot of stuff got
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
actually thank you I I spent uh yeah
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
part of yesterday doing that so okay
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
you all right so I'm on page 34 of House
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
Bill 1271 as introduced section 72 yep
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
so the committee made some
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
um the language there makes
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
modifications to
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
15183 yeah then in the amendment to 1271
 
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
the March 20th
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment paragraph one was changed
 
00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
there so I think the intention is to
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
take you know you have the page where
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
that is so people I
 
00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:21.640 align:start position:0%
don't just I didn't write it down for
 
00:44:24.549 --> 00:44:24.559 align:start position:0%
some reason and that was the uh to on
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment to 1271 you're saying the
 
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to 1271 so there are no 3 page
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
34 in that no that's in the that's 34 in
 
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced yeah but where
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
the nursing home administrators were in
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment to
 
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
1271 yeah the problem is we're dealing
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
with three different um page 19 okay
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
actually if we can keep together on them
 
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
that'd be good yeah I didn't write down
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
the um so it's page
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
19 of the amendment to 1271 so I think I
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
think the intention is paragraph
 
00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
one R numeral one for 151 D Aon 3 what
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
line are we talking about should well
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about all of them now 22
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
line 22 22 22 okay so I think the
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
intention is we want the language of the
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
1271 and then two Roman Al 2 on as
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
introduced to be the language that ends
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
up in Sp
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
318 okay that's right including the uh
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
strikeouts and all that including the
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
strikeouts everything okay just so we
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
stay in sync on the amendment to
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
all I believe it was left out the whole
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
thing's out the whole thing's
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
out okay so we're not going to find it
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
probably all
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
right okay so
 
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
that's and if anybody has questions
 
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
about any of these let me
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
know um Mr chair uh represent G I have a
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
question you said um Roman numeral 2
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 in hb1 1271 as
 
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
introduced so it would be 151 d a colon
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
3 it's on page 34 line 20 line 20 CU we
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
modified all of the language to
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
15183 I just was so we just want to swap
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
out paragraph one for one I just wanted
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure I was on Roman numeral 2 in
 
00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:41.559 align:start position:0%
the right document yeah the point is the
 
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
1 yes yes on page 19 of the amendment to
 
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
22 20 starting at 20 really but great
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
that that was the langage that's Roman
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
one correct so we want to take basically
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
all of the section
 
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.910 align:start position:0%
all of the section
on

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
um all of
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
section I put it in my email 73 but it's
 
00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.069 align:start position:0%
section I put it in my email 73 but it's
actually

00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:47:20.079 --> 00:47:21.589 align:start position:0%
actually
70

00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
70
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
72 yeah it Ser I should have said 72 I
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
believe in my email on that
 
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
bullet um we're talking about bullet the
 
00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.309 align:start position:0%
bullet um we're talking about bullet the
second

00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
bullet but there's also
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
73 replacing section 73 with the nursing
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
was right on my second bullet I have 72
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
but then I when I got to looking at the
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
on the first
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
bullet first bullet dealt with section
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
one and then I got down to the second
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
bullet and I started looking at more and
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
I think I realized that um the problem
 
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.390 align:start position:0%
I think I realized that um the problem
was

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
larger and I think that in addition to
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
the problem with Section
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
72 I think they also missed
 
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.069 align:start position:0%
72 I think they also missed
73

00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
73
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
um which we needed and that's and then
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
they saw the amendment also addresses so
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
we need the original language then the
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
amended language for 73 is well I
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
believe um actually it is in it is in
 
00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:33.079 align:start position:0%
318 Amendment what page it is in 318
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment it's page five at the bottom
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
line 35 functions and duties of the
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board
 
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
um if I'm if I'm understanding
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
everything we're talking about see
 
00:48:44.319 --> 00:48:46.309 align:start position:0%
everything we're talking about see
that's

00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
um representative I have it identified
 
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
as in the 318 as well section 73 bottom
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
of page five uh section 13 of 38
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's what was in
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
73 compared the word yes and we're
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
including any Amendment from the
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to 12 correct so that that did
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
that did make it okay when I was trying
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
to dig through it it looked like there
 
00:49:13.789 --> 00:49:13.799 align:start position:0%
was a problem but I'm not
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
surprised okay so my comments
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
second the my my latter comments about
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
section 73 are not correct which I'm
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
perfectly willing to believe but you had
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh but what you had there was the issue
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
two um and the
 
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
issue so is the issue with section two
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
that that's it's not in 318 Amendment
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
not in 318s Amendment so this has to be
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
added all right and just to let people
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
know what to try and make
 
00:49:56.349 --> 00:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
sure we get the right thing out of OLS
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
this time um my plan is to take a copy
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
of uh the 318 Amendment and edit it with
 
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
the changes were you know they're on the
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
sheet that we talk about
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
today and then send it to Olas and also
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
send it out to everybody here so yep I
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
represent M py yeah thank you I just
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
have a fundamental question in terms of
 
00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
how line
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
35 which document uh
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to HB
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
1271 page 19 page 19 Y Line 35 and it
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
goes into office of professional lure
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
and certification in consultation with
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
the board and if you go up the same page
 
00:50:52.789 --> 00:50:52.799 align:start position:0%
yes um to provide say line what uh line
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
22 yeah um
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
implementation of this chapter shall be
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
transferred to the executive director of
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
The Office of professional licensure and
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
certification um wasn't that like it was
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
given to the office of professional lure
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
and certification not to
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
individual um in that
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
office wasn't that that that still is a
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
conflict I feel I might may not be
 
00:51:30.789 --> 00:51:30.799 align:start position:0%
looking at I don't know I what do we end
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
up where do we end up I I mean
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
technically I think Lindsay testified
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
that you have to assign the
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to an individual which is
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
why executive director is probably true
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
but I will or more accurate but I will
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
say as an executive branch attorney I
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
don't think I don't think there's any
 
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
confusion if if the responsibility is
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
assigned to the office I think that kind
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
of trickles down to the executive
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
director and trickles down further to
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
their designes so while one may be more
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
correct than the other I I think we're
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
okay with whatever you land
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
on so just to clarify the whole
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
discussion during the entire uh
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee at
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
1271 was you know this is a much broader
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
than one individual and that was that's
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
what my recollection is if it's not
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
accurate that's fine but that's what I
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
want to make we went we went back and
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
forth on that um I think the way things
 
00:52:35.549 --> 00:52:35.559 align:start position:0%
are interpreted if it's assigned to the
 
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
executive director that doesn't mean
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
they have to do the work because they're
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
in charge they can have anybody in the
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
department in the office do the work but
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
they're responsible to make sure it gets
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
done is what I recall represent gou
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair even though to me
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
this this whole debate is potatoes and
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
potatoes the the office seems to be what
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
will draw the least criticism and so my
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be to just change
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
it to the office and move on in the
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean I don't I personally I
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
have no opinion on this okay so um so
 
00:53:14.789 --> 00:53:14.799 align:start position:0%
what you're asking is that we change it
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
to uh transfer
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
to uh the office of and so I the
 
00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:23.559 align:start position:0%
executive director of would go away yeah
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
all right just for consistency's sake
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
okay fine represent Brown thank you Mr
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
chair it would be nice if this would
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
match all the other things we changed in
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
in language I think that's the
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
conversation we had we're trying to make
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
each one of these laws have the same
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
words in them for consistency so I
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
forget where we ended up I thought um I
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
think we ended up here and here kind of
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
right yeah I
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
mean if we catch ones here I I really
 
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
personally don't want to go through and
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
try and find everyone again again no uh
 
00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
at this point but um I have no objection
 
00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839 align:start position:0%
either way so I'm I'm fine making that
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
change so just just so that you know
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's what my notes kept saying that
 
00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
was my little pet peeve from day one in
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
terms of uh
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
1271 and uh that was kind of debated
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
heartly debated yep and the consistency
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
was arrived at that all right that's
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
fine okay great thank you okay on page
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
two of my email the third and last
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
bullet um which is uh this one is I CL
 
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
got a number of sections so the first
 
00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:43.270 align:start position:0%
got a number of sections so the first
one

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
um so there was a line in effect a line
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
left out about repealing RSA 151
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
and that and that's
 
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.510 align:start position:0%
and that and that's
from

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
um that's that's correct there was some
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
technical language that was in the hb1
 
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
1271 amendment that did not make it to
 
00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
318 what page was that um it would have
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
79 okay that's right it's it's technical
 
00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:24.039 align:start position:0%
clean up kind of so yeah so that's uh
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
language page 21 of the
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.079 --> 00:55:38.069 align:start position:0%
 
22

00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay um I do I think you
 
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
may I put 20 through 28 just for the
 
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
renumeration language as
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
well okay that's missing is well
 
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
actually I I dealt with that uh the next
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
one oh okay down um Tony I don't think
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
the renumeration I think that can go
 
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
away entirely because we're we're
 
00:56:03.789 --> 00:56:03.799 align:start position:0%
getting rid of every that's only related
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
to the registration medical technician
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
that whole part we're going to get rid
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
of correct because which I'll talk with
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
people because the Senate's dealing with
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
that so I think the second sub bullet
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
under that last main bullet there on my
 
00:56:19.599 --> 00:56:22.069 align:start position:0%
under that last main bullet there on my
email

00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
email
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
um I indicated that I don't
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
think um
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
the whole 888999 all that stuff I think
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
can go away I agree with that I don't
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.710 align:start position:0%
 
gets

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
right yep okay so that's fine I'm going
 
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
to the next page the last page of my
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
two bullets the first one if you look
 
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
back at um at Doug's original
 
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.990 align:start position:0%
back at um at Doug's original
document

00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.190 align:start position:0%
document
um

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
page the heck is that uh page
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
243 oh
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
no oh wrong wrong document too many
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
page right uh is that right there was a
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
whole big chunk of text that was left
 
00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.950 align:start position:0%
whole big chunk of text that was left
out

00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
um related to combining the two advisory
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
boards so that was just
 
00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
completely they included a little bit
 
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
out so um thank you for catching
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
that um and then the last one is
 
00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.829 align:start position:0%
that um and then the last one is
um

00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:22.839 align:start position:0%
318 uh be 318 page
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.309 --> 00:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
this so what what section and if you
 
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
look at the last page of the amendment
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
to 318
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
um 24 to 25 that's got to do with um
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the registration of
 
00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:04.589 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the registration of
medical

00:59:04.589 --> 00:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
technicians um which we did in House
 
00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:10.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 1410 but more on that in a minute
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
24 remove 328i which defined the medical
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
technicians removed it from the list and
 
00:59:21.069 --> 00:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
then uh 25 repealed it basically and
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
things that related to it U but what's
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
happened in the Senate I introduced that
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
bill to the Senate
 
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Carson wasn't happy with
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the medical technicians
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
she worked with
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
oplc and they uh they came then the
 
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
problem if people remember there was
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
that um none of the medical technicians
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
well one at one time were interested in
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
serving on the board so they never had a
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
quorum so they never made rules so oplc
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
could never do anything and so the the
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
amendment I think that Senator Carson is
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
proposing would uh get rid of the board
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
and transfer for the Authority for
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
registering and disciplining and all
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
that medical technicians to the
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
office that's am I my understanding
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
correct that's accurate okay and
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
therefore if that's gonna that bill is
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
already changing this area so we should
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
pull that out of uh the amendment to
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 318 so there's not a
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
conflict so okay which which bill is
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
changing that sorry uh there's 1410
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1410 which um passed this
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
committee and pass the house the Full
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
House it then went to the Senate and the
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
Senate is looking at um is planning to
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
amend that okay got it to change how
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
medical technician registration is
 
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
handled to instead of having a board
 
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
just have the office do it since they
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
can't get anyone to serve on the board
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
so take and So to avoid a conflict we
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
need to remove anything referring to
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
that from the amendment to Senate Bill
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
318 which are sections uh uh 24 and 25
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh represent M py
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
yeah um question is in terms that was
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
completely eliminated in 127 121 1310
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
correct 1410 Y and uh because was also
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
if I under remember correctly medical
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
technici comes
 
01:01:22.039 --> 01:01:24.470 align:start position:0%
technici comes
under

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
LNA of
 
01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:29.799 align:start position:0%
licensing there's no separate licensing
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
they are not licensed at all it was just
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
registration yeah but the rules on the
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
way the the thing was set up originally
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
the there was a board created that would
 
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
do rul making to do things like what are
 
01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
their requirements to be registered and
 
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
they would handle uh adjudication on any
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues and things like that
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
but for them to do Ru making they need a
 
01:01:53.789 --> 01:01:53.799 align:start position:0%
quorum and since they couldn't get
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
people to serve on the board and never
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
had a quorum there were no rules and if
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
there were no rules then oplc couldn't
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
enforce anything so also wasn't that
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
during that discussion was you know
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's no field called medical
 
01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:10.839 align:start position:0%
technician that was the quandry that the
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
whole thing was they didn't view
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
themselves as a profession therefore
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
that apparently because of that they
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
weren't interested in serving on a board
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore the whole scheme didn't
 
01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
work and so the Senate's looking at
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
changing it to get rid of the whole
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
board structure to have oplc handle the
 
01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
registration and any complaints directly
 
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
and to give
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
oplc the rulle making authority to make
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
rules with regard to that so just a
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
another one quick followup with that one
 
01:02:44.269 --> 01:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
is this was very specific instance what
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
happened in exitor hospital with uh
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
right uh and to not have that happen
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
again in our state was this was I
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
believe that was was uh Senator Sherman
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
who pushed that through he was involved
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
in that situation and some of his
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
patients or people he ended up
 
01:03:02.599 --> 01:03:04.390 align:start position:0%
patients or people he ended up
treating

01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
treating
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
um and so he was behind the creation of
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
it unfortunately the method you know the
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
scheme they came up with turned out not
 
01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
to work and it needs to be changed and
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
and uh you know whether whether the
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
registration is a necessary or whether
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
my whether the registration would fix
 
01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
the original problem I have questioned
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to you know that's not
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
this for House Bill 1410 removed it
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
entirely as part of
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
1410 well because house housef 1410
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
passed the house it does not pass the
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
Senate and because the Senate is decided
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
they don't they want to do it
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
differently their intent is to amend
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
1410 to move the authority from a board
 
01:03:49.279 --> 01:03:49.910 align:start position:0%
1410 to move the authority from a board
to

01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
oplc I don't have any big objection to
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
that and as I let them know and uh so so
 
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
assuming that's the only change they
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
make to
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
1410 then presumably they'll pass it
 
01:04:02.829 --> 01:04:02.839 align:start position:0%
that way and it'll come back to the
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
house and we'll probably Concur and and
 
01:04:08.269 --> 01:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
that's how it'll be handled is my my
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
prediction so in the Senate Bill there
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
there is no Senate bill on the Senate is
 
01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
going looking at amending the house bill
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
okay so why is 118 I mean 318 I'm sorry
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
we're replacing the entire 318 so the
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
original 318 is not
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
relevant but the amendment to 318 we're
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
using 318 as a vehicle to pass part of
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
what was originally 127 yeah is what's
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
going on and
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
so um when they wrote this amendment we
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
didn't know the Senate was going to do
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do and so they
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
included in here the um the repeal of
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
medical technician registration in this
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
but we don't want it here anymore
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
because this would conflict with what
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate is trying to do which which
 
01:05:05.549 --> 01:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
would cause pointless trouble so when I
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
so what I'm planning on doing is the
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
stuff we've discuss Chang we've
 
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
discussed I'll edit 318 the amendment to
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
318 sorry and send it back to all us and
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
what I will as part of that I will
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
completely remove sections 24 and
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
25 okay because this this because I
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeal something the
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
Senate's going to change okay that would
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
problematic that wouldn't make sense
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
right good
 
01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:37.630 align:start position:0%
sign uh I don't want to go
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:39.150 align:start position:0%
sign uh I don't want to go
[Laughter]

01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
there and then Senator Carson would hate
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
me more than she does
 
01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
but she's my Senator I joke around with
 
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
her um okay
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
so any actually how about this I'm going
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
to I'm going to I'd like I'll make a
 
01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
motion and then we can have further
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
discussion if people want and that is um
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
um that I'll come I'll take what we've
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
discussed here I'll create it um I'll
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
change the amendment to 318 to go along
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
with what we agreed to I will send it
 
01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
out to
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
everybody um I think there's enough
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
time I don't know if I'll get it done
 
01:06:23.069 --> 01:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
today because I got a stuff for tomorrow
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
but um and then we got session
 
01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
I'll create it and I'll send it off to

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
over uh hopefully I'll get it right but
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
if not then I'll I'll have all us do an
 
01:06:37.119 --> 01:06:38.190 align:start position:0%
if not then I'll I'll have all us do an

all in favor of uh what we just

discussed anyone opposed
 
01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
and then I guess
 
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.829 align:start position:0%
and then I guess
formally

01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
formally
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%

01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
otpa sure on the result of it G I don't
 
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:39.400 align:start position:0%

beat me to
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%

subcommittee um so my intent is to put
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
together at least a a proposed amendment
 
01:09:57.719 --> 01:09:58.709 align:start position:0%

to

01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
440 and I will try and send it out not
 
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:03.800 align:start position:0%

future but I'm hoping we'll come up with
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
a uh an amendment we agree on to 440 and
 
01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:32.480 align:start position:0%

01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
pass with such an amendment and then
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%

01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
it I'm not going to tell you you're not
 
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.430 align:start position:0%
it I'm not going to tell you you're not
allowed

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
to look at it no it makes sense in what
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
it saying so that's why right but but I
 
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
will I will send something else out okay
 
01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.430 align:start position:0%
will I will send something else out okay
um

01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
that Amed by it was your testimony on
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
the 22nd and it had the amendment Lang
 
01:11:39.679 --> 01:11:40.910 align:start position:0%
the 22nd and it had the amendment Lang
proposed

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
amendment after that yes all right so
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
purely clean up um yeah I think I think
 
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
the deal is this I think the Lang yeah
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's you're you're uh bring it's
 
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
coming back um so I think the deal is is
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
that oplc found some technical issues
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
with 440 and so what they're proposing
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
is that fix that's not what I've been
 
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
talking with with uh uh you know with uh
 
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
representative groa or or Maguire anyone
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
else but I think you know we'll look at
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
that and if it looks I haven't looked I
 
01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
haven't l i saw what it was that it was
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
a technical correction I haven't looked
 
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
at it in detail but assuming the
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is fine with it we'll add
 
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
that into what other other Amendment we
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
come up with for um I don't know about
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
