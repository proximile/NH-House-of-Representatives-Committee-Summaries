00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
councelor I do have a question for you
 
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
before we begin uh do you think that the
 
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 align:start position:0%
quality of Law and Order has gone down
 
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.550 align:start position:0%
quality of Law and Order has gone down
this

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
season I have to confess that I haven't
 
00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 align:start position:0%
been watching uh I'm not invested in the
 
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
characters anymore is this an Alfred
 
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
play a noo play uh you know it's just
 
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's not the people I know and grew up
 
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
with on law order I want to watch it for
 
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
30 years and have the same people like
 
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 align:start position:0%
General Hospital uh so I did you have
 
00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters I I have brothers
 
00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
okay so your response was what my wife
 
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
refers to uh in in me uh since I have uh
 
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
OCS only child syndrome oh if I want it
 
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
it should be that way but I agree with
 
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
you on this one all right I didn't know
 
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
yeah I can neither confirm nor
 
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
thing you
 
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.509 align:start position:0%
thing you
ready

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
go open the committee meeting on the
 
00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
special committee on the Family Division
 
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
of the circuit court and this will be
 
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
our last meeting together um in this
 
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
term maybe whoever a speaker next time
 
00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
will choose to reup it I know some of us
 
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
think that would be a good idea and
 
00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
maybe it'll happen we have three
 
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that met in calendar
 
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
2024 to continue the work that we did in
 
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
2023 you should have before you a
 
00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 align:start position:0%
report of the subcommittee looking at
 
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
court communication was chaired by
 
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative Greg who sends her
 
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
regrets she's not feeling well today and
 
00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
with representative ball who is uh
 
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
filling in presently as
 
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
Clerk and the committee members met
 
00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
informally via Zoom with uh attorney
 
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
Erin krian from the courts uh you have
 
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
your report in front of you we reviewed
 
00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 align:start position:0%
the case to tals that with a catalyst
 
00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 align:start position:0%
for the committee Miss KGAN informed the
 
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
committee that because this case was
 
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
brought up in the special committee's
 
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
last meeting the courts have already
 
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
started to examine their Communications
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
and where improvements need to be made
 
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
let me say parenthetically as the chair
 
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
it has been a delight to work with the
 
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
courts they monitor what we do we came
 
00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
in with the attitude of wanting to gang
 
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
up with the courts against problems and
 
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
not gang up against the courts which had
 
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
been done in some previous iterations of
 
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
this committee and as a result the
 
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
courts would hear things and say hey the
 
00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 align:start position:0%
outside set of eyes uh are on to
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
something here let's go for it and
 
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative Greg is two for two in
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
not really having to do a heck of a lot
 
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
to convince because the courts were just
 
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
already convinced I think it's because
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
she she got named chair of both of those
 
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittees but that's an open
 
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
question while the particular case was
 
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
in the family courts their work on this
 
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
is included the entire court system at
 
00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court level they have
 
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
implemented a pilot program to include
 
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
direct texts with information about
 
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
court cases and you may have seen in the
 
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
news recently where the Supreme Court
 
00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
chief justice has made a public
 
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
statement saying if you have anything
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
you need to talk with us about please
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
we're we're open we want to listen to
 
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
you uh back to the report at the circuit
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
court level they are working on a study
 
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
that includes how they handle motions
 
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
which can number in the thousands with
 
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
lengthy cases to see how best to deliver
 
00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
Communications they are looking at a
 
00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 align:start position:0%
possible change to rule 5.3 that would
 
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
ensure the delivery of new motions filed
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
attorney krian expects the study to take
 
00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:30.790 align:start position:0%
attorney krian expects the study to take
three

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
months representative ball and I are
 
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
satisfied that the courts are aware of
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
and working to remedy the issue brought
 
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
to the committee we left the meeting
 
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
with an understanding that we would have
 
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
future corresponden from attorney KGAN
 
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
with the study results in their
 
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
Solutions there's the report anybody
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
con I guess my concern is I want to I'm
 
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
curious as to how this will be
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the final report of
 
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
this committee since our charge is the
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
family court
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
not not um any other court
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh in in the Hampshire and
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me I think we should be
 
00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.150 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me I think we should be
focused

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
focused
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
on the family court in the work that we
 
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.510 align:start position:0%
on the family court in the work that we
eventually

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
submit to the
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
legislature am I being stuffy and
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned I do not take oldfashioned
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
as a negative term stuffy is
 
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.510 align:start position:0%
as a negative term stuffy is
a

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
tossup I understand that but um I'm not
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
really the one to address those things
 
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 align:start position:0%
in the negative myself I would say it's
 
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
more than we need but it is adequate to
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
what we need that in saying it was in
 
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
the Family Court it is wider includes us
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
and since this is the report of the
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee seeing no factual uh errors
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
or anything I would want us to includ
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:03.879 align:start position:0%
krian good morning Aon krian general
 
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
counsel for the court system uh we did
 
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
we did a review of all of the courts so
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
I that this the Supreme Court finished
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
its review the Superior Court finished
 
00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:12.759 align:start position:0%
we're still going through the circuit
 
00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:16.039 align:start position:0%
court because there are a lot of motions
 
00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
um to see if there's anything that we
 
00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
think we need to adjust we did do a
 
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
training in the last week for all judges
 
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
all clerks on this case as a case study
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
to particularly flag this issue um the
 
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
issue that we were thinking is that
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
parenting CL cases close and then to
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
reopen them the person serves them again
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
so they know that the case is reopened
 
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
but in a guardianship it stays open
 
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
guardianship of a minor child um and
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
there's an annual report that's filed
 
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
and so what appears to have been the the
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
constituent experience is that a a
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
motion to terminate the guardianship was
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
filed and she did not get it didn't know
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
that it was coming didn't expect it um
 
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't happen typically in a
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
parenting case because there would be
 
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
that service that reopen opens the case
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
so what we were trying to look for is
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
another case like another instance where
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
that could happen that a case is
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
particularly long lived because it
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
involves for example the time that a
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
person's a child 18 years um that
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
something could be missed like that and
 
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
whether there was a change we need to
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
make but at a minimum we have trained
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
everyone on this particular issue
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
flagging motions to terminate
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
guardianship even without a rule change
 
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that set of facts would
 
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
recur okay now follow up five minut
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
um so was was there conversation on uh
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
reporting to whether it's children of
 
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959 align:start position:0%
family law I would assume um our review
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
was broader because whenever someone
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
raises that that there's a problem I
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
think we always want to see if there's a
 
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
bigger problem essentially so we did
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
look more broadly not necessarily
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
because the committee asked us to
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
because we thought there could be other
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
longlived cases where this could happen
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
um but to respond to the question that
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
was posed you know guardianship of a
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
minor child happens in the Family
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
Division it's certainly within your
 
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um you know the the change
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
that we're thinking of making the
 
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
training that we've done is responsive
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
to the subcommittee which is within your
 
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction but could we decide we need
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
to make changes with guardianship of
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
adults in the Probate Court as a result
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
of this criticism or this this feedback
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
I think potentially but that wouldn't be
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
because the legislators were moving
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
outside of the the goal of um making
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
positive change in the Family Division
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
it would just be us learning uh that
 
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
there's potentially improvements to make
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
elsewhere great thank
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
you Vice chair
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
Smith thank thank you for recognizing me
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman um could any of the
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
potential problem be related to the fact
 
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
that the court is not following the
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
rsas that um specify basically one one
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
judge I
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
don't well the the the statute that
 
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
forms the Circuit Court establishes the
 
00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
goal of one Court one judge but I think
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
even in the language there's
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that that is the intention
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
but there will probably be some
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
logistical challenges that come up
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
people will retire for example um you
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
know we may not be able to have one
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
judge one one family for um an 18-year
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
parenting case that that there just may
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
be logistical challenges with doing that
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't know that I see how that
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
comes into this particular issue which
 
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
was that a litigant did not have
 
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
information um I certainly think well-
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
trained and experienced judges are
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
always on the lookout for gaps in the
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
system or issues um the more we train
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
and prepare judges the more experience
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
they get the better they will be and the
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
longer they have experience in this area
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
but I'm not I I don't want to fail to
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
understand your question but I'm not
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
apprehending it a direct
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
connection thank you okay yeah good
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
would it be your testimony that
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
the uh law
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
itself speaks to the necessity sometimes
 
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
of wiggle room that is to say it is
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
aspirational it is our lofty goal to do
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
this but the law doesn't mandate I.E
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
judge Jones retires but there's this
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
still case pending he cannot retire
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
until this case is done uh the law
 
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
recognizes itself that there will be
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
mitigating circumstances is that your
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
teston it it sets a goal of one judge
 
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
one family and we certainly have that
 
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
goal because judges become very invested
 
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
in the families that they serve and it's
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
generally good I think you see
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
particularly in smaller cour houses that
 
00:12:58.189 --> 00:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
the judge sees everything that might be
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
the only judge that sits there they see
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
the parenting case they see the criminal
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
case where they see the a DV case they
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
see all the connections in the community
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
of what's going on we can't necessarily
 
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
have that in every Court some courts are
 
00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:10.839 align:start position:0%
larger than others but the more the
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
judge knows about what's going on with
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
the family uh you know what's going on
 
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
in the community the more effective they
 
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
are so it's certainly the judge's
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
preference as well to to stay with the
 
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
same cases follow up it would be then
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
your testimony that in your opinion the
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
judicial system is not actually in
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
breach of the law here
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
the law is a
 
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
goal as opposed to a mandate which could
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
be disobeyed perhaps but it is not
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
disobeyed here it is the best we can do
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
it is our goal and if we don't do it it
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
is not actually in breach of the law as
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
written is that your testimony it it is
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely not Our intention to violate
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
any law but we run into other laws
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
there's a mandatory retirement age for
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
judges that was a leading
 
00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
question and and I'm answering it with a
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
speaking answer answer but there are
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
other laws that were Bound by for
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
example mandatory retirement ages for
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
judges so we don't have um flexibility
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
on every point but we we certainly
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to honor the spirit the
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
legislature has determined that that is
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
policy it is a good uh reasonable ask
 
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
that we want to implement but there are
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
logistical challenges any questions from
 
00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:19.959 align:start position:0%
other committee Members
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
First seeing none Vice chair Smith thank
 
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
you I I don't want to get into
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
um a debate
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
with my colleagues or with the council
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
but I think using the um issue of
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
mandatory retirement age as your uh
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
explanation might not be totally
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
accurate um in that there would be few
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
if any cases where the
 
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
reason that um there is more than one
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
judge is because of mandatory retirement
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
age much more likely I think and much
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
more frequent is
 
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
um are many other reasons including
 
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
dockets and assignments to more than one
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
Court um and other decisions that are
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
made without regard to what I would hope
 
00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
would be a guiding principle of of
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
one one case one judge but
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
um as I say I don't want to get into a
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
debate about that well you're you're
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
certainly right representative there are
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
many issues that that example I give
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
simply because it is a constitutional
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
mandate so it is not something we can
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
countermand but you're right there are
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
many other logistical challenges that we
 
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
have in particular training and bringing
 
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
up to speed a large number of new judges
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
has meant shifting some Personnel around
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
from different courts
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
um some judges start in Manchester so
 
00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:02.759 align:start position:0%
they can be near other judges and get
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
more experience so you're right that's
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
certainly not the only challenge there
 
00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:07.910 align:start position:0%
certainly not the only challenge there
are

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:10.519 align:start position:0%
many anyone
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
else once again a leading question
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
um as I read and the committee members
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
are looking at the um report from
 
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.790 align:start position:0%
are looking at the um report from
representative

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
Greg uh that indicates the courts are
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
looking widely and not just at Family
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
Court is it your um testimony that while
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
the courts may be looking more broadly
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
than at Family Division they are not
 
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
neglecting looking at Family Division
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
therefore this report answers the charge
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
that I gave the subcommittee to examine
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
this issue I will I will leave the
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
question of uh of the legislative charge
 
00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
but we are absolutely evaluating the
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
Family Division large number of
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigant appear appear
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
there we want to make sure that um the
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
system is working for them there but
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
there are certainly lessons from other
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
case types for example we're starting a
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
pilot program very shortly to use text
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
messaging notification in criminal cases
 
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
in uh Rockingham County if that's
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
successful we would potentially broaden
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
that to other areas so we we do have a
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
little bit of cross-learning from
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
different case types thank you so much
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn if you could pass
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
report I mean there were extras and they
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
must have landed in front of you so if
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
have the stash back and I will deposit
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%

place later but um that's what where
 
00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
what's going to go now I open um look at
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee on perjury
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative former Chief Justice Lynn
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
chaired this with a number of people I
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
was privileged to sit in on it uh
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn would you give us an
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
overview of your report please sure um
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
basically um the issue was um
 
00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
problem uh of of perjury in family law
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
cases uh and what are the remedies for
 
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
that and um based upon the information
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
we received during the the hearing on
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
this matter it appears that there are
 
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:36.039 align:start position:0%
ample remedies
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
available uh for perjury and for lesser
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
uh offenses and in fact um based upon
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony of Mr valard uh an
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General who has
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
Decades of experience as uh the county
 
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
attorney and previously an assistant
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
County attorney in straford county and I
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
I would add probably one of the most
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
respected uh County attorneys in the
 
00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.669 align:start position:0%
respected uh County attorneys in the
state

00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
um he indicates that that you know that
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
that perjury is something that is uh is
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
is prosecuted regularly including uh uh
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
in some cases uh arising out of family
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
law uh situations and he and he also
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think importantly that um
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
perjury uh the basis of perjury claims
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh May uh may be not only a referral
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
from the attorney general's office or a
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutor um but also from people who
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
are involved in family law cases um I
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
think he indicated that there were at
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
least uh some cases that he was aware of
 
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
where a referral had been made by a
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
litigant or perhaps a witness or
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
something in a family law case that
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately resulted in uh a perjury
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
prosecution he also emphasized however
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
that uh both perjury and even the Lesser
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh misdemeanor level offenses
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
involving false statements um are not
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
easy cases to prove there has to be uh
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
proof that a false statement was made
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
that it was made knowingly that it was
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
made without
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
believing uh that the that the statement
 
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
was true uh and that it was something
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
that that was not sort of Simply a you
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
know a mistake or a misperception or an
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
opinion as to something as opposed to
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
um a clear-cut lie um about some about
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
some factual matter um the one issue
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
that was raised that um uh I think the
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
committee thought might might uh Merit
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
some further uh action on the part of
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary is uh the suggestion was
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
that it was not that some people
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
involved in family law cases may not be
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
aware of the available remedies of
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
perjury or other types of false
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
statement offenses and that perhaps um
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
in Publications that the judicial branch
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh provides for litigant that that um
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
that more uh a more robust statement of
 
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
the availability of those remedies
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
should be available and that seemed to
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee to be something that
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
was worthwhile um exploring and I think
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch um was not was not
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to doing that attorney krian if
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
you had not just done that would you
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
write that down please for me I think
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
you just probably did our running list
 
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
of what's going in the guide
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
book that there are here are the
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
remedies yeah thank
 
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Lynn on
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
perjury I have one of of you
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
representative would it be your
 
00:22:57.919 --> 00:22:59.909 align:start position:0%
representative would it be your
testimony

00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
that one of the reasons maybe more
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
reasons but at least one of the reasons
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
we have heard from numbers of people
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
when we took testimony last year that
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
there were downright lies going on in
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
that court and nothing was done about it
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
was that the people making those
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
statements a do not know the difference
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
of maybe of a downright lie versus a
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
misapprehension versus something else
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
and B they didn't know the remedy they
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
could have used and that's why some at
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
least people would feel angry that there
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
were lies and nothing happened sure I
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
mean that that certainly could be one of
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
the reasons I think the other thing that
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
really very very important to understand
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
is and I can say this you know
 
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
unquestionably from my own
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
experiences the basic
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
remedy for
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
perjury um in in most not only in family
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
cases but in most in most cases is that
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
the FactFinder if something is perjury
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
the fact find the remedy that the
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
FactFinder May impose is they simply
 
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
don't believe the person um and whether
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know I can I mean just again from
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
personal experience I can remember any
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
number of cases in which I felt that
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
somebody um was uh was probably not
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
telling the truth um and so the remedy
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
that I impos is I was just not going to
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
base a decision on that person's version
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
of the facts and often I would conclude
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
it's just not worth it to refer this you
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
know this person uh to a prosecutor for
 
00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution be for example
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
particularly in a family case um it it
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
it might I might well come to the
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
conclusion look if I refer this there's
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
enough contention going on in this case
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
already um I somebody I think somebody
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
has lied to me I'm not going to base a
 
00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
decision on what I what I believe to be
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh untrue testimony I'm going to make a
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
decision based on what I believe is true
 
00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
testimony but it's not worth it to refer
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
this person for prosecution because
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
that's just going to increase the level
 
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
of tension in the family relationship
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
more than it already is if somebody ends
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
up getting prosecuted now that's not to
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
say that's all always true sometimes
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
some perjury can be significant enough
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
on a matter that's really very important
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
and I would make a referral but often it
 
00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:39.559 align:start position:0%
would be that you would simply decide
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
not to not to make that referral because
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
it would just be more it would be it
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
would be more trouble so to speak than
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
it was worth in the overall scheme of
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
things when you as a judge were faced
 
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
with that and something was offered that
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
you clearly deemed in yourself to be a
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
lie uh and you wouldn't use it in making
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
your decision was there a way that you
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
let the people know that otherwise they
 
00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
might think that lie was allowed to
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
influence you if they don't know to the
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
contrary sure again it depends on this
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
you know so much depends on the
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances but often you know again
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
if it was particularly blatant I might
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
simply say you know this I do I did not
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
believe this person's testimony but
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
often it would be again for the same
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
reason I just pointed out to try to you
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
know keep the the Discord in the family
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
um at as at as at as a reduced level as
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
possible I might simply say something
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
like you know there was there was
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
disputed testimony on this point and I
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
find the I find the facts to be okay in
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
support of the person that you know that
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
I that I thought was telling the truth
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
um without sort of really trying to tag
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
the other person as being a liar any
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
Lynn on his
 
00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
report representative long thank you Mr
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um was there any consideration
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
as to like let's say I I filed against
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
my exp spouse
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
um I told what I thought to be the truth
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
the police and was later determined that
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
that's not the fact however I kept that
 
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
fact up was there any um I mean like if
 
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
a judge says like you would mention
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
right I believe this litigant um but if
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
if the if what you didn't believe is
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
still being brought up is there any
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
further I mean is that
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
allowed when you well when you say if
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's when you say it's it continued to
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
be brought up in other words you mean
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
that like at some later per some later
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
stage in the proceeding right um sure I
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
mean that might you
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
know that might be something that would
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
would in
 
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
would weigh a judge to say maybe I am
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
going to make you know I've I've
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
rejected this once this person you know
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
kind of didn't get the message um and
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
now is tried to you know raise the same
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
thing again sure that might lead you to
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
say okay maybe maybe something stronger
 
00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
does need to be done now to okay you
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
know so yes I think the answer is yes
 
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
thanks Vice chair Smith thank you um if
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
I could ask an another question of my
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
distinguished chair is this possibly an
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
example of a problem that
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
arises when we have more than one judge
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
handling a particular case so that's
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
something where you could clearly see
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh that there was inaccuracy in the
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
testimony that is not necessarily that
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge is not
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily um available to another
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
judge mean that that is absolutely
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
correct you I mean that's that is that
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
is one of the most important reasons I
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
think that it's that it's it's crucial
 
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
and I I completely understand what what
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
attorney krian said and I I agree that
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are sometimes when
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
other considerations prevent you from
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
having from Strictly sticking to the you
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
know one family one judge I understand
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
that but I think you what you point out
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
is really a very uh important reason for
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
having one judge be involved in the case
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
because it's you know when I first went
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
on when I first went on the Superior
 
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
Court we had we had the we had the
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
situation of where there was no well
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
except maybe in homicide cases but other
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
than that there was no assignment uh no
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
practice of one you know one case one
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
judge and so judges moved around a lot
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
and you know this C on on on one month
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
the case would be heard by judge X and A
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
month later something else would come up
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
it would be heard by judge Y and then
 
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
the third month judge Z and it was that
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
kind of situation encouraged litigants
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
who you know to try to you know that I I
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
well I threw this I threw this piece of
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
baloney up against the wall with judge X
 
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
and it didn't work but now there's a new
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
judge and maybe it's worth throwing that
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
same piece of baloney up against the
 
00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
wall because maybe I'll be able to
 
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
convince the new judge that it's true
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
whereas you know if you had if you had
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
more consistency in the judges it would
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
be presumably there would be less
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
incentive to do something like that so
 
00:30:58.269 --> 00:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
you you rais an excellent excellent
 
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
point about one you know why it's so
 
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
important to have one judge assigned to
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
a case whenever possible I would like to
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh I was in the process of texting but
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
he stopped so come on
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
up attorney kigan is it possible given
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
we cannot have a
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
100% one case one judge for reason cited
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
is it possible legally for a judge to
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
make a note in the judge's notes that
 
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
the next judge picking up the case would
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
have to say I thought the testimony of
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
such and such was baloney or some other
 
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:42.519 align:start position:0%
legal term from French
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
law uh so I I think the way that judges
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
typically memorialize things in their
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
case is two ways and that's written
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
orders and and their verbal statements
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
because there isn't really
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
um anything outside of that that should
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
give the person in the complete case um
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
you know we have we have an oral
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
tradition um in the United States that
 
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
very much puts the emphasis on
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
everything coming out in the proceeding
 
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
and if not then in a written order so
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
that you have the complete record what
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
has happened in the case through those
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
available means so there is not a side
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
Ledger that really keeps notes that
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
would be passed but I I think you do see
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
judges note on the record you know you
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
have not been found credible or in
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
orders say you know I've I've I've heard
 
00:32:28.679 --> 00:32:29.470 align:start position:0%
orders say you know I've I've I've heard
this

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
testimony this this testimony was
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
credible this testimony was not so that
 
00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
would typically be where you would find
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
um a judge's appraisal a judge's notes
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
about a case is in their written orders
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
or in their verbal statements in open
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
court representative Lynn do you think
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
that the judge in question here x uh
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
judges X are doing this more than some
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
years ago as a way of mitigating a
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
second judge coming on or is there
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
something that we could encourage to
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
have this information passed along yeah
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
I I I mean I again I think it it sort of
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
depends on the circumstances I think if
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
a Jud you know if a judge really thought
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
something was was kind of blatant
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
baloney um more likely that the judge is
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
going to put in the order put something
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
in his or her order saying you know this
 
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
this argument was made by this litigant
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
and you know it it it has no uh it has
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
no uh credibility or whatever and I'm
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
rejecting it and of course then that
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
would be available for uh for the next
 
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
judge but again is you
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
know sometimes if it's more if it's more
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
subtle uh maybe that doesn't get doesn't
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
get put in um but I I guess I do also
 
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
agree with Miss crean I think it's um
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
the I I I would have difficulty or
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
trouble with the idea of Judges kind of
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
writing little you know notes that are
 
00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:09.079 align:start position:0%
not available sort of side notes that
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
are not available to the public to
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
say you know other words I think our our
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
legal tradition in this country is that
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
judges speak by their orders that that
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
become public records and not by little
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
you know little side notes and so I
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
would I would wan to
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
uh I would not encourage that kind of
 
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
thing representative
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
cab I did want to note that we did find
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
chairman I did want to note that we did
 
00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
find when we were first going through
 
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
this that when the family court was
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
established back in 2005 right from the
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
gecko 490d did specifically state that
 
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
the intent was to have the assignment of
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
all family matters of a single family to
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
one Family Division Justice or marital
 
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
Master located in a family court that's
 
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
geographically accessible to the family
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
so I think that has always been the
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
intent of the general court here that we
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
we wanted that to
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
of kind
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
of really pressing that that really
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
needs to happen because it I think it is
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
important that we've heard from families
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
that have now gone through five
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
different judges I understand that a
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
judge may move away or retire and there
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
may be a circumstance but I think it's a
 
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
whole separate thing when on a regular
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
basis it's happening that we're just
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
flip-flopping between judges is there a
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
families I think that's a great question
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges we've had is just
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
this overturn of a very large generation
 
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
that we have in public service generally
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
but certainly in the court as judges um
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
that some of the those judges are
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
willing to stay on um and and keep some
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
of their complex and long running cases
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
as judicial referees and and continue
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
working them but sometimes not and we're
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
bringing up a a large a relatively large
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
number of newer judges and there is some
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
shuffling to the places where there are
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
gaps and then there is some people who
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
are assigned to be in multiple locations
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that the court is
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
open on those days and there's a judge
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
available I know that it was certainly
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
it was something I discussed with um
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
judge king a lot before uh the end of
 
00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
his term that he really wanted to get
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
to a place of more stasis once we had
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
more of a settlement with the the new
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
judges of this is your court it's your
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
court for a very long time um you know
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
if if this person is mid-career as many
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
of these judges are they could be a
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
judge for 30 years um and they could see
 
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
a family all the way through to the Next
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
Generation uh so I know that that was
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
certainly his hope uh three more judges
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
have just been nominated bringing the
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court to 49 when if they are
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
confirmed uh that that would be the way
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
to achieve more stasis is not having
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
this sort of generational overturn that
 
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
we've had in the judges um and bringing
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
on so many people who will have
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully long careers um in the
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
Judiciary uh it is it is always a little
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
challenge for different reasons but that
 
00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:11.720 align:start position:0%
was something that he thought was a
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
particularly bad epic for us because of
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
that turnover and that the hope is that
 
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
it will not be people's experience to
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
the same extent that it has been that
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
they see changes in
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
judges thank you and we are on the
 
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on perjury let's uh try not
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
to revisit some things we have have
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
already discussed and conveyed uh
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
anything else on the report on perjury
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%

questions uh would somebody move the

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
of Finance late of Health and Human
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
Services committee was keenly interested
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
in and uh suggested this be something
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
important to our work with family court
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative katab would you make your
 
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.750 align:start position:0%
representative katab would you make your
report

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
please unfortunately representative
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh wasn't able to come to either
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
of the meetings so we didn't get to hear
 
00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:43.910 align:start position:0%
of the meetings so we didn't get to hear
kind

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
kind
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
of from him on this however we did we
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
did look into this
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
and representative Smith was able to get
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
a nice audit report which is included on
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
the back showing
 
00:39:59.230 --> 00:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
really the information that we were
 
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
looking for which was how how why and
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
where all of
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
the title four relative to the Social
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
Security Act funding goes in New
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it was pretty minimal in
 
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
the area of Family
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
Court Family Court really only gets
 
00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
involved with title title four to
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
establish uniform support order when
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
establishing paternity when necessary if
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
a party is refusing testing the
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
modification of the support
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
orders every 3 years or earlier if
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's significant change in
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances and then show cause
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
hearings and then in Superior Court
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's a criminal uh nonsupport cases
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
through the Superior Court which are
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
very rare and there's less than 10 of
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
those a
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
year through this we did discover that
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
there's an
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
automatic assignment of income wage
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
garnishment even if the parties had
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
always been a paying on time unless the
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
parties had agreed otherwise or if there
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
was good cause not to require it and
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
there was concern that wage garnishment
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
could affect somebody's employment it is
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
something that you do have to fill out
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
on a background check and whatnot and
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
there might be some bias that if
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
somebody's having wage garnishment
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
people may presume wrongfully so that
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
the person is a deadbeat so to speak
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
because they're not they must not be
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
paying which is just completely untrue
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
because this is just happening the
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
majority of the
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
time upon further looking into it this
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
was actually required by federal law La
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
that this be the presumption and if we
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
aren't compliant with it then we
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be eligible for not only title
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
defunding but also title A and E funding
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
as well which approximates to about
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
19 uh million do a year and it just
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be something that we likely as
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
a state could afford to to forego and be
 
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:47.079 align:start position:0%
like we're not going to follow this this
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
Federal requirement so while we do note
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
that it's an issue upon further looking
 
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
it seems as that at this point all 50
 
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
states and four territories are all
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
except ing of this and so I think it
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
really if it's something that needs to
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
change needs to change more at a federal
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
level um and so that was where we kind
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
of landed on this title four stuff and
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
again all the
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
detailed findings in here are in the
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
back your operative uh charge to us or
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation is the last paragraph of
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
the first page uh I would assume that
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
you do not recommend any change at this
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
time and you did not discover any issues
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
relative to title
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
4 so at this time we didn't recommend
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
any state leg legislative changes
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
because again this was a federal thing
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
we also noted that hb564 relative to the
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines had just passed
 
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't go into effect until
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
January 1st and so we feel that it's
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
important that we see how the impl
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
implementation of that implementation of
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
that legislation goes before considering
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
a further change to that I think it's
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
really important that
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
we we need to see how that's going
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
before we we get into further changes
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
that hasn't even been enacted yet so
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
um any questions of Representative katab
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcbath and sorry for not
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
recognizing you earlier to to come on in
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
and sit down it's been a rough week and
 
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
my mind is flitting about okay well
 
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for recognizing me now thank
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
you um representa to my question is um
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
these is there anything we can do to
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
prevent I don't know who is what
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
employers are requiring the background
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
checks but uh I mean requiring the
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
information that garnishment be on a
 
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
background check but if it's the state
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
we certainly could change it so that
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
that question isn't asked um I mean if
 
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
we're you know if it if we know that
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's a federal law and it's a
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
requirement State too I mean that that
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
child support is garnished then why
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
don't we address that issue and not
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
allow that to be a um a request for
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
information when people are employed
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
being employed um May I yes thank
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
youman so essentially a lot of it was
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
coming up on federal background checks
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
like if you were get getting a security
 
00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
clearance so obviously we couldn't get
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
into that it does usually it does state
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
are you having wage garnishment for any
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
reason and then it allows you to explain
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
so the person can explain it I suppose
 
00:44:32.829 --> 00:44:32.839 align:start position:0%
on I could look at the state background
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
check form and see I think it would
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
still be a question where the reason
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
that I because I did spend some some
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
time looking into why the question is
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
asked and the reason why the question
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
was asked was if you are having wage
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
garnishment because you weren't paying
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
something then it's thought of that you
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
may be more of a liability more likely
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
to be able to be bribed so to speak in
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
in any and and that's relevant to
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
several type of type of jobs where you
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that this person isn't
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
isn't hurting for money so to speak and
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
might be more likely that they may be
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
more bribable so to speak and so that's
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
why the question ends up being asked so
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
I guess maybe on state forms it could be
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
asked if it was for non-payment the
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
question could be changed to say are you
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
having W wage garnishment because of
 
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.150 align:start position:0%
having W wage garnishment because of
non-payment

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
non-payment
 
00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.990 align:start position:0%
non-payment
maybe

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so I appreciate that
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
I I that that's an area I think that we
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
might want to pursue further um even
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
having um a statute that says you know
 
00:45:36.549 --> 00:45:36.559 align:start position:0%
this is our policy and it cannot be used
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
against um you know uh people that are
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
applying for jobs um even on a form
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
because it seems like there's a
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
significant amount of people that are
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
going to have to say yes I'm my child
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
support's garnished and a very small
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
amount of people that actually the
 
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
question would be relevant for so um I
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate your work on this it's very
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
significant and I um but I recognize the
 
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
issue and I think the state could do
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
what it can to not ask the question if
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
it's not relevant or to ask the relevant
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
questions um and also to maybe be clear
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
this is the state's policy you know
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to be garnishing wages just
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
because it's easier whatever thank you
 
00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.750 align:start position:0%
because it's easier whatever thank you
representative

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
ball thank you excuse me thank you
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson and I truly do
 
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh representative MC Beth
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
what you bring forward um I do have some
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
concerns though in going in that
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
direction because this in particular
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
happens um is a concern when we're
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
hiring police officers and if they are
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
have a questionable Integrity um because
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
they're really not paying their um child
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
support then it could mean that as we
 
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
said they could be easily bribed they
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
could lose evidence there's so many
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
things that could um hurt people in
 
00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
other ways I I'm looking at this and
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
wondering why can't we use the caveat
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's given to us by the federal
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
government that says if the judge
 
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
determines that there is no reason for
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
it then there doesn't need to they don't
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
need to have it it's written in the
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
federal law we have a caveat that if we
 
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
were just to
 
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
say whether it was the marital um
 
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
magistrate I forget what you call them
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
um or the judge make sure or an attorney
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that the people are aware of
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
the possible ramifications of signing up
 
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
for this versus if you're paying on time
 
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
you've never had a problem you could
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
continue in that manner um because that
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
is allowable under the way the the way
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
law so I can Beth yes go ahead respond
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
but these are initial orders so there is
 
00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
not experience of whether the person has
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
paid or not and just for me my
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
preference would be that it was taken
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
out that I never I mean so
 
00:47:58.589 --> 00:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
again I understand what you're saying
 
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's just a different philosophy but I I
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
think further looking at it would be a
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
good idea and maybe for police officers
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
if that's such a signif or for certain
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
report I mean for certain um employers
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
but again I just bringing up I I I don't
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know thank
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
you representative ball thank you it
 
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
does go beyond police officers it goes
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
into um top secret clearance for
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
military and
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
um institutions and things for anybody
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:33.079 align:start position:0%
what is the will of the committee do we
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
accept the report as written with the
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
statements we've made noted in the
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
clerk's report that at some point uh
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
somebody may wish to file legislation on
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
this or is it the committee's desire to
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
add a sentence or two to the report as
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.270 align:start position:0%
 
us

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
may represent
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman uh yeah I I
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
accept uh I was at the meeting and I I
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
was fully satisfied with uh with this
 
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:09.640 align:start position:0%
report and how to address um somebody
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
can bring in further legislation to
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
address the jobs where gunishment may
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
hurt you I know uh Clarence at seor
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear plan that was also question that
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
I was asked that question when I worked
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
here any anyone
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
else representative katab thank you
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
chairman peon I guess I would be a
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
little hesitant to put that into the
 
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
report right now unless we can actually
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
research and find out that that is on
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
the state background check because I
 
00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:41.559 align:start position:0%
haven't check explored that I do know
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
that it was on the security clearance
 
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
check that was a federal but I'm not
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
sure from a state level I'd be certainly
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
open to that sort of legislation but I'd
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
recommending something that is relevant
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
I did try and just do a quick search and
 
00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
I wasn't able to find it that quickly
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh that would be my only hesitation
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
is that I want to make sure whatever
 
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
we're putting in here
 
00:50:02.829 --> 00:50:02.839 align:start position:0%
we've vetted but I would absolutely be
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
supportive of a bill if we were a if we
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
did find out that that was happening I'd
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
definitely support
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
that so accepting this report is not
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
with prejudice against anyone else
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
taking this and running with it should
 
00:50:17.069 --> 00:50:17.079 align:start position:0%
he or she
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
choose okay uh our chair will entertain
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%

um here's some things that
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
happened because of our first year of
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
work uh some of the discussions led to
 
00:51:46.789 --> 00:51:46.799 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary actions some of our
 
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
discussions led to lsrs fil turned into
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
bills and passed and signed so just take
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
a read over this and think is this
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
something we might wish to put at the
 
00:51:57.359 --> 00:52:54.910 align:start position:0%
something we might wish to put at the
end

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
katab had a good idea of also entering
 
00:53:50.109 --> 00:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
these three bills that uh we could we
 
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
could fit so I would move that these be
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
added to the uh report thank you you
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
know while while many reports oh that
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
was a motion sorry uh you are moving
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%

CR now we can have discussion and um as
 
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
we know there have been uh
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
various groups
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
in various levels of
 
00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.230 align:start position:0%
in various levels of
[Music]

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
formality addressing family
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
court and some of them having read all
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
the reports including a few little ad
 
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
hoc Gatherings let's just say I think
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful going forward
 
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
to the next time this sort of special
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee is convened to say darn you
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
know when you cooperate and get good
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
things done and I think that's what this
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
document um and thank you for this uh
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
has done any other comments on new laws
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
passed document yes representative
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
McBeth so thank you um so I
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
I think it's well written as far as the
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
description of the bills I'm I'm a
 
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more humble I think or modest
 
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we should say laws
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
passed because of the testimony and it's
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
just semantics I mean I recognize the
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
the Decades of people behind us and
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
other members that have worked on these
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
issues and pushed them it's like the the
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
toothpaste might have come out when we
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
squeezed it but or when we got testimony
 
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of people that have
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
worked in the past so i' kind of like to
 
00:55:44.029 --> 00:55:44.039 align:start position:0%
change maybe the
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
title of the of the make a suggestion
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
because I've got one if you don't all
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
well let's let's hear yours and then
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
I'll discuss it thank you new laws
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
passed in
 
00:55:57.549 --> 00:55:57.559 align:start position:0%
part because of the test
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
imy of this in part takes some credit
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
where credit is due but doesn't take all
 
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
the credit other
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%

Churchill's comment about Clement Atley
 
00:56:43.349 --> 00:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
when Churchill who was not known for
 
00:56:45.549 --> 00:56:45.559 align:start position:0%
modesty was told you should be like
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
Clement Atley he's a modest man
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
Churchill he has much to be modest
 
00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%

interim report of um this
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee as of November 20th of last
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
year and we voted on this so this was a
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
done deal in fact it was a done deal
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
reading the report of and when we
 
00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:45.039 align:start position:0%
decided we're having so much fun let's
 
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
keep going and I can pretty much in part
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
convinced you of that uh that led to the
 
00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
work we just did so what you have before
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
us is a done deal doesn't mean we can't
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
change it just don't please nitpick it
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh we we had that time and I suggest
 
00:58:05.839 --> 00:58:06.990 align:start position:0%
uh we we had that time and I suggest
that

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
supplementing that
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
are the three subcommittee reports we
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
just unanimously voted and the final
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
self- congratulatory thing which as
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
amended we just voted and we put them
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
all together and that would be our final
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
report now there were were additional
 
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.150 align:start position:0%
report now there were were additional
documents

00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
supplied as I recall that I don't see
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
attached do I see them attached I don't
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
see them attached but they were voted on
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
right they weren't voted on so the only
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
way uh today this morning we can vote
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
those supplemental documents is either
 
00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
by us seeing them and voting on them or
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
by someone suggesting can we have the
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
report on and we take that as sufficient
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
and choose to vote Yes representative
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
katab thank you chairman P so when we
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
did this initial report we had discussed
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
that this was just kind of a draft in
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
there and that we weren't going to worry
 
00:59:09.039 --> 00:59:10.069 align:start position:0%
there and that we weren't going to worry
about

00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
putting uh a lot of the attachments in
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
here which was relative to the research
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
that was done by the committee
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
researcher on several of the topics I do
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
summarize the majority of issues that
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
were brought up and then put in the
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
research that was done on those issues
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
so that we're not Reinventing the wheel
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
should somebody pick this up in the
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
future and I do feel like it's it's
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
especially important where we did pick
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
certain areas that we were going to do
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee topics on but there were
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
some that we didn't that that were in
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
fact issues just to document them
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere I do feel like we need to have
 
00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
some sort of an
 
00:59:47.079 --> 00:59:48.589 align:start position:0%
some sort of an
overall

00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
um piece in here that summarizes you
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
know hey several parents complained or
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
were concerned about the one family one
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
judge issue there was also the domestic
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
violence issue so there I think there
 
01:00:02.109 --> 01:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
were several pieces that are important
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
that we list
 
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
out I would suggest that the committee
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
refer back to some emails I sent out two
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
three and four weeks ago to the effect
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
that if you have some stuff send it to
 
01:00:17.069 --> 01:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
me and I didn't get a lot of stuff so if
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
there's reports that somebody wishes to
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
be included in this final report I don't
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
see them in front of
 
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
us chair can um I think Vice chair um I
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn was first okay you
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
want to throw fingers or paper scissors
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
no can I just make a I just I just throw
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
this out as a suggestion could we
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
say that we are could we basically have
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
a motion that would say we are going to
 
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
adopt the interim
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
Report with the three subcommittee
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
reports and the um the uh backpacking
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
backpacking report
 
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh page that summarizes legislation that
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
was passed in part because of this as
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
our final report and we are going to
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
include as attachments to the final
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
report all the materials that were
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
presented to the subcommittee um that
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
were presented to the committee um
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
you know I will consider those that
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
those will be considered as attachments
 
01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
and we
 
01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
be attached to the final report I assume
 
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
since I was I was not in right the I was
 
01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:39.559 align:start position:0%
not a member of the committee when those
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh earlier uh submissions were made but
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
I assume if we've if they were submitted
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
and they were you know and they're
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
they're sort of in the record there's no
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
reason we couldn't just attach them to
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
the final
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
report any further discuss question on
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's Point
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
representative Vice chair Smith Smith
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
I I agree in principle with what
 
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.190 align:start position:0%
I I agree in principle with what
representative

01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
Lynn has just propose but I think we
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
have to be more specific about what we
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
mean when we refer to materials
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
submitted we had um file draws for
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
of materials submitted and that I think
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
is not the the
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
definition that would work best I think
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
we could talk about the research that
 
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
was done by our
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
staff as a more um
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
focused uh identification of uh the
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
materials that we used and I said say
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
that because in in good faith and
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
certainly out of concern we had many uh
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
Witnesses come and present to
 
01:03:06.559 --> 01:03:09.150 align:start position:0%
Witnesses come and present to
us

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.069 align:start position:0%
us
um

01:03:11.069 --> 01:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:12.870 align:start position:0%
um
enormous

01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
enormous
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
quantities of
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
um the cases that they have had before
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
the family court and I think that
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
material belongs to the family court not
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
legislative branch which is why I worry
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
about that but I also am concerned about
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
um the conclusory sections for example I
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
do see in here reference to the need for
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
um Education and Training I do see some
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
reference to the import importance of
 
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
the statutory language of intent of one
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
family one
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
Court um but uh there are there are
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
other other uh basic arguments that we
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
have made
 
01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
um that are not in here one that to me
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
is I think one of the most important
 
01:04:30.269 --> 01:04:30.279 align:start position:0%
is rather than a need for new
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
judges given um a limited amount of
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
Financial Resources I believe that the
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
judges in this court
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
need what in other courts could be
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
called clerks or could be called um
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
assistance you I I don't I'm not going
 
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
to dictate what the title is but judges
 
01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.950 align:start position:0%
to dictate what the title is but judges
need

01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
support and they need support in
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping they need support in
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
producing um uh their
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
findings they need support so that uh
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
claimants do not have to wait for weeks
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
or sometimes months to get a decision
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
not because the judge is being um
 
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
irresponsible but because there are so
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
many hours in the day Madam Vice chair
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stop you there because uh
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
we have discussed this and this has been
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
conveyed to the courts they agree with
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
us this is aspirational and they are
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
trying to get it out of the next budget
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
in a year where they may not get much
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
but I think everybody agrees with this
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
well if everybody agrees Mr chair then
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
it ought to be listed in the report in a
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
way that reinforces how important that
 
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
is it is we are not negotiating here
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
with the courts I appreciate the help
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
that Council kigan has given to us but
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
this is a legislative committee where
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
would you put this in the report I would
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
put it first not point point to it to
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
us Mr chair I'm not going to second
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
guess you and I'm not going to sit here
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the clock and rewrite this
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
report I think we need a final version
 
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
of a report before this committee votes
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
on it and I think an interim report is
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
important but it is that an interm
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
report not a final report may I suggest
 
01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
that this and I just want to add one
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
other thing I have offered to you on at
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
least three occasions that I would help
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
write that report okay and you did not
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
want that you you know you wanted to
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
proceed un not helpful not helpful may I
 
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
suggest that this committee recesses and
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to go into this final
 
01:07:09.269 --> 01:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
report whether it's a word tweak or a
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph somewhere you come back with
 
01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.990 align:start position:0%
paragraph somewhere you come back with
those

01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
words and a specific place where you
 
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
want it to go and we will
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
reconvene maybe in about 45 minutes this
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
should give you oh that's not then will
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
not happen then this will not happen
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
because we cannot schedule another
 
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
meeting we have today well actually we
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
could it's only Tuesday we could put it
 
01:07:42.269 --> 01:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
in the calendar for when for next
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
week when is this report to November
 
01:07:47.549 --> 01:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
around November 1 I don't choose to do
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
that that's that's your choice and I
 
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
respect your right to make that choice
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
unless others do if some would like to
 
01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
we can end this meeting and you can
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
suggest any changes you want and we will
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
put it in the calendar for next
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
Tuesday can I can I suggest you a
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
motion so I would I move that we adopt I
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
I make the following motion that we
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
adopt the interim
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
Report with the three three new
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee reports plus the um uh memo
 
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
outlining the new legislation that has
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
been passed in part because of this uh
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
because of this committee's work okay uh
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
and that uh that the the uh interim
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
report be supplemented in addition to by
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
those those four things by the um
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
research that has been
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh provided by the uh office of
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
legislative services to to the
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
committee and that the final report also
 
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
indicate that the committee believes
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
that um additional
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
resources uh in in terms of law clerks
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
or other kinds of uh judicial assistance
 
01:09:25.199 --> 01:09:26.110 align:start position:0%
or other kinds of uh judicial assistance
uh

01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:26.950 align:start position:0%
uh
would

01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
be uh strongly in uh recommended as
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature consider
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
that uh that be adopted as our final you
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
would give that
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
as an addendum that last point that we
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
will trust our beloved Vice chair to
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
write out she gets to fill out the blank
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
that we have voting in are you happy
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm fine I mean I would be fine
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
with I will do anything that um that the
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh chooses to do as long and
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
and do my part as I always have tried to
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
do as long as it in fact reflects what
 
01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.070 align:start position:0%
do as long as it in fact reflects what
the

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
committee agrees are the key findings
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
from the work that we have done over the
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
last two years
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to hold your Motion in OB
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
bance for a minute representative Lynn I
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
would add to it that in the interim
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
report wherever the word interim occurs

reports Plus
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
the memo of the new legislation passed
 
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
and be supplemented by research provided
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%

resources of law clerks and addition
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
additional that's where I lost it I
 
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if you just ended
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
it I'm sorry that that um additional
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
that the that the final report recommend
 
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
that the legislature consider additional
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh J for the Family Division of the
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court to
 
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
include uh law clerks or other uh
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
judicial assistants so you would make
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
that you are making that language in
 
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
this motion that she suggested right and
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
I and you know I mean I I make that
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
motion just be in the interest of sort
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
of hoping to get everybody together so
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
we could have a vote on this but I
 
01:12:59.790 --> 01:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
I would completely defer if the if the
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
option were to to have representative
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
Smith uh draft some language which would
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
be much more articulate than what I've
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
just stated I'm sure um I would
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
certainly defer to that but in the
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
interest of you know if if what I've
 
01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
sort of proposed is kind of good enough
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
so to speak um then the advantage of
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
doing what I've proposed is we could
 
01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
just vote on it but I have no doubt that
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative Smith could do a better
 
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
job that forgot but all right any
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion on what is not quite
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
yet the first is the first alternative
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
but not yet a motion representative long
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um yeah I'm good
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
with the language that representative ly
 
01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
says uh again to be up to uh Vice chair
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
whether she wanted to add language I
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
think it's important to add that we did
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
visit the circuit court and that we were
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
unanimous in the fact that uh um judges
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
needed help um however that may be
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's a clerk or
 
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
whatever I fine I have no Pro I'm happy
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
to add the language you just suggested
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative law um all right why
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
this your
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
motion we
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
recess you write out that phrase so it
 
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
is your language we come back and vote
 
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
on the whole thing are you comfortable
 
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
with that or you now right now uh yeah
 
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
we I will start my next committee it
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
will be brief I I I thank you very much
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
but this is very important work I
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
believe and so that's no I'm not I'm not
 
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
going to do this in 20 minutes and I do
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
want to make the record clear um Mr
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
chair that I did right to you um perhaps
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
other people didn't make suggestions but
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
I did write and mentioned in their three
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
points that I thought were very
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
important and to be included in the
 
01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
report so I did do do my part duly noted
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
at least once representative
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
mcbf thank you for recognizing me um so
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going just a little bit different
 
01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm uncomfortable with um doing
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
thing I know I think we're all a little
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
bit uncomfortable but I do think there's
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
some points that are maybe we could add
 
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
in on page 10 of the report you ask for
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
specific there aren't numbers but it's
 
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee judicial training
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
education and supervision and
 
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
accountability um the second page of
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
that the top paragraph starts out
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
however charged with addressing the
 
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
obvious problems within the existing
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
structure there are certain threshold
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
issues right there I would suggest if
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
adding reaffirming the state
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
legislature's previous statutory
 
01:15:51.750 --> 01:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
directives of one Court one one case one
 
01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:55.960 align:start position:0%
judge so you had ask I may not have read
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
every email from every person but
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
believe me I did ask many times for
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
these things to be looked at well ahead
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
of today so I'm going to say this
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
report's good enough I'm going to say
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
we've been on the record there's
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
testimony there's video the court is
 
01:16:14.629 --> 01:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
bending over backwards to try to go
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
along with what we're doing so we could
 
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
spend a long time redoing what we've
 
01:16:23.629 --> 01:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
already voted on and I'm not I am not of
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
a mind to do that so
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
and may I follow up so I do respect that
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
I would just the only so that would be
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
one sentence there and then on that same
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
page the third paragraph where it talks
 
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
about judicial duties for judges to do
 
01:16:39.149 --> 01:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
the judicial Duty they must have
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
staffing issues right there at the very
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
end of that I would suggest the uh
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
statement that um Justice Lynn had just
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
provided additional resources um are
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
strongly encouraged to be considered for
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
this purpose in future by Future legis
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
all right those I'm going to put an
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
alternative before you because I'm going
 
01:16:59.709 --> 01:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
to bring this to a close and you may not
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
be happy so let me give you a choice
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
choice number one is what representative
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
Lynn has articulated that becomes the
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
motion we vote on the motion or we do
 
01:17:16.629 --> 01:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
not vote on this but we have a meeting
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
in Thursday's calendar noticed for next
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
Tuesday at 9:30 to bring in what you
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
have submitted ahead of time those are
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
your two
 
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
choices uh can I going to take a stra
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take a straw poll of choice
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
one choice two Choice one
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
is it's the deadline of what that's for
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
interim study reports that's not for
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
this I did ask thank you but thank you
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
for for trying to do that choice
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
one we go to representative Lynn's
 
01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
motion Choice two is we come back next
 
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:57.320 align:start position:0%

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
poll not counting except for what we do
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
next choice one we accept representative
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
hands Choice two we come back next week
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%

um could um I I it seems to me that left
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
un said is that I have a big
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility here between now and next
 
01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and so I'm one wondering if my
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues would be kind enough to send
 
01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.390 align:start position:0%
colleagues would be kind enough to send
to

01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
me suggestions that they have to be
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
included in a final report and I will
 
01:19:13.229 --> 01:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
try to collect all of those and submit
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
them to uh the committee in advance of
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday for your
 
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
careful editing you'd like to collate
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
everything that comes in that is correct
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
so we get one document we and we'll have
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
one document and I'm hoping that that
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
would make it easier for everyone else
 
01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
and I have to buy a car so yes it will
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%

01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%

01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%

01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't see any negatives so let's
 
01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
do that and uh we will schedule our
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%

01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
