within your committee report you'll note
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
that there's some statistics on suicide
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
in our country i'm not going to go into
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
that you can read that just as well as i
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
can say it
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
but one thing we are the second leading
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
the second leading cause of death
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
amongst those that are ages 10 through
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
34 in our country
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
is suicide
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
will address the issue of suicide
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
issues amongst our young people here in
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's not a complete
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
and thorough way to
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
answer this problem but it's one solid
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
step forward
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
for those schools which issue id cards
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
for students be it a
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
elementary school through a secondary
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
school or post-secondary institution in
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
our state when the id card is issued
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
on the back side the national suicide
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
prevention lifeline will be printed
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
there on the back of that card
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
with the new number there's a 1 800
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
number but the new number
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
988 which will go in effect july 16
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
for folks to call in case of
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
a need and there are needs in this state
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
why this
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
what does the suicide prevention hotline
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
or lifeline provide it provides
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
prevention of resources it provides
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
mental health services and it provides a
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
live voice for one to talk with
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
in such a awful situation in a possible
 
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.789 align:start position:0%
in such a awful situation in a possible
tragedy

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
tragedy
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
during the committee hearing
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
i was very pressed in fact overwhelmed
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
with the deep and sincere
 
00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:21.909 align:start position:0%
with the deep and sincere
presentation

00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
by jason's parents
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
to quote
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
his mother
 
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.310 align:start position:0%
his mother
martha

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
martha
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
my hope is of
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
is if one student in new hampshire has
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
the number
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
and sees it one day that number in the
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
backside that card
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
and makes that call
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
and saves themselves
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's a success
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's truly a success
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
will this act make a difference my
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
answer is yes it will
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
this bill provides hope
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
when you open that door from
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.190 align:start position:0%
when you open that door from
hopelessness

00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
hopelessness
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
and meet hope
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
and you meet the light of day
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to have available to
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
those that are looking at this awful end
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
during the committee hearing process
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
we heard that jason
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
was very politically oriented
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
and perhaps with the passage of this
 
00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.710 align:start position:0%
and perhaps with the passage of this
bill

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
another young person with another
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
similar dream
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
may fully
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
have that dream
 
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.310 align:start position:0%
have that dream
come

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
and perhaps even sit in this chamber
 
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.470 align:start position:0%
and perhaps even sit in this chamber
someday

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
someday
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
instead of taking that tragic route of
 
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.149 align:start position:0%
instead of taking that tragic route of
suicide

00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%

and
if

00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
i also know that the
 
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.030 align:start position:0%
i also know that the
the

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee wanted to
 
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.710 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee wanted to
accommodate

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
the insurance department
 
00:40:35.119 --> 00:40:36.630 align:start position:0%
the insurance department
and

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
grant them a request for the information
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
they requested which was the nature and
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
the timing of telephone calls
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
and limited to that only
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
if i know this was put on the calendar
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
as ought to pass with the idea that we
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
would have a floor amendment
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
specifying or limiting their ability to
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
have access to that information
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that when the
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
insurance department found out the
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
access was limited
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
they were very unhappy
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
they wanted unfettered access
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
including the ability to have access to
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
listen to and receive copies of
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
telephone calls
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
without going through law enforcement or
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
getting a warrant
 
00:41:23.359 --> 00:41:24.390 align:start position:0%
getting a warrant
and

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.430 align:start position:0%
and
so

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.470 align:start position:0%
so
therefore

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh i believe that the committee feels
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
it this this is a parliamentary
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative yes
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
and and finally
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%

the

committee amendment that we just passed
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
deals with youth night work these are 16
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
and 17 year old kids
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
and what that amendment did was it
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
repealed any limitation on night work
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
i'm a parent many of you are parents
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
some of you will be parents
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
um and i think we all care about kids
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
and frankly
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
having no limitation on night work for
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 year olds
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
is just
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
i can imagine
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
an employer
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
coming to a 16 year old and saying look
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
we've got a major restocking we've got
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
to do tonight
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask you to stay late
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
really late
 
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.309 align:start position:0%
really late
and

00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
complete the restocking and if you can't
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
make it to school tomorrow it's just one
 
00:48:16.319 --> 00:48:17.750 align:start position:0%
make it to school tomorrow it's just one
day

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
and they can do that as often as they
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
need to or want to
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
without limitation
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
i think that's a big step too far
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
replaces

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
replaces
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
the current very confusing limitation on
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
night work for 16 and 17 year olds
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
or currently a lot of employers because
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's so confusing they limit their
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh 16 to 17 year olds to working in
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
until only eight o'clock
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
because there's a very convoluted i'm
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
not going to try to explain it because
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
it ain't worth it um one way or the
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
other we're gonna replace this
 
00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:56.950 align:start position:0%
other we're gonna replace this
um

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
i propose that we do put a reasonable
 
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
my amendment
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
proposes the following language
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
night work
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
no youth which is a 16 or 17 year old by
 
00:49:13.359 --> 00:49:14.950 align:start position:0%
no youth which is a 16 or 17 year old by
definition

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
shall be permitted to work later than 9
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
p.m on any day when the day following is
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
a school day
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
or later than 12 a.m
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
on any other day
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
during the summer they can work until
 
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.549 align:start position:0%
during the summer they can work until
midnight

00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
midnight
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
if the following day is a holiday they
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
can work until midnight
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
if it's a school vacation week they can
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
work until midnight
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
christmas vacation week
 
00:49:44.319 --> 00:49:45.910 align:start position:0%
christmas vacation week
midnight

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
midnight
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
if there's school tomorrow
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
they have to be done working by nine
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
nine pm
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
i think it's reasonable
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
as a parent
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
want that type of limitation for a 16 or
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
17 year old and i ask you to support
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i ask for a division vote
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
i rise in opposition to this floor
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
amendment on sb 345.
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i noticed that some of my
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues here
 
00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
know what the s stands for for i
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
can't seem to keep track of that myself
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
what i do know mr speaker
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
is that we tend to get this rush of
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
these sb bills
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
right at the end of session
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
and and they're put together in a
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
different way than we would put together
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
bills here in the house
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of times these sb bills have a
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
number of provisions in them that could
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
easily be
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
separate laws but they tend to get
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
lumped together into a single bill
 
00:51:07.359 --> 00:51:08.549 align:start position:0%
lumped together into a single bill
um

00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
part of doing this seems to be that they
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
come together in this lump
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
to build a consensus
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
and sometimes sometimes
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
it seems like there are last
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
provisions shoved into a bill to build
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
that consensus
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i think all of these
 
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.589 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i think all of these
replies

00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
replies
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
this is on the amendment this is on the
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
amendment yes
 
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.710 align:start position:0%
amendment yes
because

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
changes multiple pieces
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
of this senate bill
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i want to point out that there are
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
this this i just remind the member again
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
this is on the amendment alone yes of
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
course not not on the senate bill itself
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:17.589 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:20.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
the issue with this bill as it came to
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
us and why it needed to be amended
 
00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:26.549 align:start position:0%
us and why it needed to be amended
is

00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:26.559 --> 00:52:29.109 align:start position:0%
is
that

00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
this is a bill is being amended correct
 
00:52:33.599 --> 00:52:38.230 align:start position:0%
this is a bill is being amended correct
yes

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment has
 
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.870 align:start position:0%
this amendment has
serious

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
technical problems we we heard a little
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
bit about the the debate on
 
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.230 align:start position:0%
bit about the the debate on
policy

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
but beyond that debate on policy
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
the language that's before us is
 
00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.950 align:start position:0%
the language that's before us is
unworkable

00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
unworkable
 
00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.710 align:start position:0%
unworkable
um

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
i'll go through just one of the issues
 
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.270 align:start position:0%
i'll go through just one of the issues
and

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
the the amendments in the calendar you
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
can you can take a look at this if you
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
want i'll try to explain it
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
so let's just go to section two in the
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
floor amendment
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
and what this deals with is a different
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
provision than what the previous speaker
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
this is a section of current law
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
that sets up the limit
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
to the number of hours that a teen can
 
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.470 align:start position:0%
to the number of hours that a teen can
work

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
during a week
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
which sounds simple enough
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
we can understand that the problem is
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's in this multi-tiered set of
 
00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.030 align:start position:0%
it's in this multi-tiered set of
restrictions

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
so if you're 15 years old
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
and school is in session there's one
 
00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.309 align:start position:0%
and school is in session there's one
limit

00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
if you're 15 years old and school is not
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
in session it's the summer there's
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
another limit
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
and this is in section two of the
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that i'm referring to
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
if you're 16 and 17 years old and school
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
is in session for five days
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
there's a limit for that
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
if it's four days there's a limit for
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
that if there's three two or one we'll
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
lump that together there's a limit for
 
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.750 align:start position:0%
lump that together there's a limit for
that

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
if it's zero days there's a separate
 
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.710 align:start position:0%
if it's zero days there's a separate
limit

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
and if it
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
is a 16 or 17 year old who is no longer
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
duly enrolled in school so they've
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
graduated there's another limit for that
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
if you look at the amendment
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
it does a good thing that we all agree
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
to it crosses out some of that
 
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.109 align:start position:0%
to it crosses out some of that
complication

00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
complication
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
but it goes a little too far if you look
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
at all the things that are crossed out
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that it crosses out is
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
when this provision is applicable
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
leaving what's left in the amended
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
language to apply generally
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
what it does is
 
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.270 align:start position:0%
what it does is
for

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
a 17 year old during the summer
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
if we adopt the language in this meant
 
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.390 align:start position:0%
if we adopt the language in this meant
amendment

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
is now restricted to working fewer hours
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
than a 15 year old can work during the
 
00:55:17.839 --> 00:55:19.589 align:start position:0%
than a 15 year old can work during the
summer

00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
summer
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
i don't believe listening to the
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
explanation that this was the intent of
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's purely a technical issue
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
with how the language was put together
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a serious problem if we
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
adopt this
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
i can go on mr speaker i know
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
i know nobody wants me to so i'll stop
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
with that and just say
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
we cannot adopt this amendment due to
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
errors in the language i ask that you
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
reject this amendment and we move to an
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
up or down vote on the underlying bill
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker does the member
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i thank the member
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh with reference that you made to
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
having a
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
large spate of senate bills to deal with
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh i noticed that your committee only
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
got four senate bills and i'm wondering
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
why is it that your committee didn't
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
have time
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
to perfect the language and clarify it
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
for just the instances that you were
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
addressing why didn't you have that time
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and the question
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
seems to be on other actions we took on
 
00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
this bill in committee which i was asked
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
not to speak about so i i don't think i
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
can answer that
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
does a member yield to further questions
 
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.950 align:start position:0%
does a member yield to further questions
yes

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank you mr
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
seaworth my good friend from labor
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
with whom we've served several terms
 
00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.910 align:start position:0%
with whom we've served several terms
together

00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
bill that we're trying to correct
 
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
and and i believe my colleague has done
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
a wonderful job in correcting this issue
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh to the in in the spirit of the way
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
that the other body sent it to us which
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
i in this case i agree with
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
i don't always agree with the other body
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
but this time they did a good job almost
 
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.030 align:start position:0%
but this time they did a good job almost
so

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
is it not true that what we're trying to
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
do here is protect the
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
the long-term interests the possible you
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
know educational outcomes and careers of
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
our stu of our high school students
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
while they're working
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
but only by limiting their hours during
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
the school year
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
when they have school the next day so
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
that they will not be
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh working and driving home at late
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
hours and risking their future
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know for the
 
00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.069 align:start position:0%
you know for the
problem

00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me i mean we all have we all have
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
most of us have kids some of us you know
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
have grandkids and maybe we'd like to
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
have them get a good education and make
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
the best of their lives
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
this is this is important you know so
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the restaurant industry
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
needing help but there's help available
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
and they can they can do it
 
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have to have the t the case
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
is is it not true that kids can do a
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
good job until nine o'clock in the
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
school representative it is a question
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
yes three and we're recognized for a
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
question thanks sir is it not true that
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
the restaurant industry will benefit
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
from having these kids there until nine
 
00:58:22.559 --> 00:58:23.510 align:start position:0%
from having these kids there until nine
o'clock

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
and isn't that not sufficient to meet
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
their needs and the needs of our
 
00:58:27.359 --> 00:58:30.710 align:start position:0%

youths that are working a schedule now

to abandon that

schedule and if i also know that because
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
of the interaction of the various

sections of the law what this amendment
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
would do is make the rules for 16 and 17
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
year olds stricter than the rules for 14

interpreted the phrase enrolled in

figure out why on earth this chamber
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
would seek to alleviate
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
mr speaker tens of thousands of new
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens live in what sb 246
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
calls private qualified communities
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
often these are developments with dozens
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
of homes and many miles of roads
 
01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
sidewalks and other general
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure including sewer systems
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
open space and runoff drainage systems
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
outside of these communities
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities shoulder the burden of
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
maintaining the kind of infrastructure
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
but in so-called private communities
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners themselves are responsible
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
for these expenses
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
in addition to paying property taxes at
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
the same rate as their neighbors on
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
public streets
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
to be sure buying into such a community
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
is a choice
 
01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
and most people understand that they
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
will have to subsidize certain services
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
that are normally addressed
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
by cities and towns
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
that is not the issue here
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
the issue is one of time
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
time sufficient for a community to build
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
up the kind of capital reserves that
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
will inevitably need be needed when it's
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
time to pave roads and repair retaining
 
01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.750 align:start position:0%
time to pave roads and repair retaining
walls

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
walls
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
sb 246 gives communities that time
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
in requiring developers to deposit funds
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
in escrow that would cover 50 percent of
 
01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
the community's road repair expenses
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
should those roads fail earlier than
 
01:28:31.679 --> 01:28:33.750 align:start position:0%
should those roads fail earlier than
expected

01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
expected
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
this bill also gives developers and
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
planning boards a choice
 
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
to substitute that escrow amount with a
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee that community roads will be
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
built to municipal standards
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
providing extra assurance that they will
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
not fail prematurely and potentially
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
sb 246 would help new hampshire in other
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
ways as well
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
at a time when more and more new homes
 
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
are being built in such communities
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire continues to be one of
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
only a few states in the nation with no
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
body of law that specifically addresses
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
developing that legislation is very much
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
overdue in our state and sb 246 gives us
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
an excellent starting point
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations and communities
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
like them
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
need two things at this moment
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
new ones need time to establish strong

01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
one of the main issues is the disclosure

of the purchase agreement originally
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%

less than the normal width
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
in many cases to lower the price of a
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
house lot and also the house itself
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
to introduce legislation to have a
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
developer put money into escrow to
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
maintain that road would just drive the
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
price of the house higher
 
01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:42.629 align:start position:0%
price of the house higher
and

01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%

01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
the committee minority i've said
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
majority felt this would just raise the
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
prices in new hampshire and make them
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
the majority report of inexpensive to

01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.120 --> 01:33:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:17.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:31.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
members will be in their seats this is a
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
reported in expedia to legislate on
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill 246.
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker colleagues
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
that having a road of proper width
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
is vital for the safety of a community
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that the expense
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
of repairing
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
roads is enormous
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
and if i also know
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
that members of the residents who live
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
in qualified private communities are
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
paying for the repair of roads
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
throughout their communities and their
 
01:35:02.159 --> 01:35:03.750 align:start position:0%
throughout their communities and their
taxes

01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
do not necessarily get the same benefit
 
01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:07.430 align:start position:0%
do not necessarily get the same benefit
themselves

01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
would i then vote against
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
the motion of an expedient to legislate
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
so that a different motion can be made
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative dolan
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
if i know condo owners often pay taxes
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
to a municipality but services are
 
01:35:36.639 --> 01:35:37.910 align:start position:0%
to a municipality but services are
limited

01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
limited
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
and if i know
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
this is the agreement
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
often established as the units are being
 
01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:44.870 align:start position:0%
often established as the units are being
built

01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
built
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
and if i know this will shift
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
tax payments away from condo owners
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
and if i know that maintaining the roads
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
will need to be added to town
 
01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.270 align:start position:0%
will need to be added to town
responsibility

01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
and taxpayer cost while the roads are
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
often substandard
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
then wouldn't i press the green button
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%

01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative kelly fez can you hang on
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
for a sec i see like eight conversations
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
going on let's take those out to the
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:45.030 align:start position:0%
and you don't look too old to me
representative

01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
the youth council is very important this
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
council would only meet quarterly
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
it would ask for us for advice
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
which is admirable in our youth
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
they will ask us for guidance and they
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
will give us their thoughts on what we
 
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
need to do for the future of our state
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
this council will cost
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:13.109 align:start position:0%
the state
zero

01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
i for one
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
would volunteer if they wanted me
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
to meet with them quarterly
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
i think this is a very good idea this is
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
a step forward
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
now we have other youth groups that are
 
01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:28.709 align:start position:0%
now we have other youth groups that are
involved

01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:59:31.189 --> 01:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
but this one is very important they're
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
going to talk about energy they're going
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
to talk about the future that they see
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that i or we see
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
this cost nothing
 
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to please overturn the
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
give this council a chance
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
these children
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i call them children because i'm
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
again old
 
01:59:54.239 --> 01:59:55.109 align:start position:0%
again old
they

01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:59:55.119 --> 01:59:56.149 align:start position:0%
they
were

01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
so eloquent
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
in their appeal
 
02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
it i think it dazzled most of us
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
they asked us for help
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
they asked us for guidance
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
they asked us for legitimacy
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
legitimize their efforts now they can
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
all do this alone on the schools
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
but isn't it wonderful if all of them
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
from all parts of the state
 
02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
can get together
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
and share their ideas equally
 
02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:27.430 align:start position:0%
and share their ideas equally

considered the same and being unable to
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to

committee report of interim study are
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%

02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
the division has been requested a roll
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
call has been requested is there some

thank you
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker honorable members
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the house
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
i rise to oppose the interim study for
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
sb 269.
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
simple bill it calls for a
 
02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:08.790 align:start position:0%
simple bill it calls for a
commission

02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
to study the best practices for
 
02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:13.350 align:start position:0%
to study the best practices for
weatherization

02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
weatherization
 
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
if you're like me and you listen to the
 
02:09:18.550 --> 02:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock news in the evening on a
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
certain local channel
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
you will hear a commercial very often
 
02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:24.629 align:start position:0%
you will hear a commercial very often
played

02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
played
 
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
by a company not named here but that
 
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
says are you cold in the winter are you
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
warm in the summer
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
your problem is not that you need a new
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
house but you need better insulation
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
and this is what this commission would
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
do this commission would try to look for
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
the best practices to weatherize your
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
home to make it as efficient as possible
 
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
thereby driving down the demand for
 
02:09:53.750 --> 02:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
energy in your house
 
02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:55.990 align:start position:0%
energy in your house
now

02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
when it comes to paying money
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
you don't want to pay more money to heat
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
your house than you have to so if you
 
02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
release your demand
 
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
now that means you don't need as much
 
02:10:08.639 --> 02:10:09.750 align:start position:0%
now that means you don't need as much
supply

02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
supply
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter how efficient your
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
furnace is or your air conditioning is
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
if your house is a leaky house
 
02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's an inefficient house and you're
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
wasting energy and you're wasting money
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
so this bill basically just says let's
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
look at weatherization uh programs and
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
let's see what the best opportunities to
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
minimize your energy costs and save
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
dollars as well
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
and it will come up with recommendations
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
and when those recommendations come out
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
we can always say no to the

honor it is for me to be able to address

02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker mentioned uh this
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
bill attempts to establish a commission
 
02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
to study the energy-saving
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs
 
02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599 align:start position:0%
but uh what the majority of the ste
 
02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
committee found
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
is that this bill should be referred to
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
interim study the reason for that is
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
that during the testimony
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
there were many concerns one of which
 
02:11:45.599 --> 02:11:46.950 align:start position:0%
there were many concerns one of which
was

02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
it was in regards to the unbalanced
 
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
member makeup of the commission there
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
were also concerns about language that
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
said that they would be reducing the
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
contractor pre-qualifications
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
we need to know what that would mean
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
and the costs associated with
 
02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
administrating that process
 
02:12:07.270 --> 02:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
additionally this policy
 
02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh direction
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
is said to that they would explore
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
expanding the fiscal participation of
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
propane and oil users in new hampshire
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
this needs to be better understood
 
02:12:24.550 --> 02:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:26.709 --> 02:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
at all-time high energy prices we
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
certainly don't need any more fees to be
 
02:12:29.199 --> 02:12:30.229 align:start position:0%
certainly don't need any more fees to be
added

02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%

02:12:32.550 --> 02:12:32.560 align:start position:0%

02:19:36.790 --> 02:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment calls for only a
 
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
12-month reprieve of the current
 
02:19:41.190 --> 02:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
financial situation of the burgess
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
biopower plant
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
while a better long-term solution is
 
02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:47.450 align:start position:0%
being developed
 
02:19:47.450 --> 02:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
being developed
[Music]

02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification so i'm
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking on behalf of the amendment
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
i proposed
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
and this amendment
 
02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
contrary to the previous one we just
 
02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:19.349 align:start position:0%
contrary to the previous one we just
heard

02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
does something different for long term
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
for the burgess power plant
 
02:20:25.830 --> 02:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
the majority amendment provides only a
 
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
temporary solution
 
02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
for the operation of the burgess power
 
02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:30.790 align:start position:0%
for the operation of the burgess power
plant

02:20:30.790 --> 02:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
plant
 
02:20:33.670 --> 02:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
it is a mainstay of the regional economy
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
and an essential component of new
 
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire's in-state renewable energy
 
02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.230 align:start position:0%
hampshire's in-state renewable energy
assets

02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
assets
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
committee members were in agreement that
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
a well-designed
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
a well-designed
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
long-term solution is needed
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
however the majority
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
only provides a 12-month reprieve
 
02:20:56.710 --> 02:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
preempting the work of a commission from
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
the natural resources committee which is
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
currently tasked with addressing the
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
overarching issue of the long-term
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
sustainability of our new hampshire
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
timber industry
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
12 months is in my opinion not enough to
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
avoid a shutdown of this facility
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
few businesses when given a 12-month
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
extension of their financial situation
 
02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
would start to make new future business
 
02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:22.389 align:start position:0%
would start to make new future business
plans

02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
plans
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
more likely with such uncertainty they
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
would start planning for an orderly
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
shutdown or for a sale
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
according to the majority amendment
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
during those 12 months various actions
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
by the puc and the department of energy
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
need to be undertaken as well as a plan
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
b developed
 
02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
the last time the puc dealt with burgess
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
it took them 18 months to certify the
 
02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:48.309 align:start position:0%
it took them 18 months to certify the
settlement

02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then their interpretation of the
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
legislation was incorrect according to
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
the burgess power plant owners and the
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
original sponsor of sb 271
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
this plant is a 75 megawatt sustainable
 
02:22:06.309 --> 02:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
reliable base load energy generator
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
capable of providing enough electricity
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
for 10 percent of new hampshire homes
 
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
it uses waste and low-grade wood that is
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
locally sourced
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
it is also certified to receive
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits as an energy
 
02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:22.550 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits as an energy
generator

02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
generator
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
besides providing over 240 jobs in the
 
02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
north country it also provides services
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
to the entire forest and lumber industry
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
which includes all counties in new
 
02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:34.309 align:start position:0%
which includes all counties in new

02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
it generates more than 83
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
are we getting to the point where you
 
02:22:41.349 --> 02:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
tell us what your amendment does yes we
 
02:22:41.359 --> 02:22:42.150 align:start position:0%
tell us what your amendment does yes we
are

02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
02:22:46.389 --> 02:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
it generates over 83 million dollars in
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
labor income and the economy economic
 
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
activity in our state and even shares
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
its profits with the local host
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
the far too short time horizon uh that
 
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
is given by the uh by the previous
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
in contrast to mine places these vital
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
elements of our state economy in
 
02:23:08.240 --> 02:23:09.429 align:start position:0%
elements of our state economy in
jeopardy

02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
jeopardy
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
the existence of low-grade wood market
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
is not only an economic uh req requisite
 
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
for the forest sector but also ensures
 
02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
the health and in a large part of our
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
currently it is the largest renewable
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
energy plant in new hampshire shutting
 
02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
it down would mean turning our backs on
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
our locally based renewable energy
 
02:23:36.790 --> 02:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
source and increasing reliance on fossil
 
02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:38.630 align:start position:0%
source and increasing reliance on fossil
fuels

02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
fuels
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
my floor amendment provides 24 months
 
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
which would be an adequate time to
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
develop a financial survival plan
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
if we truly want to save this critical
 
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
energy so resource and safeguard our
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
major sector of the new hampshire
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
economy we need to give this plant a
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
fighting chance
 
02:23:59.190 --> 02:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
and that is why i ask you now to press
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
the red button to reject
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
sorry the green button to support my
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
floor amendment and mr speaker i asked
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.309 --> 02:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is recognized
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
to speak against the floor amendment
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
this uh amendment would increase what i
 
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
would call the bleeding that we've been
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
experiencing now for quite some time
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
with the burgess biomass plan it would
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
increase this
 
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
not 12 months as he was just stated but
 
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:34.950 align:start position:0%
not 12 months as he was just stated but
18

02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
18
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment has passed was 18 months
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
this would extend it to two and a half
 
02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
years because the effective date is
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
november of this year and the date would
 
02:24:46.469 --> 02:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
be a year from that under the
 
02:24:49.030 --> 02:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
other amendment and under the one minute
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about now would be two
 
02:24:52.389 --> 02:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
years from then so that's two and a half
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
years now why do i say stop the bleeding
 
02:24:57.190 --> 02:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
this plan has been in his existence for
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
quite some time it signed a contract
 
02:25:01.270 --> 02:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
willingly signed a contract that it
 
02:25:02.950 --> 02:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
pursued and now it doesn't want to live
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
up to the terms of that contract
 
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
the contract has now where they owe the
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
rate payers of new hampshire over 50
 
02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars and it's time to pay it
 
02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
back they don't want to pay it back so
 
02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
their response was
 
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
have a bill which came out of the senate
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
which we were told by the main spawn
 
02:25:22.630 --> 02:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
sorry the people on the other side of
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
the wall
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
i was told by the main sponsor that
 
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes whatever it costs we
 
02:25:29.750 --> 02:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
need to do to keep this plant operating
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
which is obviously silly
 
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
this plant is not viable under its
 
02:25:36.070 --> 02:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
present ownership giving them a year
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
from november is a gift it allows them
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
to spend a year looking into the only
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
viable option which is sale of the plant
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
this should not be a shock they've been
 
02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
operating at a loss for as long as
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
they've been there and they will
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
continue to operate at a loss and that
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
debt to the rate pays will continue to
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
build up it's we've been paying extra
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
money and extra money and we'll continue
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
to do it the question is we do it for
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
another year from november or two years
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
from november
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
well i say the only viable thing is sale
 
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
when you look at the their report that
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
biomass burgess biomass just put out
 
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
they look at long-term solutions and
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
they say challenges posed by the default
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
service bidding requirements proved too
 
02:26:15.840 --> 02:26:16.710 align:start position:0%
service bidding requirements proved too
great

02:26:16.710 --> 02:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
and they go on to talk about other
 
02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
possibilities of using their waste heat
 
02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
for various things and they say
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is
 
02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
no one is willing to put capital at risk
 
02:26:29.349 --> 02:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
to develop a project which relies on a
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
power plant with uncertain future in
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
other words no one will spend their
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
money but they want you to spend
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
ratepayers money on this
 
02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
selling power plants is something that
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
happens all the time in new england i
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
think most of
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
the power plants have been sold
 
02:26:46.630 --> 02:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
once or twice normally at a loss let me
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
give you for example the londonderry
 
02:26:50.150 --> 02:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
plant in southern new hampshire it's a
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
natural fire gas plant ten times the
 
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
size of this plant
 
02:26:56.309 --> 02:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
and that was sold basically the original
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
owners walked away and told the bank
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's yours we can't make a profit at it
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's been subsequently sold a couple of
 
02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:03.750 align:start position:0%
it's been subsequently sold a couple of
times

02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
times
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
and is now operated by calpine at a
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
profit so the only long-term plan for
 
02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
this is sale
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
and they can work on that in an a year
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
and a half to develop people to come in
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
and purchase that is enough time it's
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
time to stop the bleeding the rate
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
payers have paid too much they're never
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
going to get their 50 million dollars
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
back one way or the other but let's not
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
add more to the bill and please press
 
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
red on this amendment thank you
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
the questions on floor amendment 1894-h
 
02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
a division vote's been requested this
 
02:27:38.309 --> 02:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
will be a division vote members please
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:49.120 --> 02:28:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
the question is on floor amendment
 
02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:07.110 align:start position:0%
the question is on floor amendment
1894-h

02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
1894-h
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative samson is recognized for
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:30.630 --> 02:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mr speaker
 
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
that there are two options here and we
 
02:29:37.030 --> 02:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
just heard that
 
02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
there might be an eminence sale
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
so if if
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
if i know that my floor amendment will
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
provide more time for this facility to
 
02:29:47.670 --> 02:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
stay in
 
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
in business
 
02:29:52.309 --> 02:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
and if i know also that this is the only
 
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
and the largest renewable energy plant
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
we have in this state it's an in-state
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
energy resource not an out-of-state fuel
 
02:29:59.680 --> 02:30:00.710 align:start position:0%
energy resource not an out-of-state fuel
source

02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
source
 
02:30:02.469 --> 02:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
if i know all that and i wish to keep
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
the plant open and not sell it would i
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
now vote
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative is recognized for
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:19.830 --> 02:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:30:23.190 --> 02:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know the extension
 
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
that burgess biopower was granted by
 
02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 577 back in 2018
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
has given them plenty of time to come up
 
02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
with a solution
 
02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
to this problem
 
02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
and if i further know
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
that giving them two more years
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
is not going to help them find a
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
solution to this problem because it
 
02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
removes the sense of urgency
 
02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that adding
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
another year to this cap beyond the one
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
that our committee amendment provides
 
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
we'll add another 20 million dollars to
 
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
ever source ratepayers
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
costs for this bill
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
would i press the red button and vote no
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
on this floor amendment thank you mr
 
02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:13.270 align:start position:0%
on this floor amendment thank you mr
speaker

02:31:13.270 --> 02:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to adopt floor
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
amendment 1894-h
 
02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote if you're in
 
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
favor you'll press the green button if
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
you're opposed you'll press the red
 
02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
button voting stations are open for 30
 
02:31:23.439 --> 02:31:33.830 align:start position:0%
button voting stations are open for 30
seconds

02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:49.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:54.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:31:54.110 --> 02:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:57.510 align:start position:0%

02:31:59.190 --> 02:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
of all members president an opportunity
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
the house will attend to the state of
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
02:32:05.750 --> 02:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
143 in the affirmative 190 in the
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
negative the amendment fails
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're back now to the majority committee
 
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
report of octopass with amendment are
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
you ready for the question all those in
 
02:32:16.710 --> 02:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
favor say aye
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
all those opposed nay
 
02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:19.840 align:start position:0%

02:33:03.920 --> 02:33:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

02:33:40.230 --> 02:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
also be in order
 
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
majority committee on science technology
 
02:33:46.870 --> 02:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
and energy to which was referred senate
 
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
bill 2 424 fn an act relative to
 
02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and natural gas
 
02:33:54.070 --> 02:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same with
 
02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that the bill ought
 
02:33:56.550 --> 02:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
02:33:58.150 --> 02:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
john leakey for the majority of the
 
02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:00.230 align:start position:0%
john leakey for the majority of the
committee

02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee and considered
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
the same being unable to agree with the
 
02:34:05.670 --> 02:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
majority report with the following
 
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
resolution resolved that has been
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate jim lucas parcell
 
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
do you reckon
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
for what reason to remember rise
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
i recognize european press
 
02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
to speak against the committee report
 
02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:10.710 align:start position:0%
to speak against the committee report
yes

02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
renewable natural gas is a bad
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
description for a worse idea
 
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's a feel-good green washing
 
02:35:21.510 --> 02:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
of what is actually very expensive to
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
produce biomethane
 
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
in fact our current fossil drive natural
 
02:35:29.990 --> 02:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
gas pricing would have to increase
 
02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
six times its present level
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
to make biomethane broadly affordable
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then only a modest supplement to our
 
02:35:42.630 --> 02:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
with methane leakage
 
02:35:47.270 --> 02:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
at an all-time high this bill makes bad
 
02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
environmental sense
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
methane is less than a tenth of the

02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
it is important to understand
 
02:36:17.429 --> 02:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
what this bill isn't
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
there are efforts underway to churn
 
02:36:22.550 --> 02:36:22.560 align:start position:0%

to electricity
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
arguably this may not be as desirable as
 
02:36:35.830 --> 02:36:35.840 align:start position:0%

but neither is it what this bill is
addressing

02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:43.590 align:start position:0%
 
indeed

02:36:43.590 --> 02:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
indeed
 
02:36:45.590 --> 02:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
this bill sets the definition of
 
02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
mislabeled renewable natural gas to
 
02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
require that the finished product
 
02:36:53.190 --> 02:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
to meet pipe time quality standards or

transportation fuel grade
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
this will require dedicated and

02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:07.349 align:start position:0%
highly susceptible to leakage and
potentially

02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
02:37:11.910 --> 02:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
to the last point
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
this bill makes bad economic sense
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
it will be left to the public utilities
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%

shifted

02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
shifted
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
from the utilities to the ratepayers
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
this bill pretty much represents a blank
 
02:37:37.270 --> 02:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
if successful the industry shareholders
 
02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
will benefit
 
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
if it fails
 
02:37:45.030 --> 02:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
the ratepayers foot the bill
 
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
i know that many of us agree
 
02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
this is not exactly how the free
 
02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
enterprise system is meant to work
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
so i urge you to defeat the ought to
 
02:37:55.750 --> 02:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
pass recommendation
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
so that we can reconsider our
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
willingness to engage in bad economics
 
02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:20.550 --> 02:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill 424 is it
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
senate bill 424 is an enabling piece of
 
02:38:31.270 --> 02:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that would allow the state's
 
02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
natural gas utilities to procure a
 
02:38:35.830 --> 02:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
certain amount of renewable natural gas
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
known as
 
02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
rng with pre-approval from the public
 
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
renewable natural gas is created from
 
02:38:45.750 --> 02:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
decomposing organic matter
 
02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
the gas which would otherwise be emitted
 
02:38:50.389 --> 02:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
into the air as methane is captured and
 
02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
purified so that it meets the same
 
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
standards as conventional natural gas
 
02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
it can be created from animal waste food
 
02:39:00.469 --> 02:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
waste landfills low-grade wood and other
 
02:39:00.479 --> 02:39:01.590 align:start position:0%

sources

02:39:01.590 --> 02:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
sources
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation creates the ability for
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
gas utilities to incorporate rng into
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
their supply while also allowing the
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
state to benefit from local investments
 
02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
local job creation and local energy
 
02:39:13.280 --> 02:39:15.349 align:start position:0%

options

02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
options
 
02:39:17.110 --> 02:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
this creates a winning solution for new
 
02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses to invest in rng
 
02:39:21.270 --> 02:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
market while preserving energy choice
 
02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
and optimizing our existing energy
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
distribution system
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is the work product of a
 
02:39:29.110 --> 02:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
robust group including the department of
 
02:39:31.349 --> 02:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
energy and has brought bipartisan
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
support from legislators and stakeholder
 
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
groups alike
 
02:39:37.190 --> 02:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
it allows the gas utilities to procure
 
02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
up to five percent of rng with
 
02:39:41.349 --> 02:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
pre-approval by the public utilities
 
02:39:43.590 --> 02:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
commission and after demonstrating that
 
02:39:45.510 --> 02:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
it is in the public interest to do so by
 
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
means of a public interest test
 
02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
it also requires the utilities to work
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
with the department of energy in issuing
 
02:39:56.389 --> 02:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
requests for proposal to procure rng
 
02:39:58.389 --> 02:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
further this bill requires a study to be
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
conducted by the department of energy no
 
02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
less than three years after this
 
02:40:04.389 --> 02:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
legislation takes effect in order to
 
02:40:05.990 --> 02:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
study all the impacts of this
 
02:40:08.469 --> 02:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
legislation may have including benefits
 
02:40:11.190 --> 02:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
to the state any impact to ratepayers
 
02:40:13.590 --> 02:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
and an assessment of the existing rng
 
02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:15.030 align:start position:0%
and an assessment of the existing rng
market

02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
market
 
02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation allows
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
the state to begin to explore the
 
02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
benefits of utilizing drop-in energy
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
resources like rng
 
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
and how these sources can be green our
 
02:40:28.230 --> 02:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
pipeline without a subsidy or mandate
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
and with proper guardrails put in place
 
02:40:33.670 --> 02:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
by this bill i ask you to support sb424
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%

02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:31.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:42:31.990 --> 02:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:42:50.070 --> 02:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:52.950 --> 02:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
house will be in order
 
02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:57.200 align:start position:0%

thank you miss thank you mr speaker uh
 
02:43:12.309 --> 02:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
honorable members
 
02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
um if i know
 
02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
that while i am a co-sponsor of this
 
02:43:17.359 --> 02:43:18.230 align:start position:0%
that while i am a co-sponsor of this
bill

02:43:18.230 --> 02:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
i have now come to the conclusion that
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
this bill needs more work
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
and if i further know that using
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
renewable natural gas from landfills and
 
02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
other sources
 
02:43:30.870 --> 02:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
could be a a very useful con
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
contributor to our energy future
 
02:43:36.309 --> 02:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
and if i also know however that
 
02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
considering the reorganization of the
 
02:43:41.349 --> 02:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
puc and the department of energy it is
 
02:43:43.349 --> 02:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
not clear that rate payers will be
 
02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
properly protected
 
02:43:47.670 --> 02:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
against investing in such
 
02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:48.710 align:start position:0%
against investing in such
currently

02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
not mature technologies
 
02:43:53.190 --> 02:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
and finally while i believe we should
 
02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
continue to pursue this idea i think at
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
this point it's not ready and we should
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
table this bill thank you
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
02:44:13.349 --> 02:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
know this carefully considered and

worded bill
 
02:44:17.830 --> 02:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
is enabling legislation
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
that provides us with the opportunity to
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
create a new renewable resource
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
which is badly needed in our state
 
02:44:28.389 --> 02:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:30.150 --> 02:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that we've already
 
02:44:33.269 --> 02:44:33.279 align:start position:0%
heard the debate on this issue
 
02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
and we can easily make up our minds on
 
02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not to pass this bill
 
02:44:40.469 --> 02:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
but i now press the red button
 
02:44:42.550 --> 02:44:42.560 align:start position:0%

02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
if all members president had an
 
02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote house will tend to
 
02:45:55.670 --> 02:45:55.680 align:start position:0%

that all the costs of the development
 
02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
and implementation of renewable natural
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
gas technology will be totally
 
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
paid for by the ratepayers and if i know
 
02:47:38.870 --> 02:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
that the cost of renewable natural gas
 
02:47:40.790 --> 02:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
is up to eight times the cost of

conventional natural gas
 
02:47:44.550 --> 02:47:44.560 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that renewable
 
02:48:09.349 --> 02:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
02:48:12.230 --> 02:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
benefits both gas utility customers and
 
02:48:14.790 --> 02:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
the public and also offsets
 
02:48:17.030 --> 02:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
and reduces the naturally occurring
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
emissions and waste streams
 
02:48:21.670 --> 02:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
if i further believe and know
 
02:48:23.349 --> 02:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
that this is consistent with and
 
02:48:25.830 --> 02:48:25.840 align:start position:0%

04:08:24.239 --> 04:08:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:08:39.910 --> 04:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:53.670 --> 04:08:53.680 align:start position:0%

04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
recommendation the bill ought to pass
 
04:09:21.670 --> 04:09:21.680 align:start position:0%

04:09:31.030 --> 04:09:31.040 align:start position:0%

04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you respected
 
04:09:43.110 --> 04:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues this is a simple two-part
 
04:09:43.120 --> 04:09:44.229 align:start position:0%
colleagues this is a simple two-part
bill

04:09:44.229 --> 04:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:09:45.910 --> 04:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
the first thing that this bill does is
 
04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
provides language instructing the state
 
04:09:49.590 --> 04:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
to consider energy efficiency when
 
04:09:51.269 --> 04:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
making decisions about renovating
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
constructing purchasing or leasing
 
04:09:53.520 --> 04:09:54.790 align:start position:0%
constructing purchasing or leasing
buildings

04:09:54.790 --> 04:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
04:09:56.550 --> 04:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
if you recall just a few months ago this
 
04:09:58.950 --> 04:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
body voted unanimously on a bill to
 
04:10:01.030 --> 04:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
preserve the new hampshire saves program
 
04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
because we all agree how important
 
04:10:04.469 --> 04:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
promoting energy efficiency is to the
 
04:10:06.309 --> 04:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
citizens of our state for both
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
environmental and economic reasons
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the state itself is
 
04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
considering and taking advantage of
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
these opportunities for long-term
 
04:10:17.110 --> 04:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
savings is an easy win
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
the other important thing that this bill
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
accomplishes is provides language
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
necessary for the director of the
 
04:10:24.630 --> 04:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
state's vehicle fleets to take certain
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
actions supporting a transition to low
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
or no emission vehicles this is also a
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
bipartisan goal
 
04:10:32.710 --> 04:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
touted by the governor in his state of
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
the state speech earlier this year
 
04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
importantly this bill would allow the
 
04:10:38.149 --> 04:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
establishment of electric vehicle
 
04:10:40.229 --> 04:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
equipment and supply sites for state
 
04:10:42.309 --> 04:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles this would allow state fleet
 
04:10:43.990 --> 04:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles to serve as part of our energy
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
grid which is a critical part of our
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
grid modernization strategy
 
04:10:50.149 --> 04:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
these simple steps make good economic
 
04:10:52.229 --> 04:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
sense for the state
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
so most of us drove here today i know we
 
04:10:55.990 --> 04:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
are all acutely aware of the recent
 
04:10:58.229 --> 04:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
volatility and increases in fossil fuel
 
04:10:58.239 --> 04:10:59.189 align:start position:0%
volatility and increases in fossil fuel
prices

taking steps to reduce our energy needs
 
04:11:02.550 --> 04:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
and expenditures as a state should be
 
04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
something that we can all get behind i
 
04:11:05.910 --> 04:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote no on the committee
 
04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation of itl so that we can
 
04:11:09.429 --> 04:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
pass this simple enabling legislation
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%

04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:11:27.429 --> 04:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
mr speaker the focus of this bill is
 
04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
energy policy is found in rsa 21 1
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
colon 19.
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
it declares the policy of new hampshire
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
to pry is to prioritize public health
 
04:11:40.630 --> 04:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
and environmental quality while
 
04:11:43.269 --> 04:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
maximizing economic benefits
 
04:11:46.229 --> 04:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
through use of economical energy
 
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
measures in the construction renovation
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
operation maintenance of property owned
 
04:11:53.510 --> 04:11:53.520 align:start position:0%

everything from weatherization to
 
04:11:55.439 --> 04:11:57.830 align:start position:0%
everything from weatherization to

04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
automobiles
 
04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
the proponents of this bill
 
04:12:02.149 --> 04:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
would mandate that all state vehicle
 
04:12:05.550 --> 04:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
purchases or leases be zero emission by
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
2025 if feasible practical
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
and cost effective
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
yet this standard is not applied
 
04:12:17.110 --> 04:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole bill it often in
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
various sections only requires
 
04:12:19.760 --> 04:12:22.309 align:start position:0%
various sections only requires
feasibility

04:12:22.309 --> 04:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
feasibility
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
the bill presumes electric vehicles evs
 
04:12:29.189 --> 04:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
are the most economic operationally
 
04:12:32.469 --> 04:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
efficient and environmentally clean
 
04:12:35.189 --> 04:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
proponents fail to recognize
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
the acquisition of the raw materials for
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
batteries and evs
 
04:12:42.950 --> 04:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
is intensively energy consumptive and
 
04:12:47.349 --> 04:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
tremendously environmentally destructive
 
04:12:49.830 --> 04:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
proponents will suggest that we should
 
04:12:52.149 --> 04:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
reduce our reliance on out-of-state
 
04:12:53.910 --> 04:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
energy resources
 
04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
yet solar panels windmills and batteries
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
or their components are essentially all
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
made out of state
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
they would have a send our money to
 
04:13:04.080 --> 04:13:05.269 align:start position:0%
they would have a send our money to
china

04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
china
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
and say that we're keeping it here
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
proponents consider evs to be pollution
 
04:13:14.469 --> 04:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
free yet they ignore the fact
 
04:13:16.389 --> 04:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
that the power they use comes
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
essentially from natural gas uranium oil
 
04:13:22.710 --> 04:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
or coal
 
04:13:24.870 --> 04:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
proponents further disregard that new
 
04:13:27.429 --> 04:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire's electric capacity is
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
seriously limited during peak power
 
04:13:32.710 --> 04:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
demands during prolonged winter cold
 
04:13:32.720 --> 04:13:33.990 align:start position:0%
demands during prolonged winter cold
snaps

04:13:33.990 --> 04:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
snaps
 
04:13:36.389 --> 04:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
just when we don't need our emergency
 
04:13:36.399 --> 04:13:38.830 align:start position:0%
just when we don't need our emergency
vehicles

04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
04:13:43.030 --> 04:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
offline we have no significant new power
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
production sources coming online in the
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
near future
 
04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
california the most
 
04:13:53.590 --> 04:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
active advocate for transition to evs
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
now has to often tell their citizens
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
please don't charge your car right now
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
we don't need to push our citizens into
 
04:14:09.269 --> 04:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
rolling winter blackouts with a big new
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%

run evs
 
04:14:16.389 --> 04:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
finally and probably most importantly no
 
04:14:18.550 --> 04:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
additional legislation is required for
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
any state agency to choose the most
 
04:14:24.550 --> 04:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
practical cost-effective and economical
 
04:14:28.149 --> 04:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
vehicles no ev mandate is required
 
04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
please vote green to itless bill thank

thank you mr speaker
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the state of

new hampshire has been implementing
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
robust energy efficiency
 
04:17:02.070 --> 04:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
measures for its public buildings since
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
before i came became a member of this
 
04:17:04.080 --> 04:17:05.830 align:start position:0%
before i came became a member of this
body

04:17:05.830 --> 04:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
body
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that the battery
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
accounts for 30 to forty percent of the
 
04:17:13.590 --> 04:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
cost of an electric vehicle
 
04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
if i further know that the price of
 
04:17:17.269 --> 04:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
lithium carbonate which is a key
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
component of such batteries
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
has increased in cost from six thousand
 
04:17:26.070 --> 04:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
dollars a ton in 2015 to a ridiculous 70
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
000 a ton in 2022
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that the cost of a 60
 
04:17:35.110 --> 04:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour battery sufficient
 
04:17:37.990 --> 04:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
to power a large sport utility vehicle
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
has risen from thirteen hundred and
 
04:17:42.550 --> 04:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
ninety five dollars to seven thousand
 
04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
four hundred dollars in the last year an
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
increase of four hundred and thirty
 
04:17:46.560 --> 04:17:49.189 align:start position:0%
increase of four hundred and thirty
percent

04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
and finally if i believe that statistics
 
04:17:53.429 --> 04:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
like these mean that the future of
 
04:17:56.309 --> 04:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles remains volatile and
 
04:17:56.319 --> 04:17:58.070 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles remains volatile and
unpredictable

04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
unpredictable
 
04:17:59.830 --> 04:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
but i now press the green button to
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that new hampshire proceeds
 
04:18:04.870 --> 04:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
cautiously down the electric vehicle
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%

the american term gerrymander
 
04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
is literally in my backyard back in

hoping that we could restore our party's

long tradition of the politics of
 
04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%

both parties

gerrymandered states and but voters
 
04:22:19.269 --> 04:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
supported republicans in an effort to
 
04:22:21.990 --> 04:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
stop this terrible practice
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
technically it is impossible to
 
04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
gerrymander one or two districts but the
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
public has rarely heard
 
04:22:31.910 --> 04:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
this proposal of proportional districts
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
before the election
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
and were not given sufficient notice it
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
was only mentioned once or twice in the
 
04:22:37.600 --> 04:22:38.870 align:start position:0%
was only mentioned once or twice in the

04:22:38.870 --> 04:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
news
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
neither the governor nor the senate has
 
04:22:42.950 --> 04:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
argued for the idea of proportional
 
04:22:42.960 --> 04:22:45.030 align:start position:0%
argued for the idea of proportional

04:22:45.030 --> 04:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
nor even explained it to the public and
 
04:22:48.870 --> 04:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto threat shows
 
04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
no understanding in those public
 
04:22:52.229 --> 04:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
statements of this approach nor the
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
important debate that's behind it
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
this i-93 district may come to be known
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
by the public as the kenny mccormick
 
04:23:01.750 --> 04:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
district the famous orange clad
 
04:23:03.990 --> 04:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
inaudible character from south park
 
04:23:08.229 --> 04:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
but kenny
 
04:23:11.670 --> 04:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
in the show south park was always
 
04:23:13.990 --> 04:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
muffled and died in each episode as a
 
04:23:15.110 --> 04:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
running gag
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
and this amendment kills retail politics
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire by creating two long
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
boundary districts where candidates must
 
04:23:25.590 --> 04:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
spend money in five different television
 
04:23:27.030 --> 04:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
markets forcing our congressional
 
04:23:28.950 --> 04:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
delegation to raise tens of millions of
 
04:23:28.960 --> 04:23:29.990 align:start position:0%
delegation to raise tens of millions of
dollars

04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%

several years ago
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
i admit that i suggested proportional
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
districting to a committee of this body
 
04:23:41.189 --> 04:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
and have come to regret it
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
after doing more research we've come to
 
04:23:42.960 --> 04:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
after doing more research we've come to
find

04:23:43.990 --> 04:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
find
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
that heavily republican and democrat
 
04:23:48.070 --> 04:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
leaning districts around the country
 
04:23:50.550 --> 04:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
produce the worst representation and the
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
least competition stifling the will of
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
the voters and muffling them in november
 
04:23:57.510 --> 04:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
if these entrenched partly line
 
04:23:59.110 --> 04:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
districts produce the worst beltway
 
04:24:00.630 --> 04:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
congress critters
 
04:24:02.950 --> 04:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
why would we create two more of them
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
why make congressional district races
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
more expensive putting our congressional
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
delegation in the back pockets of out of
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
state in and foreign-moneyed interests
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
that all four men on mount rushmore
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
warned us against
 
04:24:18.630 --> 04:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
drawing another line in the sand won't
 
04:24:21.990 --> 04:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
fix what's gone wrong with our broken
 
04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
system of government in washington dc
 
04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
a great line that wraps around
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
manchester resembling the wall around
 
04:24:31.030 --> 04:24:31.040 align:start position:0%

greek for mob rule
 
04:24:37.110 --> 04:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
ronald reagan once warned that a nation
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
that cannot defend its own borders isn't
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
a nation at all
 
04:24:43.030 --> 04:24:43.040 align:start position:0%

constitutional and moral obligation to
 
04:24:46.870 --> 04:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
craft fair districts
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
that inspire public confidence isn't a

republic at all

mr speaker putting kenny mccormick on a
 
04:24:56.630 --> 04:24:56.640 align:start position:0%

mr speaker
 
04:25:30.950 --> 04:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
this is my map
 
04:25:33.269 --> 04:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
unlike the previous map where
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
i compromised and i tried to vote count
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
and do a map that would pass the body
 
04:25:41.189 --> 04:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
this map
 
04:25:43.269 --> 04:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
was a map that i developed
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
when i released this map
 
04:25:49.590 --> 04:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
someone said i appeared agitated
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
and they were right
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
they thought i was agitated because the
 
04:25:56.710 --> 04:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
minority party was attacking the map
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
they were wrong
 
04:26:00.630 --> 04:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i was agitated because for
 
04:26:04.149 --> 04:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
eight months i sat in hearings about map
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
after map and i heard from the minority
 
04:26:09.189 --> 04:26:09.199 align:start position:0%

and i was agitated mr speaker because i
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
gave them a map that did all of that
 
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
let's talk about the districts mr
 
04:26:22.710 --> 04:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
speaker the current congressional map
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
splits five out of new hampshire's ten
 
04:26:27.030 --> 04:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
counties the minority party thinks
 
04:26:28.950 --> 04:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's a-okay
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
this map mr speaker splits two
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
it keeps eight
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the counties in this state wholly
 
04:26:38.309 --> 04:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
intact a request that the minority party
 
04:26:40.630 --> 04:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
asked for they got it
 
04:26:43.110 --> 04:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
mr speaker this map has the lowest
 
04:26:45.750 --> 04:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
deviation of any map publicly presented
 
04:26:45.760 --> 04:26:47.229 align:start position:0%
deviation of any map publicly presented
there's

04:26:47.229 --> 04:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:26:49.590 --> 04:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
1.377 million people that live in this
 
04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
state and this map has a difference of
 
04:26:52.000 --> 04:26:53.349 align:start position:0%
state and this map has a difference of
nine

04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
nine
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
nine without dividing a single town or
 
04:26:56.399 --> 04:26:57.510 align:start position:0%
nine without dividing a single town or
city

04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
city
 
04:26:58.950 --> 04:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:27:01.750 --> 04:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
this map recognizes the map that
 
04:27:04.590 --> 04:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
recognizes the state as it is today in
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
2022 it is not my fault mr speaker that
 
04:27:11.110 --> 04:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
the i-93 economic corridor is in fact
 
04:27:13.349 --> 04:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
the largest community of interest in
 
04:27:16.309 --> 04:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
this state but currently it is divided
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
it is pulled apart so that the seacoast
 
04:27:20.710 --> 04:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
the second largest economic community of
 
04:27:22.950 --> 04:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
interest as the minority party would say
 
04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
can be remained intact so what does this
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
map do mr speaker it recognizes every
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
economic community and it keeps them
 
04:27:30.960 --> 04:27:32.070 align:start position:0%
economic community and it keeps them
intact

04:27:32.070 --> 04:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
intact
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
my friends on the other side might
 
04:27:35.590 --> 04:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
recognize that keeping communities of
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
interest together was a request that we
 
04:27:40.630 --> 04:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
heard from this well how many times
 
04:27:42.389 --> 04:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
and here it is mr speaker a map that
 
04:27:43.750 --> 04:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
they asked for
 
04:27:47.269 --> 04:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
and they got it and now predictively
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
the truth is revealed they didn't
 
04:27:50.950 --> 04:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
actually want that what they want mr
 
04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
speaker is a map that solidifies their
 
04:27:55.510 --> 04:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
incumbents forever
 
04:27:57.429 --> 04:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
a map mr speaker
 
04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't hold incumbents accountable
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
we just heard mr speaker about how we
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:16.309 --> 04:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
may i continue mr speaker
 
04:28:19.349 --> 04:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
don't don't get into
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
the motive
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
of anybody else the other party or an
 
04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
individual yes mr speaker i will i will
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
do that mr speaker when we speak of
 
04:28:29.040 --> 04:28:30.309 align:start position:0%
do that mr speaker when we speak of
competitive

04:28:30.309 --> 04:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
04:28:33.110 --> 04:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
let's talk about competitive
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
this map produces a congressional
 
04:28:36.790 --> 04:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
district one where the winning party
 
04:28:38.670 --> 04:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
would have won with
 
04:28:42.189 --> 04:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:44.790 --> 04:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
50.05 percent
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
that mr speaker that is competitive but
 
04:28:49.510 --> 04:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
once again
 
04:28:51.990 --> 04:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
we say one thing and sometimes we can do
 
04:28:55.189 --> 04:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
another mr speaker i present to you a
 
04:28:57.670 --> 04:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
map that meets all of the constitutional
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
requirements a map with the lowest
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
deviation that has been publicly
 
04:29:04.149 --> 04:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
released a map that respects what we
 
04:29:07.030 --> 04:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
heard in the hearings
 
04:29:08.469 --> 04:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:29:10.149 --> 04:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
this is a map that represents new
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire from in 2022
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
04:29:25.870 --> 04:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
committee amendment
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
i was waiting for that who requested it
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative barbara griffin requests
 
04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
the roll calls that's it is sufficiently
 
04:30:04.950 --> 04:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:04.960 --> 04:30:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.910 --> 04:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
04:30:56.429 --> 04:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
committee amendment
 
04:30:58.710 --> 04:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
1702 h
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
04:31:04.229 --> 04:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes senator bergeron for
 
04:31:09.670 --> 04:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:12.309 --> 04:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
if i know that this amendment not only
 
04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
places both incumbents in the same
 
04:31:16.399 --> 04:31:17.429 align:start position:0%
places both incumbents in the same
district

04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:31:19.750 --> 04:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
but it moves four of seven of the
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
republican primary opponents
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
of the last congressional district one
 
04:31:26.389 --> 04:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
nominee into another district to the
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
benefit of that 2020 nominee
 
04:31:31.510 --> 04:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
if i know this amendment moves a total
 
04:31:33.429 --> 04:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
of 86 towns
 
04:31:37.349 --> 04:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
and a population of 559 000 people from
 
04:31:40.229 --> 04:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
one congressional district to the other
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
and if i know this amendment still moves
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
the most northern part of the existing
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
congressional district one in carroll
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
county to congressional district two
 
04:31:49.750 --> 04:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
so instead of the north country being
 
04:31:51.510 --> 04:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
represented in congress by both members
 
04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
of congress the plan reduces that to
 
04:31:56.550 --> 04:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
just one and limits their voice of the
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
north country and its residents would i
 
04:32:00.790 --> 04:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
press the red button in opposition to
 
04:32:03.750 --> 04:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
passage of the majority amendment
 
04:32:05.429 --> 04:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative lin for
 
04:32:10.149 --> 04:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i
 
04:32:14.950 --> 04:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
know that this bill redraws or this
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
amendment redraws our two congressional
 
04:32:19.349 --> 04:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
districts in a manner that meets all the
 
04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
requirements that our colleagues across
 
04:32:24.630 --> 04:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
the aisle said a fair redistricting plan
 
04:32:26.790 --> 04:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
should embody and if i know that the
 
04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
population deviation between the
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
districts is the lowest of any plan
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
previously proposed by any party or
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
group that is less than nine people
 
04:32:38.070 --> 04:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
and if i know that unlike the current
 
04:32:40.710 --> 04:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
map which splits over ten
 
04:32:43.269 --> 04:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
over half the counties this plan keeps
 
04:32:45.269 --> 04:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
eight of the ten counties together and
 
04:32:47.830 --> 04:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
does not divide any municipality and if
 
04:32:49.750 --> 04:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
i know that this plan keeps together the
 
04:32:51.990 --> 04:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
economic community
 
04:32:55.110 --> 04:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
comprising the i-93 corridor while also
 
04:32:57.590 --> 04:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
preserving other communities of interest
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
such as the academic communities in
 
04:33:03.510 --> 04:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
durham plymouth hanover and keene and if
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
i know that this plan places together in
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
the same district the three northern
 
04:33:08.080 --> 04:33:09.349 align:start position:0%
the same district the three northern
counties

04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
counties
 
04:33:12.070 --> 04:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
which have shared tourism environmental
 
04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
and forestry related interests
 
04:33:16.470 --> 04:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this plan
 
04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
creates districts that are more
 
04:33:19.990 --> 04:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
competitive than the districts proposed
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
by any other plan and ensures that both
 
04:33:24.869 --> 04:33:24.879 align:start position:0%
of the major parties will have a
 
04:33:26.869 --> 04:33:26.879 align:start position:0%
realistic chance of prevailing in
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
elections over the next 10 years than
 
04:33:31.429 --> 04:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
when i pressed the green button to
 
04:33:37.510 --> 04:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:39.510 --> 04:33:39.520 align:start position:0%

04:35:40.949 --> 04:35:40.959 align:start position:0%
the amendment proposes moving the town
 
04:35:42.629 --> 04:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
of hampstead
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
from the first congressional district to
 
04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
the second
 
04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
according to the 2020 census the
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
population of the existing first
 
04:35:53.949 --> 04:35:53.959 align:start position:0%
congressional district is just 17
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
945 people larger than the population
 
04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the second congressional district
 
04:36:01.349 --> 04:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
thus by moving the town of hampstead and
 
04:36:01.359 --> 04:36:02.189 align:start position:0%
thus by moving the town of hampstead and
its

04:36:02.189 --> 04:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
its
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
8998 residents the resulting population
 
04:36:09.189 --> 04:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
difference is just 51 people
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
an exceptionally low deviation
 
04:36:13.750 --> 04:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
and thus more than 99 of the state's
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
population will continue to reside in
 
04:36:19.269 --> 04:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
their current congressional districts
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of opinions expressed
 
04:36:22.789 --> 04:36:22.799 align:start position:0%
during the public hearings that we held
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
on this and other redistricting bills
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
lumping them all together
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
from all the different redistricting
 
04:36:30.949 --> 04:36:30.959 align:start position:0%
bills that were before our committee and
 
04:36:32.230 --> 04:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
saying that that was the minority
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
position or or some other group's
 
04:36:37.029 --> 04:36:37.039 align:start position:0%
position would be unfair and
 
04:36:39.510 --> 04:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and inaccurate
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
during the redistricting process for
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
the congressional district
 
04:36:46.230 --> 04:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
the health special committee held
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
listening sessions in all 10 counties
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
and conducted a number of public
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
hearings at no time did members of the
 
04:36:53.189 --> 04:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
committee hear calls for the
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
congressional districts to undergo
 
04:36:57.910 --> 04:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
the proposal follows nearly 140 years of
 
04:37:02.230 --> 04:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
precedence in keeping new hampshire
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
congressional districts nearly the same
 
04:37:06.310 --> 04:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
geographically from one decennial
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
redistricting to the next so as not to
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
upset the and displace a lot of
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
residents from one congressional
 
04:37:15.830 --> 04:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
redistricting period to the other
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
the districts will remain competitive
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
in the last 86 elections in the second
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
congressional district republicans have
 
04:37:28.470 --> 04:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
won 71 times democrats have won 15.
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
in the first congressional district the
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
seat changed hands in six of the last
 
04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
eight elections with incumbents losing
 
04:37:37.029 --> 04:37:37.039 align:start position:0%
in five of those races
 
04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
the current districts were created by a
 
04:37:41.349 --> 04:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
republican majority ten years ago they
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
have been and will continue to be
 
04:37:43.039 --> 04:37:45.269 align:start position:0%
have been and will continue to be
competitive

04:37:45.269 --> 04:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
04:37:47.910 --> 04:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
the minority amendment would ensure that
 
04:37:47.920 --> 04:37:48.869 align:start position:0%
the minority amendment would ensure that
every

04:37:48.869 --> 04:37:48.879 align:start position:0%
every
 
04:37:50.470 --> 04:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
announced candidate for new hampshire's
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
u.s congressional congressional
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
districts will continue to reside in the
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
districts in which they have been
 
04:37:55.680 --> 04:37:57.349 align:start position:0%
districts in which they have been
campaigning

04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
campaigning
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
under the majority proposal new
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire's two congressional
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
representatives would be moved into the
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
same district
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
while four candidates for the republican
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
nomination in the first congressional
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
district would be swept out of their
 
04:38:11.590 --> 04:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
district and moved into the second
 
04:38:11.600 --> 04:38:12.629 align:start position:0%
district and moved into the second
district

04:38:12.629 --> 04:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:38:14.551 --> 04:38:14.561 align:start position:0%
thus strengthening the primary campaign
 
04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
for the leading republican fundraising
 
04:38:18.789 --> 04:38:18.799 align:start position:0%
candidate in the first district and
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
forcing four republican congressional
 
04:38:22.789 --> 04:38:22.799 align:start position:0%
candidates to restart their campaign
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
efforts in a different district
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
the filing periods for declarations of
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
candidacy for this year's state primary
 
04:38:31.990 --> 04:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
and general elections begins less than
 
04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
30 days from today
 
04:38:35.670 --> 04:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
every candidate should be able to
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
approach the election on a level playing
 
04:38:38.080 --> 04:38:39.429 align:start position:0%
approach the election on a level playing
field

04:38:39.429 --> 04:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
field
 
04:38:41.189 --> 04:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
the focus of redistricting should be on
 
04:38:43.510 --> 04:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
the voter and not be used to benefit one
 
04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
party or one candidate over another
 
04:38:48.789 --> 04:38:48.799 align:start position:0%
one of the great strengths of the new
 
04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire political system is that in
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house and senate the
 
04:38:55.029 --> 04:38:55.039 align:start position:0%
executive council the governorship
 
04:38:56.949 --> 04:38:56.959 align:start position:0%
voters are able to decide every two
 
04:38:58.709 --> 04:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
years whether whether or not they want
 
04:39:00.390 --> 04:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
to keep an incumbent in office or make a
 
04:39:00.400 --> 04:39:01.830 align:start position:0%
to keep an incumbent in office or make a
change

04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment would protect the rights
 
04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
of all new hampshire voters and
 
04:39:07.029 --> 04:39:07.039 align:start position:0%
candidates to have a fair opportunity to
 
04:39:09.910 --> 04:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
color our state red blue or purple
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
please press the green button
 
04:39:15.429 --> 04:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
in support of amendment 1736
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i would request a
 
04:39:19.750 --> 04:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
04:39:21.990 --> 04:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
recognizer senator barry oh does the
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
member yield to questions
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:32.949 --> 04:39:32.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
we've already voted on this proposal
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
once we shot it down once
 
04:39:41.030 --> 04:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
they referred it as the least change
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
method but it's not actually the least
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
change method it moves one town but it
 
04:39:46.628 --> 04:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't get the lowest deviation
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
possible because you can move the towns
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
of campton sandwich all albany excuse me
 
04:39:53.750 --> 04:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
bartlett hails and hearts from district
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
1 to district 2 and you'd have a
 
04:39:57.430 --> 04:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
deviation of 9 which is what we just
 
04:39:57.440 --> 04:39:58.788 align:start position:0%
deviation of 9 which is what we just
passed

04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:40:02.470 --> 04:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
but mr speaker to the actual proposal as
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
a whole
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
this is a map
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
that divides five out of the ten
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
counties this is a map that divides
 
04:40:10.868 --> 04:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
every economic community except for the
 
04:40:10.878 --> 04:40:12.310 align:start position:0%
every economic community except for the
seacoast

04:40:12.310 --> 04:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
seacoast
 
04:40:13.990 --> 04:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
mr speaker this is a map that was
 
04:40:16.310 --> 04:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
originally designed in 1880 and if you
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
saw the map from 1880 mr speaker you
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recognize it the map from 1880
 
04:40:22.788 --> 04:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
looks nice if the map from 1880 was
 
04:40:24.788 --> 04:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
installed was it was passed today it
 
04:40:27.990 --> 04:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
would be off by 300 000 people because
 
04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
this map
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't recognize the fact that the
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
population of the state has shifted away
 
04:40:33.510 --> 04:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
from the sea coast for those of you
 
04:40:34.948 --> 04:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
history buffs i believe our state
 
04:40:37.670 --> 04:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
capital used to be in the seacoast
 
04:40:40.390 --> 04:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
but mr speaker while it's nice to go
 
04:40:43.110 --> 04:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
back 76 elections the reality is we've
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
only had 10 elections we've only had
 
04:40:47.670 --> 04:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
five elections under the current maps
 
04:40:48.868 --> 04:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
and in those
 
04:40:51.190 --> 04:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
competitive maps one party has won
 
04:40:53.990 --> 04:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
90 of the contests that's what they
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
define as competitive and mr speaker
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
finally to the argument of
 
04:41:01.270 --> 04:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
building districts around incumbents and
 
04:41:01.280 --> 04:41:02.868 align:start position:0%
building districts around incumbents and
candidates

04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
mr speaker that's a really interesting
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
way to go about it so every 10 years we
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
should build a district based on who's

committee re amendment 1736-h
 
04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%

04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
if i know that this proposal would keep
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
gail huff brown mark gilbane tim baxter
 
04:42:55.030 --> 04:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
and carolyn levitt
 
04:42:56.708 --> 04:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
four of the seven candidates currently
 
04:42:58.230 --> 04:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
fundraising and campaigning in the
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
republican primary for u.s congress in
 
04:43:01.910 --> 04:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
district one
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
within that district and not move them
 
04:43:06.070 --> 04:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
into district two
 
04:43:07.830 --> 04:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
and if i acknowledge that a candidate
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
does not need to live in the
 
04:43:10.708 --> 04:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
congressional district in which he is a
 
04:43:12.788 --> 04:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
candidate but i know that the last time
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire candidate for congress
 
04:43:16.390 --> 04:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
lived outside of the district in which
 
04:43:18.550 --> 04:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
he was running he gathered less than two
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
percent of the total votes
 
04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this amendment as
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
opposed to the majority's proposal would
 
04:43:28.230 --> 04:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
move just one town not 86 towns between
 
04:43:28.240 --> 04:43:29.350 align:start position:0%
move just one town not 86 towns between

districts
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
would move 9 000 people not five hundred
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
and fifty nine thousand people from one
 
04:43:36.310 --> 04:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
district to the other
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
and would move less than one percent of
 
04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
the population not forty one percent of
 
04:43:43.110 --> 04:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
the population from one district to the
 
04:43:43.120 --> 04:43:44.150 align:start position:0%
the population from one district to the

04:43:46.550 --> 04:43:46.560 align:start position:0%

of transportation
 
04:51:43.830 --> 04:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
if i believe decisions on spending money
 
04:51:45.910 --> 04:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
state money belong in this room not a
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
room on hazen drive
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that a similar
 
04:51:50.868 --> 04:51:50.878 align:start position:0%
language is already attached to the
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
04:51:55.510 --> 04:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
finally mr speaker
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
if i know bill this came out of
 
04:51:58.708 --> 04:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
transportation committee without
 
04:52:00.868 --> 04:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
recommendation which is proof that this
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
bill belongs on the table would i now
 
04:52:05.110 --> 04:52:05.120 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues if i believe that given the
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
current state of the electric vehicle
 
04:52:19.440 --> 04:52:21.110 align:start position:0%

industry

04:52:21.110 --> 04:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
industry
 
04:52:23.350 --> 04:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
is so frequently changing and that is
 
04:52:24.868 --> 04:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
both timely
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
and in my mind vital that we hear the
 
04:52:30.070 --> 04:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
debate on this bill
 
04:52:32.948 --> 04:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that the fair exchange
 
04:52:35.110 --> 04:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
of competing ideas
 
04:52:38.310 --> 04:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
is the foundational bedrock of our
 
04:52:38.320 --> 04:52:39.750 align:start position:0%
is the foundational bedrock of our
democracy

04:52:39.750 --> 04:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
and that for more than two years this
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
house through various
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
valid reasons has not been able to hear
 
04:52:48.550 --> 04:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
and debate the important questions
 
04:52:50.708 --> 04:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
before us
 
04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
questions that our constituents have
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
asked us to discuss and debate
 
04:52:57.750 --> 04:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
and finally if i believe that this trend
 
04:52:59.510 --> 04:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
of tabling more
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
and more
 
04:53:03.750 --> 04:53:03.760 align:start position:0%

04:53:15.510 --> 04:53:15.520 align:start position:0%

04:53:21.190 --> 04:53:21.200 align:start position:0%

if the bill passes as is local
 
04:59:02.070 --> 04:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
communities will be unable to address
 
04:59:05.270 --> 04:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
the concerns of nearby residents without
 
04:59:07.430 --> 04:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
deploying the police in the early
 
04:59:10.150 --> 04:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
morning hours until 4 00 a.m
 
04:59:12.230 --> 04:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
in communities where the facilities are
 
04:59:14.708 --> 04:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
next to municipal parking lots as also
 
04:59:16.628 --> 04:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
is the case in lebanon
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
winter winter snow removal will be very
 
04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
difficult without towing the customers
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
here's the um
 
04:59:27.510 --> 04:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
the minority amendment simply confirms
 
04:59:29.670 --> 04:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
the right of local communities to
 
04:59:32.310 --> 04:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
regulate expanded hours of operations to
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
fit local circumstances
 
04:59:37.510 --> 04:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
it only affects the establishment the
 
04:59:40.550 --> 04:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
poker palace if the local governing body
 
04:59:42.868 --> 04:59:42.878 align:start position:0%
decides that expanding beyond the
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
current hours harms the municipality's
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
ability to provide expected municipal
 
04:59:48.718 --> 04:59:49.990 align:start position:0%
ability to provide expected municipal
services

04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
it brings back the limited right long
 
04:59:55.430 --> 04:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
granted to the municipalities to set
 
04:59:59.110 --> 04:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable hours of operation and mr
 
05:00:02.230 --> 05:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
speaker i'd like to request a division
 
05:00:03.750 --> 05:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:00:08.470 --> 05:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:10.230 --> 05:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you mr
 
05:00:10.240 --> 05:00:11.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker thank you mr
speaker

05:00:11.750 --> 05:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
05:00:13.830 --> 05:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
first for the record there is no such
 
05:00:16.230 --> 05:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
thing in our statutes that defines a
 
05:00:17.910 --> 05:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
poker palace
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
these are charitable gaming locations
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
that are supported by our charities over
 
05:00:25.510 --> 05:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
500 they're going to be increasing
 
05:00:26.550 --> 05:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
because of some of the other things we
 
05:00:28.868 --> 05:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
did earlier this year
 
05:00:28.878 --> 05:00:30.390 align:start position:0%
did earlier this year
so

05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
this is an interesting situation where
 
05:00:35.270 --> 05:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
the majority report was ought to pass
 
05:00:36.868 --> 05:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
and the minority report was ought to
 
05:00:36.878 --> 05:00:37.910 align:start position:0%
and the minority report was ought to
pass

05:00:37.910 --> 05:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:00:39.750 --> 05:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
with amendment we don't see this very
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
often so the way the procedure is we
 
05:00:44.150 --> 05:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
have to go through the amendment
 
05:00:46.470 --> 05:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
first so that's what we're doing and the
 
05:00:49.110 --> 05:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces the whole bill
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to briefly talk about the
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
bill and the bill is only three lines
 
05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
long so i won't be very long
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
on this
 
05:00:55.680 --> 05:00:57.750 align:start position:0%
on this
so

05:00:57.750 --> 05:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
it is about the hours of operation of
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
our charitable gaming locations
 
05:01:01.600 --> 05:01:02.550 align:start position:0%
our charitable gaming locations
currently

05:01:02.550 --> 05:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:01:04.868 --> 05:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
these locations may the
 
05:01:08.230 --> 05:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
word is may may be open from 11 am in
 
05:01:13.350 --> 05:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
the morning to 1pm 1am at night
 
05:01:15.510 --> 05:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
the bill just changes that from 8am in
 
05:01:16.470 --> 05:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
the morning
 
05:01:16.480 --> 05:01:17.190 align:start position:0%
the morning
to

05:01:17.190 --> 05:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:01:19.270 --> 05:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
4am at night
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay it adds six hours
 
05:01:22.320 --> 05:01:24.230 align:start position:0%
okay it adds six hours
so

05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
we discuss four things in the committee
 
05:01:29.750 --> 05:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
why why do we want to expand the hours
 
05:01:31.590 --> 05:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
while we heard testimony about hampton
 
05:01:34.550 --> 05:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
beach during that during high season
 
05:01:36.628 --> 05:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
if it's a rainy day we have we have a we
 
05:01:38.788 --> 05:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
have a charitable location at hampton
 
05:01:40.550 --> 05:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
beach right across from the ocean they
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
were saying hey we'd like to open
 
05:01:45.990 --> 05:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
earlier and you know in that logic this
 
05:01:47.670 --> 05:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
conway has a location as well matter of
 
05:01:49.590 --> 05:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
fact there are 16 locations in the state
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
05:01:53.270 --> 05:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
that are charitable gaming locations not
 
05:01:55.270 --> 05:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
poker policies
 
05:01:55.280 --> 05:01:56.470 align:start position:0%
poker policies
so

05:01:56.470 --> 05:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
so we like our tourists and we like them
 
05:02:00.788 --> 05:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
to help contribute to the charities as
 
05:02:02.550 --> 05:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
well as to the education trust fund
 
05:02:06.310 --> 05:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
because that's where the monies go
 
05:02:06.320 --> 05:02:07.510 align:start position:0%
because that's where the monies go
we

05:02:07.510 --> 05:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
rep my friend from
 
05:02:12.310 --> 05:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
lebanon mentioned the liquor we did talk
 
05:02:14.470 --> 05:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
to liquor about this yes they're open
 
05:02:16.868 --> 05:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
they they allow pouring of liquor from
 
05:02:16.878 --> 05:02:18.550 align:start position:0%
they they allow pouring of liquor from
from

05:02:18.550 --> 05:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:02:19.990 --> 05:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
8 a.m
 
05:02:23.830 --> 05:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
right now 8 a.m to 1 p.m or 1 a.m in the
 
05:02:23.840 --> 05:02:25.750 align:start position:0%
right now 8 a.m to 1 p.m or 1 a.m in the
morning

05:02:25.750 --> 05:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
morning
 
05:02:26.948 --> 05:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
so the other thing we just the other
 
05:02:28.230 --> 05:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
things we discussed is that we really
 
05:02:29.430 --> 05:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:02:31.030 --> 05:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
do the six hours do we want to do four
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
hours we want to add two uh three hours
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh but we we wound up saying now we want
 
05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
to we want to we want to add the
 
05:02:40.470 --> 05:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
additional six hours then there was
 
05:02:45.030 --> 05:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:46.550 --> 05:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
when this came up
 
05:02:46.560 --> 05:02:47.350 align:start position:0%
when this came up
we

05:02:47.350 --> 05:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:02:48.868 --> 05:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
the executive director of lottery who's
 
05:02:50.470 --> 05:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
also a lawyer
 
05:02:52.948 --> 05:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
said municipalities already have the
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
authority to restrict
 
05:02:56.470 --> 05:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
and the example that we use all the time
 
05:02:58.550 --> 05:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
is salem where they restrict the
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
locations within salem where you can
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
open a charitable gaming location
 
05:03:03.600 --> 05:03:08.628 align:start position:0%
open a charitable gaming location
so

05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:10.150 --> 05:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
we had all these discussions then we had
 
05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
the uh we decided there was going to be
 
05:03:14.070 --> 05:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
three amendments i i moved one amendment
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
i didn't move it i i came prepared with
 
05:03:16.000 --> 05:03:17.030 align:start position:0%
i didn't move it i i came prepared with
it

05:03:17.030 --> 05:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:03:18.390 --> 05:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
where we would restrict the time a
 
05:03:19.830 --> 05:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
05:03:21.990 --> 05:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
i but i realized very quickly that i
 
05:03:23.350 --> 05:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have the votes so i didn't move
 
05:03:25.670 --> 05:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment in the exec session there
 
05:03:27.590 --> 05:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
was a second one that wasn't moved and
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
then there was this amendment that we're
 
05:03:30.948 --> 05:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
talking about right now
 
05:03:32.390 --> 05:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
that was moved
 
05:03:34.550 --> 05:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
but the committee voted this amendment
 
05:03:34.560 --> 05:03:36.070 align:start position:0%
but the committee voted this amendment
down

05:03:36.070 --> 05:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:03:36.080 --> 05:03:37.670 align:start position:0%
down
and

05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:39.990 --> 05:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we basically the conclusion was that
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
the municipalities already have the
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
authority to do these things that the
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative from lebanon is talking
 
05:03:44.480 --> 05:03:45.510 align:start position:0%
representative from lebanon is talking
about

05:03:45.510 --> 05:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:03:45.520 --> 05:03:46.708 align:start position:0%
about
and

05:03:46.708 --> 05:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:46.718 --> 05:03:48.708 align:start position:0%
and
we

05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
and that we felt it wasn't needed to be
 
05:03:52.390 --> 05:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
this type of thing wasn't needed to be
 
05:03:55.430 --> 05:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
in our charitable gaming statutes
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
so with that i hope you all push the uh
 
05:04:00.150 --> 05:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
red button to vote down this
 
05:04:00.160 --> 05:04:01.190 align:start position:0%
red button to vote down this
amendment

05:04:01.190 --> 05:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:04:02.628 --> 05:04:02.638 align:start position:0%
and then we could quickly go to a voice
 
05:04:04.868 --> 05:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
vote because both sides actually agree
 
05:04:10.150 --> 05:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:12.708 --> 05:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the minority
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
amendment 1627h
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
05:05:14.628 --> 05:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:16.948 --> 05:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
the motion before us
 
05:05:21.190 --> 05:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
is the minority amendment 1627h
 
05:05:24.230 --> 05:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote
 
05:05:26.150 --> 05:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative almi for
 
05:05:32.550 --> 05:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:35.110 --> 05:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker

tax simplicity is a good tax policy

the competitive goal of good tax policy
 
05:11:28.628 --> 05:11:28.638 align:start position:0%
should be implemented where possible
 
05:11:31.030 --> 05:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
because of this state's heavy reliance
 
05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
on these business taxes
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%

potential impact a particular change may
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%

05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:12:03.830 --> 05:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
and two of our own house representatives

representing coast six
 
05:12:12.788 --> 05:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
every tax law passed by this legislature
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
will in some way change our competitive
 
05:12:18.868 --> 05:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
position with neighboring states
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
the tax commission pointed out when they
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
stated in their introduction
 
05:12:26.070 --> 05:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
we took into account ways to ensure
 
05:12:28.788 --> 05:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
fairness and equity in the allocation of
 
05:12:32.390 --> 05:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
business taxes among similarly situated
 
05:12:32.400 --> 05:12:33.510 align:start position:0%
business taxes among similarly situated
businesses

05:12:33.510 --> 05:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:12:36.070 --> 05:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
entities and taxpayers
 
05:12:37.510 --> 05:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
ensure clear
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
tax laws and synchronization that
 
05:12:42.628 --> 05:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
enhances the growth of jobs
 
05:12:45.510 --> 05:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
and income in the state
 
05:12:47.670 --> 05:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
our recommendations therefore take into
 
05:12:49.350 --> 05:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
account the potential impact a
 
05:12:51.030 --> 05:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
particular change may have on the
 
05:12:53.750 --> 05:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
state's revenues this bill which we are
 
05:12:55.190 --> 05:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
pondering now
 
05:12:58.868 --> 05:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
senate bill 435 fn is such a bill
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
one section which i am not against is
 
05:13:03.910 --> 05:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
the change to single apportionment which
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
helps businesses that are required to
 
05:13:08.390 --> 05:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
apportion their income
 
05:13:10.708 --> 05:13:10.718 align:start position:0%
this is a good fix
 
05:13:13.590 --> 05:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
even though the dra showed in a static
 
05:13:13.600 --> 05:13:14.470 align:start position:0%
even though the dra showed in a static
study

05:13:14.470 --> 05:13:14.480 align:start position:0%

05:13:16.948 --> 05:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
using current law and the expected
 
05:13:19.670 --> 05:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
revenues to the state's general fund and
 
05:13:22.550 --> 05:13:22.560 align:start position:0%

05:13:32.470 --> 05:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
this means less tax revenue

is good for business
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
now to the second section which wishes
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
to modify the cap calculation on the

population of taxpayers who utilize net

05:13:55.590 --> 05:13:55.600 align:start position:0%

05:13:58.470 --> 05:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
of a negative perception of our business
 
05:14:01.510 --> 05:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
tax structure among small companies
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
considering location two or expanding in
 
05:14:08.628 --> 05:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire by changing our cap
 
05:14:12.628 --> 05:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
this proposed change in 435 of the cap
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
will have an adverse impact
 
05:14:16.628 --> 05:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
upon a number
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
of the 72 thousand plus small businesses
 
05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire who employ over three
 
05:14:25.350 --> 05:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand employees
 
05:14:27.910 --> 05:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
the present knolled cap is a hundred
 
05:14:27.920 --> 05:14:29.190 align:start position:0%
the present knolled cap is a hundred
percent

05:14:29.190 --> 05:14:29.200 align:start position:0%

05:14:32.470 --> 05:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
sb 435 wishes to change that
 
05:14:34.390 --> 05:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
to 80 percent
 
05:14:36.948 --> 05:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire encourages new startup
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%

05:14:40.000 --> 05:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
businesses and entrepreneurs to locate

05:14:41.030 --> 05:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
and supports the present small private
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
business employment environment
 
05:14:49.270 --> 05:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
but many of these small businesses
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
historically lose money in the first
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
years of operation
 
05:14:57.190 --> 05:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
or have a small margin of profitability
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
i am sure all of us in this chamber know
 
05:15:02.390 --> 05:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
of a small business in our towns that we
 
05:15:02.400 --> 05:15:03.750 align:start position:0%
of a small business in our towns that we
represent

05:15:03.750 --> 05:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:15:05.670 --> 05:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
and many of these
 
05:15:08.150 --> 05:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
businesses are just squeaking by to stay
 
05:15:09.430 --> 05:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
in business
 
05:15:12.230 --> 05:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
the 100 percent cap makes a difference
 
05:15:14.470 --> 05:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
of staying in business
 
05:15:16.708 --> 05:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
the present tax climate with a hundred
 
05:15:19.270 --> 05:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
percent net operating loss
 
05:15:21.990 --> 05:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
gives old and new new hampshire small
 
05:15:25.270 --> 05:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
businesses a chance to survive
 
05:15:27.750 --> 05:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
while the proposed 80 percent
 
05:15:31.350 --> 05:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
cap will make them pay part of that old
 
05:15:35.190 --> 05:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
100 percent in a bp tax effective
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
july 1st 2022
 
05:15:41.910 --> 05:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
and will limit their future cap of net
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
operating loss at eighty percent going
 
05:15:45.200 --> 05:15:46.708 align:start position:0%
operating loss at eighty percent going
forward

05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
this sudden change is not what startups
 
05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
or our community of small businesses
 
05:15:55.270 --> 05:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
are looking for in new hampshire
 
05:15:57.190 --> 05:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
they and all businesses want
 
05:15:57.200 --> 05:15:58.868 align:start position:0%
they and all businesses want
predictability

05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
predictability
 
05:16:01.510 --> 05:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
in their tax environment
 
05:16:03.990 --> 05:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
like you my fellow representatives i am
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
a strong supporter of small and big
 
05:16:08.230 --> 05:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
businesses in new hampshire
 
05:16:11.670 --> 05:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
we as a legislature have tried providing
 
05:16:14.470 --> 05:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
the optimum business tax climate here in
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:16:18.628 --> 05:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
because of our state's heavy reliance
 
05:16:21.190 --> 05:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
on business taxes
 
05:16:23.590 --> 05:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
there has been a lot of tax legislation
 
05:16:26.550 --> 05:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
enacted these last few years all under
 
05:16:29.350 --> 05:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
the heading to promote our new hampshire
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
tax advantage
 
05:16:33.510 --> 05:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
those issues that have been addressed
 
05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
and enacted include
 
05:16:38.070 --> 05:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
a decrease in business tax rates
 
05:16:40.868 --> 05:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing apportionment
 
05:16:42.948 --> 05:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
single sales factor
 
05:16:45.590 --> 05:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
and increasing filing thresholds
 
05:16:47.670 --> 05:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
and now another new hampshire tax
 
05:16:49.910 --> 05:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
advantage would be fixing the double
 
05:16:49.920 --> 05:16:51.190 align:start position:0%
advantage would be fixing the double
apportionment

05:16:51.190 --> 05:16:51.200 align:start position:0%

05:16:55.590 --> 05:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
issue under senate bill 435 fn
 
05:16:57.910 --> 05:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
but why now are we including an
 
05:16:57.920 --> 05:16:59.350 align:start position:0%
but why now are we including an
enactment

05:16:59.350 --> 05:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
enactment
 
05:17:00.628 --> 05:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
of an 80

05:19:29.430 --> 05:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
if we enact the 80 percent taxable
 
05:19:31.270 --> 05:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
income on the knolled
 
05:19:33.750 --> 05:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
net operating loss deduction the tax

2021
 
05:19:40.470 --> 05:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
supports the new hampshire tax
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
commission report of 2014 of which we
 
05:19:46.948 --> 05:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
still have two members serving in this
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
chamber that our knolled
 
05:19:51.910 --> 05:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
rules are some of the worst in the
 
05:19:51.920 --> 05:19:53.270 align:start position:0%
rules are some of the worst in the
nation

05:19:53.270 --> 05:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
nation
 
05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
so why are we making our nold rules
 
05:19:56.080 --> 05:19:57.110 align:start position:0%
so why are we making our nold rules
worse

05:19:57.110 --> 05:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
worse
 
05:19:58.948 --> 05:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
again i often hear
 
05:20:00.868 --> 05:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
that we rank low
 
05:20:02.948 --> 05:20:02.958 align:start position:0%
we are currently 41st in the tax
 
05:20:05.590 --> 05:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
foundation's business climate corporate
 
05:20:05.600 --> 05:20:06.788 align:start position:0%

taxes

05:20:06.788 --> 05:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
even with all our recent legislation to
 
05:20:09.600 --> 05:20:11.030 align:start position:0%
even with all our recent legislation to
improve

05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
improve
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
our ranking
 
05:20:15.590 --> 05:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
so why again are we enacting an 80
 
05:20:17.590 --> 05:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
percent cap
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
some in our state legislature often
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
speak ill
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
of the tax laws made in washington d.c
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
and so i ask
 
05:20:29.430 --> 05:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
why would we be agreeing with washington
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
d.c on an 80 percent cap
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
as this bill now stands new hampshire
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
would not only be keeping its
 
05:20:39.750 --> 05:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
restrictive 10-year net operating loss
 
05:20:39.760 --> 05:20:40.708 align:start position:0%
restrictive 10-year net operating loss
period

05:20:40.708 --> 05:20:40.718 align:start position:0%
period
 
05:20:43.030 --> 05:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
it would now be capping the utilization
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
of those net operating loss deductions
 
05:20:48.150 --> 05:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
to 80 percent taxable income
 
05:20:50.830 --> 05:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
making it more likely that some of those
 
05:20:53.830 --> 05:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
nolds will expire
 
05:20:53.840 --> 05:20:55.590 align:start position:0%
nolds will expire
unused

05:20:55.590 --> 05:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
unused
 
05:20:57.670 --> 05:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
that is a negative against the new
 
05:21:00.470 --> 05:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire tax advantage
 
05:21:03.030 --> 05:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
as a minority opposition on the house
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
ways and means committee
 
05:21:07.670 --> 05:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
i proposed orally that the solution to
 
05:21:10.548 --> 05:21:10.558 align:start position:0%
this sb 435
 
05:21:12.390 --> 05:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
to enhance the new hampshire tax
 
05:21:15.350 --> 05:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
advantage would be to decouple
 
05:21:18.628 --> 05:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
from the federal tax cap of 80 percent
 
05:21:21.830 --> 05:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
and remain at a hundred percent
 
05:21:24.310 --> 05:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
i also proposed orally an alternative
 
05:21:27.030 --> 05:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
solution for new hampshire businesses
 
05:21:29.190 --> 05:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
and that was to adopt both the federal
 
05:21:30.868 --> 05:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
80 percent cap
 
05:21:33.670 --> 05:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
and the federal indefinite carry forward
 
05:21:33.680 --> 05:21:35.110 align:start position:0%
and the federal indefinite carry forward
period

05:21:35.110 --> 05:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
period
 
05:21:37.270 --> 05:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
both were turned down
 
05:21:37.280 --> 05:21:38.628 align:start position:0%
both were turned down
and

05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:40.548 --> 05:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
i and then many of you who support
 
05:21:42.230 --> 05:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
business communities where you live and
 
05:21:42.240 --> 05:21:43.270 align:start position:0%

businesses by rejecting the present
 
05:21:50.708 --> 05:21:50.718 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
05:21:58.788 --> 05:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:02.868 --> 05:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
this bill is about three letter words
 
05:22:05.830 --> 05:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
f i x fix
 
05:22:07.990 --> 05:22:08.000 align:start position:0%

05:22:11.590 --> 05:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is not critical
 
05:22:14.470 --> 05:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
for passage this year

the fetal life protection act requiring

an ultrasound examination having
 
05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same with
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that the bill ought
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
to pass representative kurt welper for
 
05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:24:35.030 --> 05:24:35.040 align:start position:0%

all right this will be a division vote
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:37.670 --> 05:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:37.680 --> 05:25:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:25:52.310 --> 05:25:52.320 align:start position:0%

all right the house will come to order
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to table senate
 
05:26:09.590 --> 05:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
bill 399 representative osborne is
 
05:26:12.150 --> 05:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
recognized for parliamentary inquiry
 
05:26:13.990 --> 05:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that the
 
05:26:16.788 --> 05:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
language contained within sb 399 is a
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
less complete version of a position that
 
05:26:21.030 --> 05:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
was already taken by this house a few
 
05:26:23.590 --> 05:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
weeks ago past the other body on its way
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
to the governor's desk and if i know
 
05:26:28.548 --> 05:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
that passing this bill again or
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
less complete than the one already
 
05:26:31.350 --> 05:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
passed would just end up with a
 
05:26:32.708 --> 05:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
redundant bill that the governor will
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
have to veto and it's just a waste of
 
05:26:36.070 --> 05:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
our time right now would i press the
 
05:26:39.510 --> 05:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
green button to lay it on the table
 
05:26:41.110 --> 05:26:41.120 align:start position:0%

thank you very much mr speaker thank you
 
05:29:37.270 --> 05:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues i will be brief
 
05:29:39.190 --> 05:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
you may well wonder
 
05:29:41.590 --> 05:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
why we are pulling a 20 to nothing bill
 
05:29:44.230 --> 05:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
off consent but there really is a very
 
05:29:47.750 --> 05:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
good reason this bill is simply not as
 
05:29:50.470 --> 05:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
advertised and a rush to judgment on too
 
05:29:53.190 --> 05:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
many bills in too little time without
 
05:29:56.628 --> 05:29:56.638 align:start position:0%
due consideration led to this wholly
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
inappropriate vote count
 
05:29:58.958 --> 05:30:00.708 align:start position:0%
inappropriate vote count
first

05:30:00.708 --> 05:30:00.718 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:30:04.230 --> 05:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
sb 429 came to us as a part of a pair of
 
05:30:08.150 --> 05:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
bills both aimed at a complete overhaul
 
05:30:10.390 --> 05:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
if not the elimination of the site
 
05:30:12.788 --> 05:30:12.798 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
05:30:15.270 --> 05:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
that committee is one of the state's
 
05:30:18.868 --> 05:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
only institutions designed to provide
 
05:30:21.350 --> 05:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
public participation in energy decision
 
05:30:21.360 --> 05:30:22.390 align:start position:0%
public participation in energy decision
making

05:30:22.390 --> 05:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
making
 
05:30:25.110 --> 05:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
the partner bill was even titled quote
 
05:30:27.190 --> 05:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
05:30:30.150 --> 05:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
feasibility of replacing the site
 
05:30:32.150 --> 05:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
why you might ask were there two bills
 
05:30:36.948 --> 05:30:36.958 align:start position:0%
aimed at this same committee
 
05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
well that title tells you part of it
 
05:30:40.628 --> 05:30:40.638 align:start position:0%
it's a foregone conclusion they want to
 
05:30:42.788 --> 05:30:42.798 align:start position:0%
get rid of it because it stands in the
 
05:30:45.350 --> 05:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
way of fossil fuel expansion in this
 
05:30:45.360 --> 05:30:47.670 align:start position:0%
way of fossil fuel expansion in this
state

05:30:47.670 --> 05:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:30:50.070 --> 05:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
member will suspend
 
05:30:51.830 --> 05:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
as my good friend from walpole reminded
 
05:30:57.830 --> 05:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:31:01.270 --> 05:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
but our committee was told there was no
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
contradiction here between having two
 
05:31:05.110 --> 05:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
committees one setting up a committee to
 
05:31:07.110 --> 05:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
study and one that gives a detailed
 
05:31:09.190 --> 05:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
program of reforms
 
05:31:10.628 --> 05:31:10.638 align:start position:0%
it was a little bit like the magician
 
05:31:12.390 --> 05:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
waving his hand and saying watch over
 
05:31:13.750 --> 05:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
here we're looking at a permanent
 
05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
solution while they
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
brought forward another one which had
 
05:31:19.750 --> 05:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
the reforms that the committee might
 
05:31:21.430 --> 05:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
have come up with
 
05:31:23.670 --> 05:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
belatedly we recognize this bill as
 
05:31:26.230 --> 05:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
needing a good hard second look because
 
05:31:28.948 --> 05:31:28.958 align:start position:0%
just maybe it's this bill that has
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
buried in it the outlines of the
 
05:31:32.868 --> 05:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
permanent solution
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
this lower amendment focuses on two fees
 
05:31:38.628 --> 05:31:38.638 align:start position:0%
that are part of the fates the fee
 
05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
structure the first is for wind
 
05:31:44.548 --> 05:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
this particular one thousand dollar per
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
megawatt rate came out of one
 
05:31:47.760 --> 05:31:49.830 align:start position:0%
megawatt rate came out of one
wind

05:31:49.830 --> 05:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
wind
 
05:31:52.788 --> 05:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
controversy a very controversial
 
05:31:54.628 --> 05:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
facility for
 
05:31:56.390 --> 05:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
almost 10 years ago
 
05:31:58.868 --> 05:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
because of that one anomaly
 
05:32:00.670 --> 05:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
wind was stuck with this
 
05:32:03.670 --> 05:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
disproportionate fee rate structure
 
05:32:07.350 --> 05:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
so that a 1 000 megawatt wind facility
 
05:32:09.030 --> 05:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
would be charged
 
05:32:11.670 --> 05:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
2 million dollars under the new fee
 
05:32:11.680 --> 05:32:13.030 align:start position:0%
2 million dollars under the new fee
schedule

05:32:13.030 --> 05:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
05:32:16.230 --> 05:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
where an equivalent 1 000 megawatt
 
05:32:18.390 --> 05:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas facility
 
05:32:19.830 --> 05:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
would be charged
 
05:32:22.310 --> 05:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
a hundred and twenty thousand dollars or
 
05:32:24.150 --> 05:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
a coal or an oil
 
05:32:26.788 --> 05:32:26.798 align:start position:0%
ninety thousand dollars
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand dollars two million
 
05:32:32.708 --> 05:32:32.718 align:start position:0%
dollars a megawatt my friends as my
 
05:32:35.350 --> 05:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
chair has told me is a megawatt no
 
05:32:37.750 --> 05:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
matter where the electron comes from
 
05:32:39.750 --> 05:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
in fact this bill
 
05:32:42.548 --> 05:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
this so-called interim measure is
 
05:32:46.708 --> 05:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
targeting renewable energy facility
 
05:32:49.670 --> 05:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
and generation in this state
 
05:32:56.548 --> 05:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:57.430 --> 05:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:32:59.590 --> 05:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
second part there are two fees as you
 
05:33:01.750 --> 05:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
can see from the floor amendment the one
 
05:33:03.350 --> 05:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
was for wind
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
bringing it down in line with the fossil
 
05:33:08.070 --> 05:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
fuel fee structure and the other is a
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
completely new category of fee which is
 
05:33:14.548 --> 05:33:14.558 align:start position:0%
to apply to renewable energy generation
 
05:33:17.590 --> 05:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
facilities across the board
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
solar energy storage green hydrogen
 
05:33:25.590 --> 05:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
geothermal whatever comes up
 
05:33:28.868 --> 05:33:28.878 align:start position:0%
and again at the twelve hundred dollar
 
05:33:31.750 --> 05:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
per megawatt rate which came out of an
 
05:33:34.310 --> 05:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
anomaly from basically ten years ago
 
05:33:36.390 --> 05:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
with one win facility
 
05:33:39.868 --> 05:33:39.878 align:start position:0%
no rationale whatsoever for
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
disproportionately charging renewable
 
05:33:44.708 --> 05:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
energy siting and compliance and
 
05:33:47.990 --> 05:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring at an outrageous rate while
 
05:33:51.510 --> 05:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels are being coddled
 
05:33:54.390 --> 05:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
why would this bill penalize the very
 
05:33:57.910 --> 05:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
resources our 10-year energy strategy
 
05:33:57.920 --> 05:33:59.830 align:start position:0%
resources our 10-year energy strategy
prioritizes

05:33:59.830 --> 05:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
prioritizes
 
05:34:03.070 --> 05:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
as the solution to our outdated
 
05:34:05.750 --> 05:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly fossil fuel-based energy
 
05:34:08.708 --> 05:34:08.718 align:start position:0%
system at a time when decarbonization is
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
the order of the day
 
05:34:13.350 --> 05:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
renewables provide us with resiliency
 
05:34:16.150 --> 05:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
fuel diversity increased savings and
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
security at the same time that they keep
 
05:34:22.390 --> 05:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
billions of energy dollars circulating
 
05:34:24.390 --> 05:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
in our new hampshire economy
 
05:34:27.190 --> 05:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
growing local businesses and jobs
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
in short
 
05:34:31.350 --> 05:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
as our ten-year energy shore strategy
 
05:34:35.350 --> 05:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
emphasizes we need to be instituting all
 
05:34:38.230 --> 05:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
measures possible to incentivize
 
05:34:41.030 --> 05:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and reduce greenhouse
 
05:34:44.548 --> 05:34:44.558 align:start position:0%
gas emissions across the board but this
 
05:34:47.190 --> 05:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
bill does the opposite making fossil
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
fuel development cheap and pricing
 
05:34:52.708 --> 05:34:52.718 align:start position:0%
renewables out of the market please
 
05:34:54.390 --> 05:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
support this amendment
 
05:34:56.390 --> 05:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
and correct the harmful policies
 
05:34:58.868 --> 05:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
embedded in this fee schedule
 
05:35:02.150 --> 05:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
and put the house on the record in
 
05:35:04.868 --> 05:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
support of the site evaluation committee
 
05:35:07.270 --> 05:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
and the clean energy transition
 
05:35:10.150 --> 05:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i ask you for a roll call vote
 
05:35:16.628 --> 05:35:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative vose is recognized to
 
05:35:22.150 --> 05:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:35:30.948 --> 05:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:32.708 --> 05:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
this house bill of this senate bill
 
05:35:36.788 --> 05:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
rather and another companion senate bill
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
were filed in direct
 
05:35:41.910 --> 05:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
response to recommendations made by a
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
state evaluation study committee
 
05:35:47.350 --> 05:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
that was formed
 
05:35:50.548 --> 05:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
as a result of the passage of hb2

last spring
 
05:35:55.030 --> 05:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee
 
05:35:57.990 --> 05:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
met several times during the fall
 
05:36:00.230 --> 05:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
i served on that committee and had
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
issued a report with several
 
05:36:02.160 --> 05:36:04.868 align:start position:0%
issued a report with several
recommendations

05:36:04.868 --> 05:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
05:36:07.030 --> 05:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
the bill that we're considering here
 
05:36:10.070 --> 05:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
eight senate bill 429 and another senate
 
05:36:12.628 --> 05:36:12.638 align:start position:0%
bill that we passed earlier
 
05:36:14.548 --> 05:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
implement recommendations from that
 
05:36:19.270 --> 05:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
the subject of this amendment which is
 
05:36:24.150 --> 05:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
the fee schedule that is contained
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
within this bill
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
which was revised by the amendment
 
05:36:31.030 --> 05:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
simply took
 
05:36:33.350 --> 05:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
the existing fee structure that's in
 
05:36:33.360 --> 05:36:34.788 align:start position:0%
the existing fee structure that's in
statute

05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:36:36.470 --> 05:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
and brought it up to date based on
 
05:36:36.480 --> 05:36:38.070 align:start position:0%
and brought it up to date based on
inflation

05:36:38.070 --> 05:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
05:36:40.548 --> 05:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
the original fees were put into statute
 
05:36:42.830 --> 05:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
statute back in
 
05:36:45.990 --> 05:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
2015. it was time to update those that
 
05:36:47.990 --> 05:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
fee schedule and that's what this bill
 
05:36:48.000 --> 05:36:49.670 align:start position:0%
fee schedule and that's what this bill
does

05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:36:53.110 --> 05:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
there was a new category added
 
05:36:55.430 --> 05:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
as my distinguished colleague mentioned
 
05:36:57.830 --> 05:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
a few minutes
 
05:37:00.150 --> 05:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
but the same rationale was used to
 
05:37:02.948 --> 05:37:02.958 align:start position:0%
calculate what the fees should be
 
05:37:05.990 --> 05:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
for that particular
 
05:37:07.830 --> 05:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
category of
 
05:37:12.788 --> 05:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:14.948 --> 05:37:14.958 align:start position:0%
all the rest of the
 
05:37:16.788 --> 05:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
portions of this
 
05:37:19.270 --> 05:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
rather extensive site evaluation
 
05:37:20.788 --> 05:37:20.798 align:start position:0%
committee bill
 
05:37:22.230 --> 05:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
were agreed on
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
by everyone
 
05:37:25.670 --> 05:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
on the science technology and energy
 
05:37:27.750 --> 05:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
committee it was a bipartisan 20 to
 
05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
nothing vote
 
05:37:31.670 --> 05:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
so i urge you
 
05:37:33.750 --> 05:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
to vote no on this amendment
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
so that can we can move forward
 
05:37:38.470 --> 05:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
with the important reforms that this
 
05:37:42.470 --> 05:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill contains thank you mr speaker
 
05:37:44.230 --> 05:37:44.240 align:start position:0%

excuse me request a roll call vote is
 
05:37:48.548 --> 05:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
that sufficiently seconded
 
05:37:50.310 --> 05:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
05:37:51.910 --> 05:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote members please take
 
05:38:12.548 --> 05:38:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:12.558 --> 05:38:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:38:43.830 --> 05:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:43.840 --> 05:39:02.548 align:start position:0%
 
here

05:39:02.548 --> 05:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:02.558 --> 05:39:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:39:09.270 --> 05:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:11.190 --> 05:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to adopt
 
05:39:14.470 --> 05:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
amendment 1896-h
 
05:39:17.030 --> 05:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
05:39:19.750 --> 05:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized to
 
05:39:21.670 --> 05:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh for a parliamentary inquiry
 
05:39:23.350 --> 05:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:39:26.070 --> 05:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you colleagues
 
05:39:28.548 --> 05:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
if i know that undercutting our own
 
05:39:31.350 --> 05:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
support for renewable energy projects as
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
stated in our state 10-year energy
 
05:39:35.030 --> 05:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
strategy report
 
05:39:38.708 --> 05:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
is a short-sighted and costly course
 
05:39:41.110 --> 05:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
and if i know that sp
 
05:39:44.070 --> 05:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
429 without this amendment
 
05:39:46.708 --> 05:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
sets an arbitrarily high per megawatt
 
05:39:46.718 --> 05:39:48.150 align:start position:0%
sets an arbitrarily high per megawatt
cost

05:39:48.150 --> 05:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:39:51.190 --> 05:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
on clean renewable energy projects
 
05:39:53.030 --> 05:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
10 times the fee
 
05:39:55.910 --> 05:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
rate for gas projects
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
which also runs counter to that strategy
 
05:40:01.750 --> 05:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know
 
05:40:04.230 --> 05:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
that to help new hampshire
 
05:40:06.708 --> 05:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
pursue energy independence
 
05:40:08.868 --> 05:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
true market competition
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
and the lowered costs and emissions that
 
05:40:14.868 --> 05:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
come from portfolio diversity
 
05:40:17.110 --> 05:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
then would i now push the green button
 
05:40:19.270 --> 05:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
to bring the fee schedule in line with
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's energy goals thank you
 
05:40:25.350 --> 05:40:25.360 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker mr speaker if i

that is contained in senate bill 429
 
05:40:40.150 --> 05:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
simply brings those fees
 
05:40:41.670 --> 05:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
in line
 
05:40:44.788 --> 05:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
with what inflation has done to
 
05:40:47.590 --> 05:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
our dollars since 2015 when those fees
 
05:40:49.990 --> 05:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
were originally set
 
05:40:52.628 --> 05:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
and if i know that there are substantial
 
05:40:54.470 --> 05:40:54.480 align:start position:0%

know how long we're supposed to wait on
 
05:43:03.990 --> 05:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
these and i have done it to the other
 
05:43:05.750 --> 05:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
party too and i'm not going to argue
 
05:43:14.788 --> 05:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%

05:43:28.390 --> 05:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
what reason does a member rise um i
 
05:43:30.628 --> 05:43:30.638 align:start position:0%

i don't know the set number of seconds
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
before pounding the gavel but obviously
 
05:43:38.948 --> 05:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
you have to wait at least a certain
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
amount of time for us to uh
 
05:43:43.110 --> 05:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know get our elderly knees working
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%

not going to go through it all but
 
05:47:50.868 --> 05:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
there's another another section that we
 
05:47:54.510 --> 05:47:54.520 align:start position:0%

287-e colon 9 roman 4.
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%

05:48:04.708 --> 05:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
and modernization bill
 
05:48:05.830 --> 05:48:05.840 align:start position:0%

after the vote was taken in the
committee

05:48:07.110 --> 05:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:48:09.270 --> 05:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
it came to our attention that this
 
05:48:10.868 --> 05:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
change was also needed in another
 
05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
section of the law
 
05:48:12.958 --> 05:48:13.990 align:start position:0%
section of the law
