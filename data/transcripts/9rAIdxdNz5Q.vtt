and hopkington today I'm I'm honored to

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
the work of the SB 251 study committee
 
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
um this is a committee that had passed
 
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
last year uh and we have been meeting in
 
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
Earnest um and I want to thank
 
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
representative re for all her hard work
 
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start position:0%
on the committee um this was a
 
00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Bill to take a look at what
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
is going on in our parole system um it's
 
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
one of the most productive committees
 
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
that I have been lucky to be a part of
 
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
um but what we realized is that the
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
issues are complex and that they require
 
00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
some additional study we did produce a
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive report um which I
 
00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't have with me but I'm
 
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
happy to send to the committee members
 
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
afterwards and we were just very lucky
 
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
to have have a lot of folks who came to
 
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
speak to us um from all sectors from law
 
00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement to folks that have
 
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
experience parole to the parole board
 
00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 align:start position:0%
folks um mental health folks the
 
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
Corrections and the systemic issues that
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
were raised were complex and you know I
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
think we really just started to scratch
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
the surface on what's going on um just a
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
a sort of as background um the council
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
for state government uh has been doing a
 
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
lot of work collaboratively in New
 
00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to look at why we have sort of
 
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
a higher rate of folks in our our
 
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
Correctional settings that are on that
 
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 align:start position:0%
are there because of parole violations
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
it just we're just higher than the
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
national average and so the counties and
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
now the state have been engaging in
 
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
incredible work the Department of
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
Corrections commissioner has really been
 
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
at the Forefront of this to sort of
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
figure out why I would say that one of
 
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
the and representative Reed you know can
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
add to this one of the biggest issues we
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
identified as you know that adds to the
 
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
complexity of of course the entire
 
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
correctional system but the Pearl system
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
as well is that our correctional system
 
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
has become the place where we are
 
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 align:start position:0%
treating the mental health and substance
 
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
misuse crisis we are spending Millions
 
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
upon millions of dollars to treat folks
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
in Correctional settings um and that's
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
complex uh and it's expensive and so um
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
and the PE system is just a piece of
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
that um so that is uh a part of the
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
puzzle that we continue to want to work
 
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
on um we also thought it was important
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
to continue this work because the
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
council for state government has been
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
working with the governor's commission
 
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
advisory Commission on mental illness in
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
the correction system but it's the
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
governor's commission and the committee
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
members felt like we needed to continue
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
that legislative oversight of this work
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
in Partnership and that was also a
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion of the Department of
 
00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
Corrections to continue that leg
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
legislative involvement so essentially
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is just keep the
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
committee alive requires an additional
 
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
report and then repeals it um it was
 
00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
important because the last bill did not
 
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
have a repeal it was sort of unclear um
 
00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
it is nice to have an end date on these
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
things so it just extends it one more
 
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
year I'm happy to take any questions um
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh and representative Reed can also sort
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
of speak to the effectiveness of the
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
committee thank you so much for your
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
consideration any
 
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.790 align:start position:0%
consideration any
questions

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
just a comment um we worked uh it was an
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
all summer um you know uh committee and
 
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
Jonah was on it as well and that was the
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
Prime driver of our problems faced is
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
the mental health and substance abuse so
 
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
I agree you
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
know see you no further questions thank
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%

11 um I come to you today with SB 418 it
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
was a change from my original
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
bill um and we'll stay away from that
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
the original one I did want to test for
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
THC limits because we're having a lot of
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
driving problems um people are aware
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
that it's very hard to test for THC we
 
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
have to bring Specialists um but that's
 
00:30:45.389 --> 00:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
a bill for next year um I spoke to
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner Edwards and we amended this
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
bill and now it is um about increasing
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
the length of suspension for refusing
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
chemical tests of um intoxication when
 
00:30:57.149 --> 00:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
arrested for violation of New Hampshire
 
00:30:57.159 --> 00:30:58.470 align:start position:0%
arrested for violation of New Hampshire
driving

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
driving
 
00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
uh the bill is amended gives the judge
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
discretion to suspend the entire
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory 17-day incar incarceration
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
period in favor of substance abuse
 
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
evaluation in compliance with the
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
treatment plan when someone is charged
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
with aggravated DUI having a blood
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol content of16 or more uh the
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders again with the Department
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
of Safety the New Hampshire forensic lab
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire Association of
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
police according to the attorney for the
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety seven of every 10
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
people arrested for DUI in New Hampshire
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
refus a chemical test it's
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
unacceptable according to data from the
 
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety 127 people were
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
killed as a result of crashes in 23 even
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
more were killed in 22 about 150 and
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
2third of all the crashes that resulted
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
in deaths were alcohol and or drug
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
related so we must continue to be
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
proactive in New Hampshire to keep our
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
state one of the same safest in the
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
nation on the roads and this includes
 
00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:02.919 align:start position:0%
protecting drivers on the roads and
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
pedestrians on our sidewalk um for me
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
personally um since I've been young if
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
I'd go out especially now if I have a
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
drink I'm very aware that I should not
 
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
have that second
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
drink and I think it and I probably have
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
not had an extra drink many times for
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
the last 40 years because I'm aware of
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
punishment so I see this as a very good
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
deterrent effect um I think uh assistant
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner Edwards will have more
 
00:32:37.149 --> 00:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
statistics and data on deterrence
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
effects and that's about where I am on
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
the bill but again I thank you for
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
having me this morning and I wish you
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
all a Happy
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
Easter thank you any questions for the
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
senator seeing none thank you hold on
 
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
one one question yes
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question um thanks I'm just
 
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:58.509 align:start position:0%
taking my question um thanks I'm just
wondering

00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
how does this um interact with like
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
pleading the fifth do you know what I
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
mean like is by taking a test kind of
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
like forcing someone to well I I mean I
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
think the commissioner
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
will say again what I'm about to say
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
that um the law in New Hampshire is if
 
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
you refuse you're it's an admission of
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
guilt so yes you are you don't have to
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
take the test then you're going to get
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
the consequences that's the laws we've
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
had on the books for long as I can
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
remember thank you and just for
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
clarification the Fifth Amendment
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply necessarily unless you
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
were in custody and also where this is a
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
privilege to drive not a right so it
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
gets there's a there's a Nuance in that
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.310 align:start position:0%
 
who's

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
who's
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
Moses I can just add to that it's called
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
implied consent yeah which is what you
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
give when you get a driver's license
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
it's implied consent that you'll take
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
difference good
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
committee um appreciate the opportunity
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
here um I'm here uh in behalf of the New
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire criminal defense lawyers
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm here to testify in
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
opposition to the proposed amended
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill with regard to increased penalties
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:34:44.589 --> 00:34:44.599 align:start position:0%
ALS um I'm not going to have any real
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
comments to make about the changes in
 
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
the aggravated DWI law um but more so
 
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
the more so the Al and in the uh four or
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
five minutes that I'm allotted subject
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
to questioning uh I just have um three
 
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
points I want to make if I if I may the
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
first is that the increase in the uh
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
penalty for refusing to submit to a
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
chemical test is um very very close to
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
something which would have a Draconian
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
effect on many citizens in New
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um there are my understanding
 
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
is there are
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
approximately 9 to 10,000 DWI cases per
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
year uh my practice which is located in
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
Amherst New Hampshire predominantly
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
deals with these situations and I've
 
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
been doing it as you can probably tell
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
by my less than youthful appearance for
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
years um representative Manion and I
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
have done some business in the past when
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
he prosecuted for the pelm
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
PD um and so he knows that I've been
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
around for a while the the problem is
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
that the a first offender particularly
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
somebody with no prior record of any
 
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
kind or any history um of alcohol um
 
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
offenses or
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
interaction when they have their license
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
taken away for a year uh that has
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
tremendous collateral damage potential
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
people lose jobs jobs are lost families
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
can't be
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
supported um
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
and houses are lost to foreclosure in a
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
time when we're all having some economic
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
difficulties as it is and and what's
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
worse is that even if the
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
individual um is ultimately exonerated
 
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.230 align:start position:0%
individual um is ultimately exonerated
in

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
court um it has currently has no impact
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
on the ALS punishment so that someone um
 
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
could be and I've seen it many times
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
someone could be arrested for DWI it
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
really is not a case where the person is
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
impaired not with standing the Judgment
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
made by often somewhat youthful police
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
officers uh on the street and yet um
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
even after a an acquit or a dismissal or
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
in some cases prosecutors who realize
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
that the case really needs to be dropped
 
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
because the evidence is simply not there
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
the person is still stuck with right now
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
six months and the proposal is for a
 
00:37:26.309 --> 00:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
year the uh enhanced ALS which goes to
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
now three years
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
um potentially is is actually consistent
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
with the penalty for second offense DWI
 
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
which is a three-year loss a license so
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
essentially someone who has uh refused
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
to submit to Chemical Testing and then
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
and is acquitted or the charges are even
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
dropped uh and who was subsequently
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
arrested and refuses again is subject to
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
a three-year loss of license um that
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of situation um despite the
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
intent of the statute which is to uh
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat quickly remove people from the
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
road uh sometimes a uh this bill would
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
have uh people removed from the road for
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
far longer than their conduct justifies
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
which brings me to the second uh point
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
of opposition and that is that the ALS
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
law as currently on the books and even
 
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
under the proposed
 
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
amendment does not like in many states
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
characterize the ALS process as one
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
which is civil in nature rather than
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
criminal the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:40.790 align:start position:0%
criminal the New Hampshire Supreme Court
in

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
1997 uh determined that it was a civil
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
process and therefore uh not bound by
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
certain constitutional constrictions
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
either under the state or federal
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
constitutions and yet they've also
 
00:38:56.599 --> 00:38:58.109 align:start position:0%
constitutions and yet they've also
decided

00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
decided
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh that even though the privilege to
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
drive privilege to have a license to
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
drive is subject to a hearings process
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
which has been clearly defined by the
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court as one which
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
is uh requires due process due process
 
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
meaning fundamental fairness now
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
when when we look at this proposed
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
amendment it needs to be looked at from
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
the standpoint of whether or not it is
 
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.630 align:start position:0%
the standpoint of whether or not it is
remediate

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
remediate
 
00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.829 align:start position:0%
remediate
or

00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
punitive and why does it make a
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
difference well it makes a difference
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
because when one looks at the intent of
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
the statute of the process the ALS
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
process the intent is to quickly remove
 
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
presumably inebriated drivers from the
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
road but at the same time the effect of
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
it can become so punitive that it
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
crosses the line between a civil
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
sanction and criminal
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
punishment and this is one of and it's
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
very difficult to determine where that
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
line is drawn the statute as proposed to
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
be amended in our view is going to cross
 
00:40:17.109 --> 00:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
that line because uh even if the use of
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
the phrase civil proceeding is accepted
 
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
and of course the courts do give
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
significant difference to legislative
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
bodies uh when it comes to to um
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
statutory construction and so if a
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
statute were to say this is intended to
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
be a a civil sanction courts will
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
typically defer to that our statute as
 
00:40:41.309 --> 00:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
currently enacted as well as the
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment is silent on whether
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
or not it's civil or or
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
criminal only the Supreme Court uh
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
holding has what determined it's it's uh
 
00:40:58.109 --> 00:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
civil now even if the intent is written
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
in as being civil the ultimate
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
punishment may be so
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
punitive that it transforms that civil
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
context to one of a a criminal
 
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh penalty if you will a criminal
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
punishment and that's what this bill
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
will do if it's passed as amended
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
because the sanction is so severe that
 
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh it cannot be said that it doesn't
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
violate the eth Amendment to the United
 
00:41:29.069 --> 00:41:29.079 align:start position:0%
States Constitution
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I would only like and I will close
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
subject to whatever whatever questions
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
the committee may have if this bill is
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
amended and by the way um I I digress
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
just a bit we have a whole lot of people
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who have commercial
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
driver licenses a lot um I I dare say
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
that in my practice probably 30 to 35%
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
of the people I represent and that's a a
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
lot of people um I probably have 250
 
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
pending cases right now and many many of
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
them hold CDLs the ALS form that's
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
currently in effect um makes no
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
provision whatsoever as do almost every
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
other state to advise a CDL holder as to
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
the consequences of his
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
refusal and that in our view uh needs to
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
be changed now if it turns out and it it
 
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
won't be resolved until un L than until
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed whether or not it's
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to require the intervention of a
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
court to determine whether or not uh the
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
new sanctions under the amended Bill are
 
00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
criminal or civil uh if it should be
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
resolved by a particularly an appell
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
court that it is a criminal uh sanction
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
then the Bureau of hearings who I
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
understand is here with the
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative attorney CCO a a good
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
friend and colleague whom I respect
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
greatly um they're going to completely
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
be out of business because the
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
administrative agency cannot sanction
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
people with criminal penalties and
 
00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:14.559 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that may occur
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh and may not have been foreseen when
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
this process was undertaken to amend the
 
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
statute so I would respectfully submit
 
00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:26.559 align:start position:0%
that the ALS form with its fine print on
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
the back side side that almost nobody
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
even some lawyers don't understand needs
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
to be far more clear and needs to spell
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
out um much more what the potential
 
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
penalties and sanctions are going to be
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
so that a person can make an informed
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
consent which our Supreme Court has also
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
said an individual has a right to do is
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
to make an informed and intelligent
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
decision particularly since they're not
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
entitled to the right to counsel and
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
this comes around from uh from the point
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
I earlier made
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
that if it it's determined by a court
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
which we believe there is a strong
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
probability will occur if this amended
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
bill with its somewhat honorous
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
sanctions is passed um what has been the
 
00:44:14.589 --> 00:44:14.599 align:start position:0%
law n since 1986 whereby people do not
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
have the right to counsel when they're M
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
making a decision about whether it ATT
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
test or not if that turns out to be a a
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
a legal rule that it is Criminal then
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
they are going to have a right the
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
council because this is as our Supreme
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
Court has said it is a due process
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
matter which requires fundamental
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
fairness and so um I would respectfully
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
submit that much more is needed to put
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
people on notice uh of of what what
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
their choices are what these sanctions
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
will be but this bill um this bill will
 
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
do nothing to help that unless along the
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
way the department of safety is is
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
tasked with the uh with the obligation
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
to prepare a clear and understandable uh
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
document which people who are being
 
00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:07.559 align:start position:0%
asked to submit to chemical tests
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
um understand lastly it's been
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
established over the years that changing
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
the penalties for refusing have has not
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
increased the the likelihood that people
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
are going to take the tests I can tell
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
you based on my own experience that uh
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
vast majority of people don't trust them
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
they don't trust the particularly the
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
breath test particularly the breath test
 
00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
and with good reason um and and
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
um and so given that even if you pass
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
this it's going to be very difficult for
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
for us to to Envision any increase in
 
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
the in the uh uh taking of a test also
 
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that the um sanction can be
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
reduced by 180 days if one pleads guilty
 
00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
or noow is We Believe unconstitutionally
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
coercive and so we oppose the bill on
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
those grounds I do appreciate the
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
committee's time and I probably Ed up
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
more than the five minutes that I put
 
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
down but lawyers tend to do that anyway
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
we always we all excuse
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
me yeah yeah we Round Up by a lot
 
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes um
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
nevertheless if the committee does have
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
any questions I certainly would be more
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
than happy to try and answer them for
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
Youk if not I'm concluded thank you um
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
we have a few questions with regard to
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
this question um that seems to be the
 
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
Crux of your your opposition um with
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
regard to becoming a a criminal um
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
matter versus a
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
civil with our implied consent law in
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when you get a driver's
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
license you sign a document that says I
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
I understand that I have to comply and
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
consent to this test and if I don't
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
there'll be there'll be
 
00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
penalties and so they're increasing that
 
00:47:07.109 --> 00:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
penalty don't so it's more contract law
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
than criminal and don't most contracts
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
have a penalty if you fail to live up to
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
the contract I mean they don't become
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
criminal when a when a company says you
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
know you have to deliver X widgets by
 
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
this day or you incur a penalty it
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't become criminal because it's a
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
higher penalty so how do you equate that
 
00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:25.720 align:start position:0%
the two of those things well well
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
actually that's
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
to use your example that that's not
 
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
entirely true and I say that I say that
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
respectfully there are a number of um
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
for example your your contract example
 
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
um perhaps another example would be a
 
00:47:44.109 --> 00:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
non-competition agreement where a let's
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
say a doctor leaves a practice and
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
agrees not to practice medicine uh
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
within a certain number of miles for a
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
certain period of time um those
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
contracts and the San that are imposed
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh can be so punitive that in under
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
contract law which I readily admit is
 
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
certainly not my specialty but based on
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
on my my recollection of contract law
 
00:48:14.589 --> 00:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
can become um so honorous that it
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
becomes against public policy and
 
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.309 align:start position:0%
becomes against public policy and
therefore

00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
unenforceable similarly a non-cmp
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
agreement in the Civil context um if I
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
leave a medical practice un conquered um
 
00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
and my and my non-compete says that I
 
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
can't practice medicine anywhere east of
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
the Mississippi River for a period of 40
 
00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
years even if I sign that a court is
 
00:48:39.069 --> 00:48:39.079 align:start position:0%
never going to enforce it because we're
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
talking about reasonableness in the in
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
the contract context the the thing that
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult um in this situation
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman is is that yes you do sign a
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
paper we all do and and and honestly
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
none of us not a single person in this
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
room ever wants to be driving down the
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
road and have a vehicle on our side of
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
the road except going the wrong way
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
because they've been drinking nobody
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
wants that um but having having said
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
that um the the uh the the refusal
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
situation is it gets a little cumbersome
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
because while it's true that you sign
 
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
and apply
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
consent the legis lure has also created
 
00:49:28.319 --> 00:49:29.109 align:start position:0%
consent the legis lure has also created
a

00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
statute and that's it's statutory not
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional I and I could seeed that
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
point but the twain does meet at some
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
point or at least it has the potential
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
of meeting at some point and so um yes
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
you've impliedly consented to submit the
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
testing no question about it and as as
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
as a whole line of cases from the state
 
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
supreme court has said however the
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
legislature has essentially given
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
drivers the the statutory right which
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
could be taken away technically
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
statutory right to say no but as as the
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
court said and I I know citing cases
 
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
that's not going to impress anybody but
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
there there are a couple of cases out
 
00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:11.079 align:start position:0%
there that say basically you have a
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
statutory right to refuse but it comes
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
with strings strings are attached and
 
00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:21.079 align:start position:0%
those strings are first and foremost a
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
very rapid and potentially lengthy loss
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
of license simply because you said no
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
but then we have the line of cases where
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has not only
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
recognized um that you imply consent to
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
submit to testing but then they go on to
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
say very clearly that um the suspension
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
of a driver license in New Hampshire
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
cannot be undertaken by the appropriate
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
agency unless that person is afforded
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
due process and when one talks of due
 
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
process as New Hampshire has defined it
 
00:50:56.589 --> 00:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
that becomes something which is fun
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
fundamentally fair not only in the
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of the process but in the
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
sanction which is imposed and at some
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
point it becomes fundamentally unfair
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
and when that happens it's very much
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
like a contract which is against public
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
policy that sole difference is when you
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
have something against the public policy
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
the contract is
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
nullified when you do it in in the in
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
the context of what we're talking about
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
today that's when it has a very serious
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
and likely uh potential of becoming
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
criminal which is which is really going
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
to uh turn things upside down and it may
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
not be something that the legislature
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
wants to weigh into and probably the
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
court doesn't want to weigh into it but
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes uh as is it would be
 
00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:45.870 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes uh as is it would be
my

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
expectation um that it won't take very
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
long to get challenged that's that's not
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
something that I I mean to suggest I'm
 
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
not trying to be flip but but the but
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
the the very real Poss ility is there
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
and whether or not the statute uh when
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
passed is going to remain uh viable is
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
something I think that that this
 
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
committee needs to consider before uh
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
making a determination about its status
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you with regard to the um public
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
policy aspect if it offends public
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
policy doesn't it have to be so bad uh I
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
think the term is so as to offend the
 
00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:22.799 align:start position:0%
public conscience so do you feel like
 
00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
the one-year automatic would offend the
 
00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:25.510 align:start position:0%
the one-year automatic would offend the
public

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
conscience I I do okay and and and and
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
our committee does because there's no
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know if there was a provision in
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
there and far be it for me to you know
 
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
suggest legislative uh language but if
 
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
there was at least a provision in there
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
like there are in a number of states
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
where someone is subject to a
 
00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:49.799 align:start position:0%
significant penalty which may be deemed
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
civil if the person is subsequently
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
acquitted or found not guilty or
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
the case is dismissed or the state using
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
the the that arm of the the executive
 
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
branch of of the government chooses to
 
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
null PR then there certainly should be
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
something in the statute to ameliorate
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
the damage which is done by the lengthy
 
00:53:16.349 --> 00:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
suspension namely uh the ALS at that
 
00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:19.799 align:start position:0%
point should U should terminate thank
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
you um my last question is you brought
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
up the um CDL which is interesting the
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
the CDL um this would have serious
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
ramifications for their
 
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
licenses isn't the limit um what is the
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
what is the blood alcohol limit for a
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
CDL holder isn't it like zero or is it
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
02 it's much lower isn't it it it is
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
much lower it's it's um it is 0.004 04
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
however however what's important to
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
understand is that um and and that's
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
where some of the confusion Lies by the
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
way with the ALS form but I'll get to
 
00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
that in a moment if you allow me sure
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely um the uh uh the federal
 
00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
government under the code of federal
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
regulations has passed a number of
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
regulations dealing with commercial
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
driver licenses uh that was sort of
 
00:54:07.589 --> 00:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
brought to the Forefront when that
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
tremendously unfortunate situation arose
 
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.190 align:start position:0%
tremendously unfortunate situation arose
in

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
Randolph um that that came to the
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
Forefront now New Hampshire uh has
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
adopted the equivalent of those cfrs in
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
addressing CDL Drivers here in New
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so when a person who has a
 
00:54:32.589 --> 00:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
CDL is driving one of two different
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
kinds of vehicles and it matters what
 
00:54:34.079 --> 00:54:35.670 align:start position:0%
kinds of vehicles and it matters what
you're

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
driving a little bit more to confuse
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
these folks um if you are driving a
 
00:54:41.359 --> 00:54:42.390 align:start position:0%
these folks um if you are driving a
commercial

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle and there is an arrest made for
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
DWI the limit for CDL is
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
04 that's the law and we've adopted that
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
00:54:55.319 --> 00:54:57.190 align:start position:0%
here in New
Hampshire

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
008 for the legal
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
limit regardless of whether you're
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
driving a commercial vehicle or not for
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
purposes of the use of that breath test
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
in a subsequent Court
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
proceeding if you're driving a personal
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
car but possess a
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
CDL and you refuse to submit to Chemical
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
Testing by law the driver license
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
assuming a first offense under the
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
current statutory scheme you're driving
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
privilege your driver's license is
 
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
suspended for 6 months but your CDL is
 
00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
suspended for a
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
year just as importantly a refusal to
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
submit to a chemical test by a CDL
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
holder regardless of what type of
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle they're driving is considered to
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
be a serious or major offense for
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
purposes of CDL
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
sanctions um and of course we understand
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
why we certainly don't need someone I be
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
pardon the um automatic one year for the
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
CDL and the serious offense that's under
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
the CFR is are correct it is but we've
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
adopted that okay and and the problem
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
with that is if someone were to for
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
example refuse but not be convicted and
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
then subsequently be convicted that
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
would be two serious or major offenses
 
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
and that's a lifetime suspension subject
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
to you can petition to reinstate after
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
to 10 years and that's fine if you're 32
 
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:31.799 align:start position:0%
years old it's not so fine if you're 62
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
years old um so the CDL and there's a
 
00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion and I've represented a
 
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
whole lot of clients who have CDLs who
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
have refused Chemical
 
00:56:44.829 --> 00:56:44.839 align:start position:0%
Testing not withstanding that the DS smv
 
00:56:47.549 --> 00:56:47.559 align:start position:0%
426 form says
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
08 and I have a you know obviously
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
didn't bring it with me and and but I
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
can tell you I have a a body warn camera
 
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
video of of a conversation that occurred
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
in the case that I just resolved where
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
where there was a discussion between my
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
client and the police officer and he
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
said I can't I can't take that I I the
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
08 doesn't mean anything it's po it's 04
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
he was in his own pickup truck um but he
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
thought I have a CDL and they told me 04
 
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
no we have hands or butts so I I'm I'm
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
I'm over 04 but I'm under 08 but I can't
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
take your test because I'm over an 04
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
and most police officers with all due
 
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
respect tow enforcement they don't know
 
00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
a thing about the CDL penalties and that
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding is I don't even know if
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
they're taught that at standards and
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
training during the the DWI training
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
component so it seems to seems to me
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
that at the very minimum there has to be
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
a change in the form whereby it says
 
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
something like if you are a CDL holder
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
then this is what you need to to do and
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
there are actually several examples in
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
States like Georgia Wisconsin and Ohio
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
where the form actually has paragraphs
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with are you under 21 do you
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
have a CDL that type of thing do you
 
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
have a prior offense and the person who
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
was asked to sign the ALS form
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
indicating choice of taking or refusing
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
a test also was required to initial an
 
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
an applicable paragraph so that there
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
won't be any question should there be a
 
00:58:23.789 --> 00:58:23.799 align:start position:0%
challenge later on as to whether or not
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
they were properly advised of the of of
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
what sanctions apply to them thank you
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative Stone you have a question
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
my question as a practical matter in
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
your experience how often are ALS
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
hearings going forward these days or are
 
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
they negotiated way as part of the uh
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
resolution of the case
 
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.109 align:start position:0%
resolution of the case
overall

00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
um the the easy answer to that is a
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
number of them don't go forward because
 
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
the regulations of the DMV provide for
 
00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal of als's under two
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances one is in exchange for a
 
00:59:02.589 --> 00:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
guilty plea whereby a police department
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
although they're not required to uh can
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
submit um a letter to the DMV Bureau of
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
hearings in which they indicate that Mr
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
Smith pledge to a DWI in the conquered
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court um pursuant to this
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
regulation we would ask that the ALS be
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
withdrawn that's number one or there's
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
an error of law for example if someone
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh someone refused es um but it turns
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
out that the officer in the course of
 
00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
administering the ALS rights provided
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
misinformation in other words it's a
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
second it's a second offense the officer
 
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
knows that the individual says well how
 
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
long am I going to lose my license the
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
officer says 6 months which would be
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
incorrect information that's the kind of
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
error of law we're talking about
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
um there is no and I with all due
 
00:59:57.549 --> 00:59:57.559 align:start position:0%
respect to to attorney Casco uh
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
um there is no
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
provision at the Bureau of hearings
 
01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
where the state can essentially null PR
 
01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:08.039 align:start position:0%
an Als in other words withdraw it
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
without having to give a reason without
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
having to have a plea uh quite frankly I
 
01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
think it's a limitation on the executive
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
branch that is unconstitutional but I
 
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
digress so to answer your
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
question I would say that um
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
a vast number of ALS hearings don't go
 
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
forward but that often occurs under
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances where there's a plea
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
negotiation reached on the merits of the
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
DWI case which results in a plea to a
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
lesser included offense or a less
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
serious offense um such as reckless
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
driving that happens with with a great
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
deal of frequency um so those those
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
hearings don't go forward but um there
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
are a number of agencies where
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
regardless of the outcome of the the
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
criminal aspect of the case they won't
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
they won't touch the ALS they won't go
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
anywhere near it it's like it's a
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
refusal you know we're not going to
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
withdraw it so those hearings go forward
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
I I have to say that in my practice and
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
in my
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
experience I would
 
01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
say it's not a cop out but it's about
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
50/50 I it's pretty evenly
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
divided um in terms of those that have
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
to go to hearing and those that are are
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
otherwise resolved
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
whereby an individual withdraws his
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
request because of a plea agreement
 
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
reached in court um or um or the state
 
01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
withdraws it um not just for a DWI
 
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
conviction but because there may be some
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
some error of laws as is provided for
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
under the regulations representative
 
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair and it's just
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
a quick
 
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
question if this law were followed and
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
and a person were to ref refuse a test
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
does that then eliminate the possibility
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
that that uh that ple that the charge
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
may be pled down is how does
 
01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure respectfully I'm not
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
sure you have the administrative removal
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the license yes you you mentioned
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
pleading down to other lesser included
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
crimes is it what effect does this law
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
have on on that if
 
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
any none thank you
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
oh oh representative side not getting
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
out that easy I guess I I just want to
 
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
be sure I understand what you had said
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
and that is somebody I was under the
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
impression if you refuse it's automatic
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
no chance no uh discretion at all you
 
01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
lose your license for six months are you
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
telling me that if you plead on the
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
merits of the case to the D DUI in court
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
found guilty
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
you can still appeal to the DMV to get
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
the uh ALS removed yes that I didn't
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
realize that existed yes the way the way
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
it works it because of the because of
 
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
the current APP pellet uh law in in New
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is a case called State
 
01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
versus Cassidy goes back to 1997 I
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
believe they're treated separately
 
01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
so if a person plead
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
guilty and as part of that plea deal it
 
01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
would have to be with agreement with the
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
prosecution because it's not
 
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
mandatory even though perhaps it should
 
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
be but it's not the person pleads guilty
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor Vehicles has has
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
a regulation that allows the prosecution
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
to then cancel out whatever is left of
 
01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:53.240 align:start position:0%
the ALS however however um if a person
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.589 align:start position:0%
goes to
trial

01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
trial
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
and is found guilty that particular
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
regulation doesn't apply it's not
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't a plea it's after
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
you've gone to trial and when all of
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
that is said and done one can still
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
challenge the ALS as long as they submit
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
their hearing request within 30 days of
 
01:04:16.029 --> 01:04:16.039 align:start position:0%
the date of the arrest they can do that
 
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
separately or they can do it globally in
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
conjunction with an agreement with the
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
prosecution I I hope that answers your
 
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.230 align:start position:0%
prosecution I I hope that answers your
question

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
out that little tendril you put on the
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
end that I was under the impression that
 
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
if you had to negot
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
you pled guilty had to deal with the
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
prosecution the ALS was a separate issue
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
and part of the negotiation of the
 
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:50.839 align:start position:0%
accepting the guilty pleate would be
 
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
that the prosecution would move to get
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
rid of the ALS now you say the Little
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hook was that even if you go to trial
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
and are found guilty they can still that
 
01:05:05.549 --> 01:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
part that was that's a new element you
 
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
brought in even if they're found guilty
 
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
not a plea that they could still after
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
within 30 days or whatever you said
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
could still go to the DMV to try to get
 
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.710 align:start position:0%
could still go to the DMV to try to get
the

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
ALS uh lifted without the cooperation of
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
the prosecution is that true it
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
is because the regulation
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
uses specifically the word plea and so
 
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
it limits the ability to withdraw the
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
ALS to a circumstance where there's been
 
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
trial thank you no further questions
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%

01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:14.839 align:start position:0%
members uh for the record my name is
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
Eddie Edwards assistant commissioner at
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety to my right is
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Chris storm who is the
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
commander of our special services unit
 
01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
for the State Police to my left is
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
attorney Chris Casco who is the chief of
 
01:06:34.349 --> 01:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
our prosecutors and hearings
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau I just wanted the uh committee to
 
01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:40.839 align:start position:0%
note that this legislation is a part of
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
the Department's safey priority
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
legislation this year because of some of
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
the things that uh we're going to
 
01:06:49.269 --> 01:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
discuss this this morning one of those
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
things that was uh alarming and quite
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
concerning to the department was uh drug
 
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
cases these are cases involving alcohol
 
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
and marijuana fentanyl or cocaine other
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
um drugs one or more
 
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
drugs I'm sorry two or more drugs in
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
poly drug cases and
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
in9 New Hampshire there were 3% we that
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
was 3% of our uh cases in 2021 that
 
01:07:23.549 --> 01:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
represented 40% of our cases involving
 
01:07:26.269 --> 01:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
more than just alcohol and so so this
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
legislation is part of a broader public
 
01:07:30.269 --> 01:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
policy to make sure that New Hampshire
 
01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.349 align:start position:0%
policy to make sure that New Hampshire
roads

01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
roads
 
01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
are are safe for travel uh we've had a
 
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
number of uh deaths on our on our
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
roadways and uh we get an enormous
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
amount of interactions with families who
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
lost loved ones asking what New
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is doing and as you can
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
imagine I'm sure you've traveled on 101
 
01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
95 93 and you saw you've seen people
 
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
flying past you you've seen the the
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
crashes and so uh this is also impacting
 
01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
wrongway drivers which is another big
 
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
problem in our state uh as you can
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
imagine that's a 3,000 4,000 pound
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
weapon driving in the opposite direction
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
the headon traffic and uh that's
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
becoming an increasing uh problem for us
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh one of the primary reasons not the
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
sole reason but one of the primary
 
01:08:15.229 --> 01:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
reasons for wrongway drivers is
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
impairment so with that I I'll have uh
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
attorney Casco open some more open
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
comments and I'll turn over to
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant storm good morning Mr chair
 
01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record I'm
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
Chris Casco I'm an attorney for the
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety the rationale
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
behind this bill is to reduce the rate
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
of refusal for people who are arrested
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
for DUI in New Hampshire because it has
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
been a longstanding problem and looking
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
at the data one way to address that and
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
to encourage people to take a chemical
 
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
test is by changing the penalty for
 
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
refusal so that's what this Bill does
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
and I cite in my position paper some of
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
the data that shows New Hampshire
 
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
historically has had a high rate of
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
refusal as Senator Ganon told you at the
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
beginning almost seven out of 10 people
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
refuse to take a test and that's not
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
good for Public Safety and frankly it's
 
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
not always good for the individual
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
because what happens for a
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
refusal that suspension time runs
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
consecutively to any time of suspension
 
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
in court so encouraging people to take a
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
test will be helpful and that's what
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is attempting to do because it
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
will not change the law in New Hampshire
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
for those who take the test so for those
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
who take the test the suspension for a
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
test over the legal limit will stay the
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
same 180 days in 2 years because what
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
the data has suggested that state that
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
have a more significant penalty for
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
refusing like Vermont our neighbors to
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
the north they have much higher
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
suspension periods after First Defense
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
they have a
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
lifetime suspension and also a liftime
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
suspension with no right to get your
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
license back ever if you have subsequent
 
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
refusals so the data would suggest that
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
making a more significant license
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
suspension pen penalty will encourage
 
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
people to take a chemical test after
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
they are charged with
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
DUI another thing that this does that I
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone has touched upon in
 
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
terms of making something a second
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
offense this will add those who have a
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
refusal in another state will be a
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
predicate offense to make a longer
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
suspension period applicable whereas
 
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
under current law it needs to be a New
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire refusal or a New Hampshire
 
01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
prior DUI conviction so that's another
 
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
pretty important factor of this bill is
 
01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.870 align:start position:0%
pretty important factor of this bill is
to

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
allow a an out of state offense an out
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
of state refusal to constitute a
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
predicate offense which would make an
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
arrest here in New Hampshire a second
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
offense to which the longer suspension
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
periods will
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
apply another way that this bill
 
01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
encourages people to take take the
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
test is with the the current
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rule that attorney Moses
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
did do a good job of explaining was the
 
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of the ALS that can happen
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
under the administrative rules of the
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety this would limit
 
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal rule it wouldn't change
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
it for people who take the test if they
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
plead guilty to the DUI and they've
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
taken the test the state as part of a NE
 
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
negotiated plea will have the legal
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
Authority still they have the legal
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
Authority now to withdraw that entire
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
administrative license suspension as
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to under this bill the only time
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
you can reduce is 180 days in exchange
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
for a plea in court so you always will
 
01:12:18.629 --> 01:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
serve at least 180 days if you refuse
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
even if you plead guilty to DUI a
 
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense could be reduced from
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
three years to two .5 years so that will
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
make a significant difference because
 
01:12:32.189 --> 01:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
those who take the test and have tested
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
over could still have that withdrawn by
 
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
by entering a plea and it's important
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
for those entering a plea they accept
 
01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility there'll be
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and the mandatory Alcohol
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
counseling program
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
will act to rehabilitate people so the
 
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
more people we can get into counseling
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
to to address an underlying alcohol
 
01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
problem the better so those who take the
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
test they go to court they can have a a
 
01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
lesser license suspension they're
 
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
they'll be more likely to get into the
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
treatment and less likely to come before
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
the court again and be arrested for DUI
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
and then another piece of this that is
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
an incentive for those to take the test
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
is that for those who test High High to
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
the point of being an aggravated DWI a
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
0.16 or greater for someone who's 21 or
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
older right now someone convicted of
 
01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
aggravated based on a high test has a
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
mandatory jail sentence whereas this
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill will allow a judge to suspend that
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
entire sentence to just give further
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
encouragement for people to take the
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
test in New Hampshire I'm happy to take
 
01:13:54.719 --> 01:13:56.629 align:start position:0%
test in New Hampshire I'm happy to take
any

01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
questions and Lieutenant storm I think
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
can add definitely from the law
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement perspective as
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
well abut thank you very much uh my name
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
is Lieutenant Chris storm I am the
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
special services Commander for the
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Division of State
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
Police I uh I run the state police's um
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
impaired driving program um and also
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
serve on the New Hampshire impaired
 
01:14:19.149 --> 01:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
driving um task force um the New
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver uh impaired driving
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
task for has identified this refusal
 
01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
problem as our number one priority to um
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
fix um we are one of the worst states in
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
the entire country when it comes to
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
refusal um we need to fix that problem
 
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
right now the penalties are the exact
 
01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
same for whether you take the test or
 
01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
you don't take the test as far as the
 
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
statute so we need to stop that from
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
happening so that we can keep these
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
roadways safe we can stop these crashes
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
from happening and we can stop the
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
recidivism of people just continuing to
 
01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
drive um impaired here in our state and
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
with our neighbors right now and the
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
potential of that um marijuana
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
legislation passing um all of our
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
neighbors have recreational marijuana
 
01:14:58.990 --> 01:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing a higher increase of
 
01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
people that are utiliz the utilization
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
of marijuana on our roadways so we're
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
trying to stop that refusal rates from
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
happening so that we can actually um
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
keep our roadway safe by not having
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
these people out here driving impaired
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
um Chris hit all those points very very
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
well so I'd be both of us be more than
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
willing to answer any questions that you
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
have thank you yeah we have a few um I
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
think though you just hit a really
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
interesting point for me so right right
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
now if if you pull someone over and
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're let's assume they're
 
01:15:35.629 --> 01:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
0.09 okay they refuse to take the test
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
their license suspension is how much
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's a on the ALS side of the house it'
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
be 180 days and if they take the test
 
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
and they come up 0.009 what is the
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
license suspension 180 days so right now
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
there's no incentive to take the test I
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
might as well roll the dice and go to
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
trial is that pretty much much what I'm
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
you are correct representative okay and
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
if I may jump in really the the one
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
distinction is how the license
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
suspension if both are imposed after the
 
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
cas is is
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
finished the the refusal suspension time
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
would run consecutively or after the
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
court suspension but you kind of have to
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
look at both but the term is the exact
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
same for both the refusal
 
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
and susp if you were convicted did um
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
after refusing the test you could look
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
at 360 days of suspension is that what
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing yes you could 180 plus 180
 
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
they'd be on and after and you'd think
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
that would be an incentive but I think
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's just it's legal terminology to some
 
01:16:44.629 --> 01:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
extent legal ease for lack of a better
 
01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
term and the consecutive versus
 
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
concurrent is on the back of the form
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
but I think even lawyers it can be
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
confusing language so for the average
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
person to understand that distinction
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
based on using that terminology I think
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's just not it's it's been shown to
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
not be sufficient to encourage people to
 
01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
take the test and we think that
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
increasing the terms will be a much
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
better way to encourage
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
testing with regard to the um expansion
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
to to the out of state what is your look
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
back period going to
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
be the look back period essentially in
 
01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
law there is not a look back period but
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
the practice has been to use the same
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
10-year lookback period for the criminal
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
offense for DUI second it needs to be
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
within 10 years of the prior so that has
 
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
been the practice and refusal yes that's
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
in the practice 10 to use a 10-year look
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
back period okay um representative
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
scitec thank you Mr chair uh attorney
 
01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
Casco you used the word predicate
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
predicate case what's that mean just
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
meaning a condition to make something a
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
second offense so to be subject to right
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
now it's a
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
2-year suspension for refusing a second
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
time but right now you would need either
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
a prior DWI conviction which would be a
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
predicate offense or a prior refusal in
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which would be kind of a
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
condition a predicate offense would be
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
the prior condition that would make
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
something the second offense subject to
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
the longer suspension term this adds
 
01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
outof State DUI convictions in outof
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
state refusals to make someone subject
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
to the longer suspension period as
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
whereas right now if you have a prior
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
DUI conviction and you're arrested in
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
new h a prior DUI conviction in another
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
state Massachusetts for example and
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
you're arrested for DUI in New Hampshire
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
and you refuse use your time would be
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
180 days for a first offense because
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
under current law it does not recognize
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
an outof State conviction as something
 
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
that will make you subject to that
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
period I have a different question and
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
this uh Mr chair this may be out of
 
01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
order and I'll ask it offline of
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant storm but I I'd like to a
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
quick primer on what are these different
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
tests I hear chemical test I what's the
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
what what are could somebody tell us
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
what's in the the zoo of tests yeah that
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
would be actually a good idea because um
 
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Edwards mentioned
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
the the the drug issue as being a prime
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
driver of this however do we have a test
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
available for the drugs and let's talk
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
about that yeah absolutely so I can
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
easily answer that question for your
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
representative so there's there's
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
basically three different uh four
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
different um testing um things that
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
would happen first and foremost we'd
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
have our breath test that would come
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
under um our breath instrument the
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
second would be blood um obviously a
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
legal blood draw done and then the third
 
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
and the fourth are kind of in
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
conjunction with together the third is
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
say that individual doesn't um take
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
testing out on the side of the road we
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
read them their LS form they agree to
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
testing we can give them what they call
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
physical tests so that's our
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
standardized field sobriety battery and
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
then to to your point um about the drug
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
side of the house if they um if we feel
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
that they're under the influence of
 
01:20:25.550 --> 01:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
drugs we can do what they call a drug
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
recognition evaluation on that
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
particular individual so those are the
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
four those are the four cruxs of the
 
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
actual testing that we would do on a
 
01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
actual testing that we would do on a
particular

01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
individual can you explain the drug
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
recognition sure it's a u basically it's
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
a national program that is a 12-step
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
process that we go through that anybody
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
that we believe that is on something
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
other than just alcohol so once that
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
persons determine that they are not
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
impaired by alcohol and we believe that
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
they are impaired by a particular drug
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
we'll do a 12 12ep process to them that
 
01:20:57.990 --> 01:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
will be able to show the signs and
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
symptomology of that they are under the
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
influence of seven different drug
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
categories and basically every drug
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
category that will impair your ability
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
to drive would fall under one of those
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
seven drug categories and have the
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
courts recognized the uh the evidence of
 
01:21:13.629 --> 01:21:13.639 align:start position:0%
those tests as being admissible and
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
Reliant yes representative they have
 
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you and thank you for taking
 
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
my question my basic question is has
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
there been a huge increase from the
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety administering uh
 
01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
blood draws versus intoxilizer use I
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
believe we have that data um for you
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you right now the state of
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a whole not just the
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
department of safety or the the Troopers
 
01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:41.639 align:start position:0%
or anybody that works for us the state
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire as a whole does about
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
1750 um blood draws per year so from all
 
01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
agencies that would do a legal blood
 
01:21:54.189 --> 01:21:54.199 align:start position:0%
draw we're doing about 7 uh50 as far as
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
our breath testing
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
do um yeah I I can't tell you exactly
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
how many um we're doing we average in
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
the state roughly around um we've we've
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
decreased a lot in our DWI due to
 
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
Manning and um so forth but um last year
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
we were somewhere in the 3,000 range for
 
01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
total DWI that were brought into um
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
actual ALS forms that came into the um
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
to the DMP thank you representative
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question this might be kind of
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
silly but I'm wondering um why you want
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
to incentivize taking someone taking the
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
test if it's um an admission of guilt to
 
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
not take the test like if it's like kind
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
of either way I'm kind of confused like
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
why so that's a that's a great question
 
01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
so on the administrative side of the
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
house the the test or no test actually
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
kind of doesn't matter but on the
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
criminal side when you're actually in
 
01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
front of it the the best evidence is
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
obviously showing that that impairment
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
level so to be able to prove that case
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
and to make it so it's absolutely proper
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
the best thing to do is to have a test
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
to show that that particular individual
 
01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:07.639 align:start position:0%
was under either alcohol Andor drugs and
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
if I may add to that representative
 
01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
Murray I think a reason to incentivize
 
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
really for the citizens benefit is that
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
there's a perception out there in
 
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings about how much alcohol
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
equals an 08 and some people will think
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
gez I had one beer I might be in 08 they
 
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
get stopped they get arrested they don't
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
do well on the field sobriety tests and
 
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
if they're always told oh you just
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
refuse those that person who may be well
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
under the legal limit is going to refuse
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
and be in the system so it it gives them
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to show the officer that
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're actually not impaired and they
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
won't end up in the system so that
 
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's another good reason for testing
 
01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire into to not have this
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of oh you just always
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
refuse that which I think in New
 
01:24:00.270 --> 01:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to some degree that's what the
 
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
public thinks you just refuse
 
01:24:05.950 --> 01:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
PR so I heard testimony about the form
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't really very
 
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
explicitly say what happens if you don't
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
if you refuse is there a way we can make
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
that clearer so say this is the option
 
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
if you take the test you can be subject
 
01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
to this if you refuse the test this is
 
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
what's coming nice big bold so they get
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
it and and I also agree with you the
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
word on the street is just refuse
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
because it works out better for you
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes it does I guess sometimes it
 
01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't but that's what a lot of people
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
believe and I'm not really sure why if
 
01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
if this uh law is uh passed we will be
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
changing our form these the forms are
 
01:24:52.109 --> 01:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
laid out in Rule and that form will be
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
changed to reflect the new changes and
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh there will be a public hearing at the
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
department for that and it'll go before
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
jail car so we'll make sure that those
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you um the refusal rate which
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
seems to be drifting somewhere between
 
01:25:17.629 --> 01:25:17.639 align:start position:0%
70 and 80% seems really really high but
 
01:25:19.149 --> 01:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
there doesn't seem to be a huge amount
 
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
of difference between New Hampshire's
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
current statute and other states that
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
have refusal rates that are actually
 
01:25:25.639 --> 01:25:26.590 align:start position:0%
have refusal rates that are actually
much

01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
lower one of the things that I'm I'm
 
01:25:31.629 --> 01:25:31.639 align:start position:0%
really curious about are are there other
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
factors in addition to the uh uh the
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
severity of the penalty uh that impact
 
01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:45.149 align:start position:0%
severity of the penalty uh that impact
refusal

01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
rate yeah that that's a good question I
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
think probably in some of it as we've
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
just referenced that kind of word on the
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
street is that you just refuse you'll do
 
01:25:59.709 --> 01:25:59.719 align:start position:0%
better so I think that's that
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
contributes to it and I think some of it
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
may be the idea of hey I don't have to
 
01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
do that it's my right to refuse which I
 
01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
know certainly attorney Moses would
 
01:26:14.590 --> 01:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
argue yes there's an absolute right to
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
refuse in New Hampshire from my
 
01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
perspective because the implied consent
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
law is the way it is I I think that
 
01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
suggests that there really is no right
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
to refuse because your license is
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
suspended it's within 30 days after you
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
refuse and you can have a hearing but
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
you'll have to go to court and the two
 
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
are unrelated so you may serve a double
 
01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
license suspension if you contest
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
everything and you're found liable at
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
the hearing and found guilty in court so
 
01:26:52.270 --> 01:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
I think correcting the perception of
 
01:26:54.669 --> 01:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
there's this right to refuse in making
 
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
refuse making taking the test something
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
that is always not going to work in your
 
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
favor which I don't think is necessarily
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
accurate and and I know attorney Moses
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that a lot of people don't
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
trust the breath test and I think that's
 
01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
true to some degree although now in New
 
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have the intoxilizer 9000
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
machine which is a newer machine for a
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
long long time we had to have the
 
01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.109 align:start position:0%
long long time we had to have the
intoxilizer

01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
intoxilizer
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
5000 because the law in New Hampshire
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
from our Supreme Court was that we
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
needed to still use a machine that
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
produced a second sample capture tube
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
that could then be tested so for a long
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
time we had to use old technology for
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
the breath test we finally were able to
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
amend the statute to go to the newer
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
technology that does not provide a
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
second sample but someone has the
 
01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
absolute right to get an independent
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
sample of their blood at a hospital in
 
01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to either corroborate or
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
not corroborate the breath test so I
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
think if there's some education about
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
the process to some degree maybe you get
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
more people taking the test and you
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
don't get people getting arrested who
 
01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
had one beer because they think refusing
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
is the right thing to
 
01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.709 align:start position:0%
is the right thing to
do

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
follow would it be fair to say that
 
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
maybe what we have here uh is maybe more
 
01:28:26.109 --> 01:28:26.119 align:start position:0%
of a failure to communicate than a
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
penalize respectfully representative
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
that that administrative license
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
suspension form that we have been
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
talking about is a very detailed form I
 
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
know attorney Moses focused on the
 
01:28:44.709 --> 01:28:44.719 align:start position:0%
aspect that it doesn't tell a CDL holder
 
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
what the consequences are and that's
 
01:28:49.149 --> 01:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
correct in our Supreme Court has had
 
01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
cases looking at consequences of
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
refusing or taking the test and I don't
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
want to get too far into the weeds but
 
01:28:58.510 --> 01:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court looks at whether
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
something is a direct consequence which
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
is something that needs to be on the ALS
 
01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
form as opposed to an indirect
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
consequence that does not an example of
 
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
a direct consequence that is one of the
 
01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
questions on the form is that the person
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
has to be told that if they refuse that
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
will be admissible in court because
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
that's a direct consequence as opposed
 
01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:24.590 align:start position:0%
that's a direct consequence as opposed
to

01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
someone does not need to be told that if
 
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
there a one six or more that's an
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
aggravated DWI subject to a higher
 
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
penalty that has been ruled to be an
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
indirect consequence so far the CDL
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
consequences have been ruled by our
 
01:29:43.709 --> 01:29:43.719 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts to be indirect and I
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
would suggest that a CDL license holder
 
01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
needs to have a higher knowledge level
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
of the law and that they should really
 
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
know full well that even if they're in
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
their own car if they refuse they should
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
know as that part of that higher level
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
of knowledge that a a special license
 
01:30:04.990 --> 01:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
holder should have they really should
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
have a higher degree of knowledge and
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
should know that if they refuse their
 
01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
CDL will be suspended for a year because
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
they're entrusted with driving tractor
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
trailer trucks out on our roadways and
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
we need to be sure those people are safe
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
and they know the law and they have a
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
special license just like I had a
 
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:26.639 align:start position:0%
license to practice law so I should be
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
held to a higher standard of certain
 
01:30:33.870 --> 01:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.109 --> 01:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
person could you um touch on where this
 
01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
let's say this gets passed and the
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
governor signs it where would that put
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
us as far as Across the Nation goes um
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to this would we be the
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
highest the middle lowest where will we
 
01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
be as far as the are you saying as far
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
as the
 
01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.430 align:start position:0%
as the
penalty

01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
that would be on par with many many many
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
states already that have that um there
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
are some that are similar to us there
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
across the board it's all probably on
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
that first offense anywhere from I've
 
01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
seen um as uh low as 90 days all the way
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
up to the year the ones that have the
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
lower are the ones that are higher as
 
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
far as the refusal rates go okay so to
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
lower the automatic suspension the
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
higher the refusal rate the lower the
 
01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
conviction rates for oui I don't know
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
about the conviction rate NE
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
I could get but in Hampshire um without
 
01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
the tests uh would you in Hampshire with
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
more people refusing that would assume
 
01:31:36.669 --> 01:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
that that would lead to lower conviction
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
rates because you don't have the
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
evidence is that true or not in some
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
instan yes it is okay representative
 
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
Newell thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I have kind of
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
a two-parter if you don't mind and um it
 
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
speaking about kind of the poly
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
substance cases is and uh you referenced
 
01:31:57.629 --> 01:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
that there up you know 2009 it was 3% up
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
to I think you said 40% in 2021 and I'm
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
I'm so the first part of my question is
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
is that based on the uh right around 20%
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
of the cases that we test that that
 
01:32:11.709 --> 01:32:11.719 align:start position:0%
people do actually take the test it just
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
seems like a pretty small sampling if
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
we're trying to have accurate numbers
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
those are a um result of test uh testing
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
done by our Prime lab So based upon all
 
01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:24.590 align:start position:0%
done by our Prime lab So based upon all
of

01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
cases that came
 
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
in okay so even if somebody refused the
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
test they would still be tested and that
 
01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:33.119 align:start position:0%
would be included in this data not not
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
that they refuse okay we wouldn't know
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
okay um the other part of my question if
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
you don't mind me follow okay um the
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
other part of my question is about um
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know in keeping with the poly
 
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
substance um in marijuana being one of
 
01:32:48.109 --> 01:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
the examples alcohol and marijuana um
 
01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:49.719 align:start position:0%
but marijuana stays in your system for a
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
lot longer and so my question is is that
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration um when we're
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
when uh defining whether or not that
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
would actually impair someone's driving
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
so I can speak a little bit to that so
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
there's there's a couple different
 
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
things so yes marijuana absolutely
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
metabol marijuana stay in your system
 
01:33:08.910 --> 01:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
for for quite some time the active
 
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
actual agent um Delta 9 tetrah hydr
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
canaban the actual impairing agreement
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't stay in your system
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
very long so we get that hopefully get
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
that blood tested um quickly hence part
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
of the need to have a uh no refusal side
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
of the house so we can actually get that
 
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
evidence the carboxy and hydroxy
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
metabolites do stay in your but those
 
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
are not impairing substance it just
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
basically shows that there was a
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
presence or that you actually had done
 
01:33:34.830 --> 01:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
that but the actual impairing ingredient
 
01:33:37.149 --> 01:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
that Delta 9 tetrahydrogen Abol that's
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
what we're actually looking for thank
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Stone thank you and
 
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
currently under ALS how do we handle uh
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
narcotics only or non-narcotic is that
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
still a penalty or is it treated
 
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
differently under the
 
01:33:56.189 --> 01:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drugs are treated the exact
 
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
same way so if you so if you take the if
 
01:34:02.109 --> 01:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
you refuse to take the test um the
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
refusal stuff is the same if you take
 
01:34:06.669 --> 01:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
the test on a drug related case there is
 
01:34:06.679 --> 01:34:07.709 align:start position:0%
the test on a drug related case there is
no

01:34:07.709 --> 01:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
AOS so it actually only applies to the
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
alcohol currently correct if on the
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
refusal side of the house it is both
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drugs if you take the test
 
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
it only applies to alcohol follow isn't
 
01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
that kind of problematic it is but
 
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
there's a couple different different
 
01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
reasons for that um we um we don't want
 
01:34:29.229 --> 01:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
to change that because if you
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
representative took a certain kind of
 
01:34:32.109 --> 01:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
drug and you've been taking it for 30
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
years and you come back positive for
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
that particular drug that's not
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily a good thing for us to then
 
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
suspend your license for something that
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
you've been taking for 30 years does
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
that make sense followup wouldn't the uh
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
State chemist be able to testify about
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
the levels that are in your body if was
 
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
causing impairment during your operation
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
of a motor vehicle so at no point and
 
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
the and
 
01:34:55.629 --> 01:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
the department of safety is never going
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
to want to have per limit for any drugs
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
because there is no scienic data that
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
shows that having a per se limit for any
 
01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
particular drug it's it's variable to
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
dependent on that particular individual
 
01:35:09.990 --> 01:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
so we could never actually set a level
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
um representative tenar could take in um
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
Xanax for the first time in his life and
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
be extremely impaired um you know
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
representative Newell could have been
 
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
taking it for 30 years and her levels
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
would be so much higher but she actually
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be impaired where
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative tzar could be falling
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
down drunk thank you so it's a
 
01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:30.679 align:start position:0%
combination of the officer observations
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
of their operation combined with the
 
01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:35.239 align:start position:0%
levels that come back from the tests
 
01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
that give you the full picture of that
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
operator's uh condition so the refusal
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
takes away a big part of that so all
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
that were left is what the officer sees
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
as far as whether or not someone's
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
inebriated or intoxicated you're 100%
 
01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you that's
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
particularly true with drugs because the
 
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
only only way to do that is with a Dr a
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
drug recognition
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
expert um representative N I see you and
 
01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:03.750 align:start position:0%
expert um representative N I see you and
represent

01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
Murray representative Newman thank you
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I'm just curious I'm
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
thinking about a first offender type
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
thing um is there currently available in
 
01:36:16.830 --> 01:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
the state a limited type license for the
 
01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
purposes of continued employment or
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
something like that and if so does this
 
01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
law affect that there is a ship license
 
01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:27.159 align:start position:0%
and it does not this would not affect
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
any part of the hardship license for
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
that first offender and that's for a New
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident
 
01:36:34.990 --> 01:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
only represent
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um I just
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask a clarifying question
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
because I believe Senator Ganon said
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
that this is now only about the alcohol
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
testing but we've been talking about the
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
drug testing as well so I was just
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand if it's about if
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
we're addressing both concerns at this
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
bill so so the answer to that is we're
 
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
addressing the fact of the refusal for
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
all substances the um and what Senator
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
Ganon was correct as far as the alcohol
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
side of the house that doesn't affect it
 
01:37:07.390 --> 01:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
very much for anything that someone
 
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
that's actually participating and taking
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
a test nothing is going to change as far
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
as if you take a test and it's alcohol
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
related nothing will
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
change in fact in as um attorney Casco
 
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
said the one thing that we did um change
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
is the fact that if someone blows over
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
that point 6 we don't want to penalize
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
them for cooperating with the police we
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity if something is so
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
egregious that that opportunity will
 
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
still be
 
01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
there but it is not fair to just
 
01:37:37.149 --> 01:37:37.159 align:start position:0%
penalize someone if you're a030 and you
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
refuse you get the same thing as someone
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
that is a 0.8 if you take the test and
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
you're and you're cooperating with the
 
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
police and you come back at a 016 now
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to send you to jail we
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
didn't find that to be and I think
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
everybody would say that that's not a
 
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
fair thing to do we still have that
 
01:37:54.189 --> 01:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity if the case is egregious to
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
that you'd have to end up going because
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
it's still aggravated DWI but we will
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
will be able to suspend that jail
 
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
sentence for someone that's willing to
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
cooperate and help um and you know
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
basically take ownership for what
 
01:38:04.679 --> 01:38:05.470 align:start position:0%
basically take ownership for what
they've

01:38:05.470 --> 01:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
they've
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
done so for clarification for the
 
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
committee this would stiffen the the
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
penalty for refusal but at the same time
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
it gives the opportunity to take away
 
01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
the minimum mandatory on the aggravated
 
01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
oui because currently if someone's
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
aggravated it's an automatic um sentence
 
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
to jail
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
correct and if they take the test and
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
they're over that the judge can use
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
discretion and say okay no um that's
 
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
100% correct so okay thank you any
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
Pratt thanks for taking my question um
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
you were talking about testing do you
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
use uh like urine testing Vans for
 
01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:46.470 align:start position:0%
use uh like urine testing Vans for
commercial

01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
only New Hampshire is no longer a urine
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
State at all we do not test urine at our
 
01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
state laboratory um other than through
 
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
the department Corrections for certain
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
parole um but as far as impairment or
 
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
out there we do not use urine anymore
 
01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:01.750 align:start position:0%
out there we do not use urine anymore
okay

01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%

bossy here to introduce Senate Bill 313
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Senator Pearl the Bill's
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor this bill is a request
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Corrections to
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
update our criminal code to reflect the
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
realities of the 21st century mamus a
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
term I didn't know until this bill was
 
01:40:05.229 --> 01:40:05.239 align:start position:0%
filed is a legal term for the official
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
documentation accompanying a person
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
convicted and sentenced to the
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections current law
 
01:40:13.229 --> 01:40:13.239 align:start position:0%
requires the clerk of the court to
 
01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
deliver a copy to the Department of
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
Corrections but does not specify that
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
such delivery can take place
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
electronically during the pandemic the
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
courts and correction system greatly
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
increased their e filing capabilities
 
01:40:27.790 --> 01:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
and found that this method worked quite
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
well but the stat and while the statute
 
01:40:33.149 --> 01:40:33.159 align:start position:0%
does not prohibit electronic delivery of
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
sentencing documents it doesn't
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
specifically mention them either s SP
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
313 would clarify that electronic
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
delivery is allowed the bill also
 
01:40:43.149 --> 01:40:43.159 align:start position:0%
requires delivery of mamus to the
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
arresting municipality and requires doc
 
01:40:48.990 --> 01:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
to examine the documents to ensure their
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
authenticity sp sp 313 would clarify RSA
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
662 8 and N to better reflect current
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
practice and to ensure that communities
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
receive notice when people they've
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
arrested are sentenced to State Prison
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions I would defer

Graham

01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
I just say that nimus is a verb of the
 
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
send good morning Mr chairman members of
 
01:41:47.709 --> 01:41:47.719 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Jane Graham I
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
am the Strategic Communications
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
administrator for the New Hampshire
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections uh the New
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Corrections uh
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
asked uh Senator Pearl to bring this
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
bill forward I don't want to uh get too
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
much into um Mr bossy's testimony
 
01:42:05.229 --> 01:42:05.239 align:start position:0%
because it's pretty much the same as the
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
one that we have prepared this is just a
 
01:42:10.589 --> 01:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
reflect updating the language to uh
 
01:42:12.589 --> 01:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
specifically mention that we're allowed
 
01:42:15.589 --> 01:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
to accept a Minimus electronically so we
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
are getting that sentencing document
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
primarily electronically directly from
 
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
the court now whereas in the past it
 
01:42:24.669 --> 01:42:24.679 align:start position:0%
would be hand deled um with that
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
endorsement from the
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
sheriff does any I'm happy to take
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
questions so just for clarity for
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
everybody all this is doing is bringing
 
01:42:37.390 --> 01:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
our paper system electronic for handling
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
Ms is that it is yes any
 
01:42:44.189 --> 01:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative Jam you turned your head
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
just I waved I didn't recognize the
 
01:42:48.159 --> 01:42:49.669 align:start position:0%
just I waved I didn't recognize the
haircut

01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
haircut
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
okay thanks uh my my only question is it
 
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
says here department is committed to
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
carefully examining each Minimus
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
received through electronic channels to
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
ensure its authenticity can you speak to
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
how you're doing that is it like a
 
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up phone
 
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
call the Minimus is coming directly from
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
the court system so we're receiving it
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
directly from directly from the clerk of
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
the courts so we can see where it's
 
01:43:14.719 --> 01:43:18.750 align:start position:0%
the courts so we can see where it's
coming

01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.030 --> 01:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
from thank you thank you see no further

cards anyone here wishing to testify in
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%

01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
anything about Senate Bill

anything about Senate Bill
425

01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
I well I have a conflict I'm not sure
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
whether I'll participate or not but
 
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we wait for 318 to come back
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
from Finance before we do anything with
 
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
this well that would that would assume
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
we had a public hearing and didn't uh go
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
to an executive session but yeah are you
 
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
going to introduce this one or we 25
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
okay I have learned lot here this
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
morning so it's like you're doing a good
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
committee here um this is relative to
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners fees I happen to know
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
some of them are behind me um a lot of
 
01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners and I've watched the
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
last dozen years or so as they've been
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
paid the same $40 no gas and there is a
 
01:44:42.910 --> 01:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
lot of talk that eventually maybe we'll
 
01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
have a whole different system we'll have
 
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
paid Comm you know more educated or
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
something uh bail Commissioners but at
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
the moment and we've been doing this
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
year after year we not giving them any
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
more money we don't give them mileage uh
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
the cost of living you can probably tell
 
01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
me representative $40 12 or 14 years ago
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's probably should be 80 to 100 um my
 
01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
local bail commissioner um who will be
 
01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
speaking behind me goes out many
 
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
Saturday nights at 2 in the morning
 
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
drives to Manchester interviews the
 
01:45:17.550 --> 01:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
person sees if someone who should you
 
01:45:19.629 --> 01:45:19.639 align:start position:0%
know it can be a criminal case could be
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
something he has to decide whether or
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
not in many circumstances whether or not
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
they get out or not um and so he has a
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
huge responsibility um very important to
 
01:45:32.669 --> 01:45:32.679 align:start position:0%
our community um it's part of the bail
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
problems probably um that we're all
 
01:45:37.589 --> 01:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
trying to address and other bills and
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
he's getting $40 and that's so by the
 
01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
time he drives to Manchester's home he's
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
probably spending $10
 
01:45:47.589 --> 01:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
$15 they don't get paid every time some
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
um so now you're down to $25 sometimes
 
01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
for something that's could take him 1 or
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
two in the morning he gets home at 4:
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
or5 in the morning he's walking out
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
there with $25 maybe um so we think
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
until we address what we really want to
 
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
do with um fail Commissioners whether or
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
not that's going to be a much more uh
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
educated Force who has criminal you know
 
01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
degrees and something pertaining to this
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime while we're dealing
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
with the system and the people we have
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
are doing a great job the $40 just isn't
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
commensurate with the respons
 
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and the costs they have
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
so we in the meantime till we address it
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
in a more detailed fashion would like to
 
01:46:32.589 --> 01:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
pay them slightly more again it's
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
including their gas mileage which they
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
don't get a separate fee for so 40 would
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
like to make to 60 still not even near
 
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
keeping up with the cost of living but
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
just recommend recognizing these people
 
01:46:46.910 --> 01:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
that they're doing a hard job uh we if
 
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
we paid these people $100,000 each this
 
01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
roughly a hundred of them Plus benefits
 
01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
we're looking 10 to 15 million with
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
Benefits we're saving it he's going out
 
01:46:58.589 --> 01:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
and he's collecting on his own on a
 
01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
credit card so we're saving the state
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
tens of probably $10 million a year it's
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
a wonderful system for us financially um
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
we can get into details whether or not
 
01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
it's the best system but in the meantime
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
would like to and he's um the gentleman
 
01:47:15.790 --> 01:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
behind us will be testifying they're
 
01:47:18.589 --> 01:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
losing bail Commissioners all the time
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
the burden is going on an aging group of
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
people to turn out at 2: in the morning
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
and it's just it's not sustainable but
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
in the meantime the some of them are
 
01:47:29.589 --> 01:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
leaving because of this $40 is all
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
they're getting would like to retain the
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
ones we have as long as we want to keep
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
this system in place that's all I really
 
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
have to say thank you Senator and I I'm
 
01:47:40.030 --> 01:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that every version of the
 
01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
bill that's flying around all raises
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
their pay so okay we're we're very
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
friendly to that idea okay thank you
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
very much thank
 
01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
you sorry thought it was clear you're
 
01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:54.390 align:start position:0%

01:47:58.109 --> 01:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
a sir before you leave could you fill
 
01:47:59.589 --> 01:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
out one of those pink cards so we have
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
them for our records as to who testified
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
you don't have to do it right now just
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
yeah before you I didn't know that's
 
01:48:06.669 --> 01:48:06.679 align:start position:0%
okay my name is Eddie menis I'm from
 
01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
Sandown New Hampshire um been a bail
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner for eight
 
01:48:16.589 --> 01:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
years and longer as uh each day
 
01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
progresses it's a fascinating
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
job um I believe you're ba commissioner
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
Mr St so it's a learning curve when you
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
first get appointed I'm very
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in the law I make it my my
 
01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
duty to know what's going on and how to
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
implement what I have to
 
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
do I know we're only here for the the
 
01:48:41.790 --> 01:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
money aspect of it and it is low there's
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
no question about
 
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
it everything that the Senate has said
 
01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:46.870 align:start position:0%
it everything that the Senate has said
is

01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
true but in our family growing up when
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
you take a a job you do the job to the
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
best of your ability that's how we were
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
raised I know some of my fellow bail
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that aren't doing it
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
anymore it was the money issue that
 
01:49:07.470 --> 01:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
dissuaded them from
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
continuing and they were extremely
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and people that I bird dog
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
with to learn the
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
process Course once I did learn the
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
process they changed the paperwork a
 
01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.709 align:start position:0%
process they changed the paperwork a
year

01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
later but you just keep learning and
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
helping other bail Commissioners when
 
01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
they call you the ones with the
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
extensive knowledge get the phone calls
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
from people who are just coming on board
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
to actually what to do in certain
 
01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:39.320 align:start position:0%
instances and that's a real nice thing
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
when you have a network of people that
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
help each other I hope you all
 
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate what we do we do it to help
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
the police the state police the
 
01:49:53.550 --> 01:49:53.560 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Department and we're basically
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
on call 24 hours a day seven days a
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
week and I hope that they raise the fee
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
to at least
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
$60 as an incentive to maybe other
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
people coming on board if you have any
 
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be happy
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
them represent
 
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I was just
 
01:50:22.350 --> 01:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
wondering we've heard a lot from bail
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
Commission in this committee um not only
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
about you know the fee being too low but
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
also an inability to collect that fee um
 
01:50:32.189 --> 01:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if that's been
 
01:50:32.199 --> 01:50:35.189 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if that's been
your

01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:38.719 align:start position:0%
experience the I do very well on
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
collecting the
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
10% do I like that
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
no some people just don't have
 
01:50:54.669 --> 01:50:54.679 align:start position:0%
it it's not going to
 
01:50:58.350 --> 01:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
happen and you go into this knowing that
 
01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.470 align:start position:0%
happen and you go into this knowing that
all

01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
right obviously sometimes people um pass
 
01:51:08.830 --> 01:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
away too because they were on uh
 
01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:10.189 align:start position:0%
away too because they were on uh
different

01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
items I just want one other thing I'd
 
01:51:14.589 --> 01:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
like to say I'm glad I was here for the
 
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
earlier one it was really informative
 
01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:19.030 align:start position:0%
earlier one it was really informative
for

01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:51:22.030 --> 01:51:22.040 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:51:30.589 --> 01:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
question I I want to note that uh after
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
youve build two people under this if
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
this bill passed you actually make more
 
01:51:36.669 --> 01:51:36.679 align:start position:0%
than we do but that that nor
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
withstanding I the last part of this the
 
01:51:42.189 --> 01:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
last sentence is if if defendant is IND
 
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
Indigent the fee is
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
waved that's current law uh can you
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
explain how you determine if if a uh
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
defendant is indigent so that you can
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
wave that for them the judge when they
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
go to court the judge determines that
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
gather thank you and my understanding is
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
when you make contact with them at the
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
police station to to state their bail
 
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
what the bail conditions will be um that
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
is when you take that fee correct
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
correct if they have it thank
 
01:52:23.709 --> 01:52:23.719 align:start position:0%

02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
legislation in ensuring the safety of
 
02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens and protecting
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
critical infrastructure from potential
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
threats caused by these small drones um
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um at this point I would
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
like to conclude my testimony because I
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
know many of you have dealt with the
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
issue of drones for those of you who've
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
been here for a while but um the Senate
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
amended the bill and it's there seems to
 
02:03:46.750 --> 02:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
be an issue with the amendment of the
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill um we there was a request that we
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
take out a certain portion of it and we
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
did we've subsequently found out that it
 
02:03:58.350 --> 02:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
was critical to the bill and so I just
 
02:04:01.069 --> 02:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to alert all of you to the fact
 
02:04:03.149 --> 02:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
that it probably should go back in the
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
bill um and the this committee and you
 
02:04:09.149 --> 02:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman in your wisdom will figure
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
out how to do that so um we do have
 
02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
people here from the Department of
 
02:04:16.830 --> 02:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
Safety that are can uh discuss the need
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
for this bill and so I would thank you
 
02:04:21.549 --> 02:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
all for your time and your consideration
 
02:04:23.950 --> 02:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
this this morning thank you if you could
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
just leave us with that piece that you
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
took out we'd be happy to put it back
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
for you they they have that thank
 
02:04:36.189 --> 02:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
Muse the the amendment that you refer of
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
could you're referring to could you just
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
just tell us really quickly what uh I'm
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
sorry the the original bill that you
 
02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
would like to put back in can you just
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
summarize really quickly what that
 
02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
involves well the Senate we passed a
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
amendment number 02 0821 s um and it
 
02:04:58.470 --> 02:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
took out the
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
section um and I believe it it was
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out to me um exactly where it is
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but we had received a
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
request to take that out and so we took
 
02:05:13.149 --> 02:05:13.159 align:start position:0%
it out they'll be able to show you
 
02:05:16.149 --> 02:05:16.159 align:start position:0%
exactly where it is and I did have one
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
one quick
 
02:05:20.589 --> 02:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
followup as the prime sponsor I know
 
02:05:23.669 --> 02:05:23.679 align:start position:0%
you're you're aware of the fact that um
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
there have been several incidents uh
 
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
with drones dropping things uh on people
 
02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
the bill seems to be limited to things
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
like dangerous projectiles bombs and
 
02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
things of that nature in also in in 2023
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
there was an incident in Manchester
 
02:05:41.950 --> 02:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
where feces and garbage and other things
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
were dropped on homeless people would
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
you have any objection to uh widening
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
the scope of the bill to include things
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
of that nature thank thank you for the
 
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
question um representative we didn't get
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
testimony to uh incidents of happening
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
of things like that I think we can all
 
02:06:04.629 --> 02:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
agree that that's really reprehensible
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
behavior and if the committee in working
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Safety feels that
 
02:06:11.709 --> 02:06:11.719 align:start position:0%
it needs to be included I don't as the
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill I wouldn't
 
02:06:16.549 --> 02:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
have any issue with
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%

bill online last night and I saw two
 
02:06:32.669 --> 02:06:32.679 align:start position:0%
Senate amendments but I didn't see how
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%

the threats that we are seeing with um
 
02:08:34.109 --> 02:08:34.119 align:start position:0%
the uas and why this bill is so
 
02:08:36.750 --> 02:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
important to be able to pass um and
 
02:08:38.189 --> 02:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear afterwards from our
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh friends at dot um Aeronautics uh in
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
reference to um the problem uh with the
 
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
small unmanned aerial systems also known
 
02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
as uas or drones one of the biggest
 
02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
things that um we we're having right now
 
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
is that we have no way to enforce any
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
things that are happening um to
 
02:08:59.589 --> 02:08:59.599 align:start position:0%
representative Muse's um point that um
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
situation that happened in Manchester um
 
02:09:04.030 --> 02:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
we're absolutely aware of that that's AB
 
02:09:06.030 --> 02:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely reprehensible and we need
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
something to be able to go out and
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually enforce those um those federal
 
02:09:13.390 --> 02:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
laws right now part 107 which you'll see
 
02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
is part of those handouts you'll see a
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff about the U Federal um
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations right now they're
 
02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
barely being enforced by anybody through
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
the federal um Aviation Administration
 
02:09:26.430 --> 02:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
what we're asking is basically to adopt
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
those federal regulations and make them
 
02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
into a state law so that we have that
 
02:09:34.430 --> 02:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
ability to go out and actually um
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
enforce those laws unfortunately with
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
the new amendment that just came with
 
02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
that bill those were stripped out and
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
that first part was stripped out so we
 
02:09:44.549 --> 02:09:44.559 align:start position:0%
need that to be put back in there so
 
02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
that we can actually go out and do it um
 
02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
a little context to how this bill came
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
across we have a um a uas threat working
 
02:09:54.270 --> 02:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
group that we have people from not only
 
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
the department of safety the New
 
02:09:57.350 --> 02:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Fusion Center Department of
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics private sector folks people
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
from the utilities people from the
 
02:10:03.950 --> 02:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
United States military um other Federal
 
02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
entities that we've all gotten together
 
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
to say what can we do about this problem
 
02:10:09.910 --> 02:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
that is a very large problem here in New
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that we don't want
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
anything to happen everybody can see all
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
the stuff that's happening worldwide
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
with drones and we don't want that
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
happening here but we also need a way to
 
02:10:23.069 --> 02:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
um help stop that and help educate the
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
public into making this um a not okay
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
thing what we don't want to do is stop
 
02:10:30.669 --> 02:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
people from using drones they are good
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
use there there's lots of good uses for
 
02:10:34.830 --> 02:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
them we are not trying to stop the use
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
of drones at all I just got one for
 
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
Christmas so I'm going to kill this dead
 
02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
if you're going to take that absolutely
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
not and and in fact as far as the public
 
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
safety goes they are becoming something
 
02:10:47.069 --> 02:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
that we are utilizing almost on a daily
 
02:10:49.950 --> 02:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
basis um as far as Public Safety um the
 
02:10:52.189 --> 02:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
fire service all sorts of different um
 
02:10:54.109 --> 02:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
entities that are using them for actual
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
good unfortunately there are people that
 
02:10:57.310 --> 02:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
are using them for not good it's the
 
02:10:59.069 --> 02:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
same as a car right like we need a car
 
02:11:00.270 --> 02:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
to get everywhere we need a car to do
 
02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
all sorts of things but you can do a lot
 
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
of bad things with a car so we're trying
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
to solve that problem here in New
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by letting the and having some
 
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation so that we can stop
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
this from happening so the biggest thing
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
to this legislation is to allow us to
 
02:11:15.069 --> 02:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
enforce those Federal rules under part
 
02:11:18.030 --> 02:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
107 which are all within our original
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment so hopefully this group is
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
willing to um
 
02:11:23.910 --> 02:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh go into that subcommittee or wherever
 
02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
we need to go to add that language back
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
into the original format of that bill
 
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
and uh Mr kovar will be able to talk
 
02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
somewhat about um where some of that
 
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
stuff may have come out afterwards on on
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
his private sector um side of the house
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
and I'll let Adam kind of go into what
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
um just so that you guys kind of get a
 
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
basic brief of what we're dealing with
 
02:11:44.669 --> 02:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as far as some of these
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
um drone problems so that you actually
 
02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
know when we can make a good um decision
 
02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
as a group thank you appreciate the time
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
again again Adam Chelli I've served as a
 
02:11:54.669 --> 02:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
critical infrastructure analyst for the
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
past three and a half years at the New
 
02:11:59.229 --> 02:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire information analysis Center um
 
02:12:01.149 --> 02:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
one quick note on on the section that
 
02:12:04.270 --> 02:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
was was removed
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
sorry uh just to highlight kind of the
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
importance of of that section that was
 
02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
removed so FAA back in 2021 did a study
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh in a sampling period where they
 
02:12:16.669 --> 02:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
detected almost 500,000 suas flights uh
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
from a population of
 
02:12:21.549 --> 02:12:21.559 align:start position:0%
116,000 uh different platforms so some
 
02:12:23.549 --> 02:12:23.559 align:start position:0%
of the activity that was identified in
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
that study falls into that first
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
category uh that has been removed and we
 
02:12:29.790 --> 02:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
think is really important uh that that
 
02:12:32.589 --> 02:12:32.599 align:start position:0%
stays in the bill a couple examples uh
 
02:12:35.470 --> 02:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
so beyond uh visual line of sight that's
 
02:12:37.470 --> 02:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
a dangerous operation it's a negligent
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
use uh if you don't you're not able to
 
02:12:41.830 --> 02:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
see where that uh vehicle's going uh
 
02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
that's unsafe 133% of that 470,000 uh
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
was beyond visual line of sight 21% was
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
above 400 ft so again you can get into
 
02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
the those dangerous air corridors and 25
 
02:12:55.390 --> 02:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
so a quarter of those flights were
 
02:12:58.830 --> 02:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
conducted at nighttime so those are in
 
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
the category of the restrictions U from
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
that first section that we really think
 
02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
are important to have in there um in
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
general uh from threat intelligence
 
02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
perspective we're in all crimes all
 
02:13:12.430 --> 02:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
hazards Center at the New Hampshire
 
02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
information analysis Center so we look
 
02:13:17.790 --> 02:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
at Global Trends Regional Trends uh to
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
see what might be coming and one of the
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
things that's really stood out to us um
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of captured in in some
 
02:13:24.270 --> 02:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
of those uh slides that I believe
 
02:13:26.790 --> 02:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
everyone should have is that information
 
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
sharing tactics techniques and
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
procedures for Bad actors to use
 
02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
commercially available systems and
 
02:13:35.830 --> 02:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
modify them uh that information sharing
 
02:13:37.629 --> 02:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
is is taking place every day on the
 
02:13:39.629 --> 02:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
internet even just the surface internet
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
via message boards um particularly as a
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
result of the Russia uh Ukraine conflict
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's really kind of showcasing how
 
02:13:49.870 --> 02:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
these commercial systems could be used
 
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
to execute a Connecticut attack or to do
 
02:13:54.189 --> 02:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
uh pre-operational surveillance ahead of
 
02:13:56.109 --> 02:13:56.119 align:start position:0%
an attack so we feel like these are
 
02:13:59.310 --> 02:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
really important categories and um
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your your leadership
 
02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
and support of this effort happy to
 
02:14:05.629 --> 02:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might
 
02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
have represent Jam thank you Mr chairman
 
02:14:11.069 --> 02:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
02:14:13.589 --> 02:14:13.599 align:start position:0%
question as somebody that uses these for
 
02:14:15.870 --> 02:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
lawful purposes in my town uh for the
 
02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
police fire Emergency Management
 
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
planning department that sort of thing
 
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we that I saw in
 
02:14:24.270 --> 02:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
your slides was weaponization of the
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
drones and if this amendment that we
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
were talking about was to put back in
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
here uh under the section 107 if you
 
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
were to detect a a drone that was
 
02:14:38.830 --> 02:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
operating in for a nefarious purpose
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
what would your be be your course of
 
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
action so the first course of action and
 
02:14:46.030 --> 02:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of the biggest part
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
of getting this enacted right we would
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
we would contact the local police or us
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
or anybody that has the whatever law
 
02:14:53.709 --> 02:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement has jurisdiction they would
 
02:14:55.549 --> 02:14:55.559 align:start position:0%
have to go there and immediately deal
 
02:14:58.149 --> 02:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
with that um if we have a nefarious or a
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
weaponized drone um our um procedure is
 
02:15:04.589 --> 02:15:04.599 align:start position:0%
that we'll hopefully locate the operator
 
02:15:05.950 --> 02:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
we'll hopefully get that down and then
 
02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to contact our bomb bomb
 
02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
squad to First evaluate that x-ray make
 
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
sure that it is safe for um anybody else
 
02:15:16.149 --> 02:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
to get near it and then we'll obviously
 
02:15:18.669 --> 02:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
um take that in and then um if it's
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
weaponized more often than not we'll
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
probably depending on what kind of
 
02:15:23.109 --> 02:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
weapon it is there's there's all sorts
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
of things that would go into that but we
 
02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
would probably have some of our federal
 
02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
point as a followup um some of those
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
Partners would include FBI
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
ATF and Military depending on what it is
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:42.239 --> 02:15:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
Newman I have a question and I think it
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
has to do with the amendment and it was
 
02:15:50.589 --> 02:15:50.599 align:start position:0%
hard to figure out what was going on
 
02:15:52.030 --> 02:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
with the Amendment because you took
 
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
something out and so it doesn't show in
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
the amendment which you took out but I
 
02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
compare compared it to the original and
 
02:15:59.950 --> 02:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
then compared it to this and it had to
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
do with um it was a violation for first
 
02:16:05.310 --> 02:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
or second offense and it was associated
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
with the Federal Aviation laws or the US
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
laws for that is that the part that may
 
02:16:12.830 --> 02:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
be missing yes representative 100% that
 
02:16:15.069 --> 02:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
that group came together to come up with
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
all of the things that would mirror what
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
we were doing and what we were um what
 
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
we would like to have happen thank
 
02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:24.669 align:start position:0%
we would like to have happen thank
you

02:16:24.669 --> 02:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:16:27.149 --> 02:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
Pratt thanks for answering the question
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
I have a question about uh how does
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
property rights come into play with this
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
I'm property rights if you're using like
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
say night vision at night on your own
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
property how would that play into it if
 
02:16:39.669 --> 02:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
you is it any different on your own
 
02:16:41.709 --> 02:16:41.719 align:start position:0%
property as it would be in the public so
 
02:16:43.469 --> 02:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely so the the the thing
 
02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
about that is we're not asking to
 
02:16:47.549 --> 02:16:47.559 align:start position:0%
regulate any type of airspace so we
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
can't stop somebody from flying their
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
drone over someone else's house or or
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
anything like that um as far as um like
 
02:16:56.669 --> 02:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
peering into Windows or or anything like
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
that which I think kind of where you're
 
02:16:59.709 --> 02:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
going with the question um that would
 
02:17:01.389 --> 02:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
fall under our other Statute in the
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
disorderly conduct statute that 6449 um
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
statute that you you couldn't do that
 
02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
with any kind of
 
02:17:11.190 --> 02:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
device thank you with regard to um
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative M's earlier question uh
 
02:17:15.150 --> 02:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
as far as dropping random stuff on
 
02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
people wouldn't that fall under the uh
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
assault and battery um already or no it
 
02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
could it absolutely could I think
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
anything obviously on prible contact is
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
is simple assault so absolutely it could
 
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
um this just gives us um a better chance
 
02:17:35.150 --> 02:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
to investigate the mechanism in which it
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
was that it was actually being delivered
 
02:17:39.629 --> 02:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
with so that you you can't do that and
 
02:17:41.709 --> 02:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
you can't do that to somebody or or do
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
those um he and representative news was
 
02:17:45.870 --> 02:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
100% correct those horrific acts of
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
dropping feces and urine and other
 
02:17:50.830 --> 02:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
things on individuals yeah oh no I mean
 
02:17:52.669 --> 02:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
you can take it even further at a at a
 
02:17:54.990 --> 02:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
at a wildcat SC some I mean a college
 
02:17:57.070 --> 02:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
event I mean bad things bad things can
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
happen and that's that's part of the
 
02:17:59.790 --> 02:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
critical interest and and we're not
 
02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
going to go through every slide for for
 
02:18:02.990 --> 02:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
you folks but as as you as you look
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
through those it makes this makes a lot
 
02:18:07.549 --> 02:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
of sense okay I can just note very
 
02:18:09.629 --> 02:18:09.639 align:start position:0%
quickly absolutely um so in the category
 
02:18:11.669 --> 02:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
interference of occupied aircraft you'll
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
see an image there um of of an airliner
 
02:18:16.589 --> 02:18:16.599 align:start position:0%
uh coming in on approach in that example
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
there so there's a deterrence aspect um
 
02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
that we think will be very valuable here
 
02:18:23.790 --> 02:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
so that picture was actually posted by a
 
02:18:26.669 --> 02:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
hobbyist uh that was a Frontier Airlines
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh on approach to McCarron airport in
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
Las Vegas had 150 people on board and
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
they posted it to the internet um so
 
02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
even a lot of this this negligent use is
 
02:18:40.750 --> 02:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
is undeterred now to some extent uh and
 
02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
we feel like um this this would help uh
 
02:18:47.589 --> 02:18:47.599 align:start position:0%
to get some of that deterrence in
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
place with regard to the the commercial
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
aircraft there's a height limit a
 
02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
ceiling on the unmanned aircraft but as
 
02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
the as the commercial craft comes in its
 
02:19:03.309 --> 02:19:03.319 align:start position:0%
ceiling goes down how how's that handle
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
certainly so there is a five um nautical
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
mile radius around airports that have um
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
what they call a Bas I'll give it in so
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
concrete airport per se it's a what they
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
call a lance airport so um right here
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
over the state house no one can actually
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
fly their drone it's zero feet um
 
02:19:22.509 --> 02:19:22.519 align:start position:0%
because there's an airport within five
 
02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:24.599 align:start position:0%
nautical miles for that exact reason
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
depending on which Runway they're coming
 
02:19:27.429 --> 02:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
in at conquered airport we could
 
02:19:29.309 --> 02:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely interfere them by flying them
 
02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:31.639 align:start position:0%
so there's waivers and so um things that
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
people under that part 107 um law that
 
02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
they can do they can get waivers we can
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
um uh work with uh we we fly um the
 
02:19:41.230 --> 02:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
state police uses our drone here all the
 
02:19:42.910 --> 02:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
time to help out with um different
 
02:19:43.950 --> 02:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
things that are happening here at the
 
02:19:47.230 --> 02:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
state house all the time um but we have
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
Direct Communications with the Federal
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
Aviation and with conquered Airport to
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's a legal safe thing
 
02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
to do and the same thing goes for over
 
02:19:57.870 --> 02:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
at Manchester um Portsmouth uh Lebanon
 
02:20:00.030 --> 02:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
um we've flown our drones um doing the
 
02:20:02.550 --> 02:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
right way businessman um dot does it all
 
02:20:05.389 --> 02:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
the time flying in the proper we need to
 
02:20:07.710 --> 02:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
negate all those improper uses around
 
02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:08.429 align:start position:0%
negate all those improper uses around
our

02:20:08.429 --> 02:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
airports I guess what I'm asking is for
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
example where I live is next to Bear
 
02:20:15.309 --> 02:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
Brook State Park and it seems to be a a
 
02:20:17.550 --> 02:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
corridor heading into Manchester because
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
I I see them getting lower and lower so
 
02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
how do I know what the CE is above it
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
does it everywhere else it was 400t but
 
02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
is it here less so it's 400t over the
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
highest object so that's a little bit
 
02:20:30.590 --> 02:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
hard to then I got to go to the highest
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
pine tree I see and go 400 feet above
 
02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
that you can only go 4 but if you're
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
over here about 100 yards it's only 400
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
feet above that so it's a it's a little
 
02:20:39.429 --> 02:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
bit confusing but it's 400 feet above
 
02:20:41.469 --> 02:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
that particular thing at no point um
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
over be Brook State Park as any approach
 
02:20:46.510 --> 02:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
into Manchester going to be under 400 ft
 
02:20:47.790 --> 02:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
they're big planes they look pretty
 
02:20:50.190 --> 02:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
close they look really close um
 
02:20:51.630 --> 02:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
represent Newman do you have a question
 
02:20:53.469 --> 02:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
just a comment for the committee the the
 
02:20:55.309 --> 02:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
way the AFA sets it up and I used to
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
work for them is it's a wedding cake
 
02:20:59.950 --> 02:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
upside down wedding cake that goes out
 
02:21:01.790 --> 02:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
and so like he said five miles around
 
02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
you can't do anything and then it might
 
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
go up to like a th000 feet or 2,000 feet
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
and then from there on out right up to
 
02:21:09.910 --> 02:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
and at no point will a drone without a
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
waiver be allowed to fly over 400 feet
 
02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
so you have to do a lot of leg work to
 
02:21:15.469 --> 02:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
get any kind of waiver that allows you
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
to go over that 400t or Beyond visual
 
02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
line of sight or anything that is um a
 
02:21:24.429 --> 02:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
side from that part 107 gotcha thank you
 
02:21:24.439 --> 02:21:25.950 align:start position:0%
side from that part 107 gotcha thank you
represent

02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:21:28.070 --> 02:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:21:31.030 --> 02:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so it's uh kind of
 
02:21:33.630 --> 02:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
a two-parter but um my first question is
 
02:21:36.910 --> 02:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
about um enforceability and kind of
 
02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
like um is it especially when we talk
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
about what are the guidelines right uh a
 
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
certain height uh being within sight and
 
02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
things like that so if someone is not um
 
02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
within sight uh is there a way is there
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
like GPS on it or some way to track I'm
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
just curious and yeah absolutely so
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
there's there's numerous um different um
 
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
there's certain detection devices that
 
02:21:58.429 --> 02:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
are out there that are on the market
 
02:21:59.910 --> 02:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
that um that you can utilize to
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
determine where the operator is how high
 
02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
the um High the um actual uas is um
 
02:22:07.389 --> 02:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
there's certain things that you can just
 
02:22:09.750 --> 02:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
tell that there's an impossibility that
 
02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
someone's able to actually see that
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
drone from x amount of feet by the size
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
of the side there's a lot of different
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
ways that you can go and and do that um
 
02:22:17.710 --> 02:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing is to be able to
 
02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
locate that operator speak with the
 
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
operator and this isn't something that
 
02:22:22.110 --> 02:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
we're trying to go out there and just
 
02:22:23.389 --> 02:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
you know everybody gets a ticket or
 
02:22:24.910 --> 02:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
everybody gets arrested we need
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
something that we can also help educate
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
and our friends at dot are going to we
 
02:22:30.349 --> 02:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
we'll explain that we're going to work
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
on an education piece before it's just
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to go out and
 
02:22:36.309 --> 02:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
arrest or ticket somebody for um we need
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
to have that education campaign we need
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
to have that out there but we need this
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
if there are those egregious um those uh
 
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
egregious situations we're not
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to go out and you know
 
02:22:47.550 --> 02:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
the 14-year-old kid that's you know got
 
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
his drone for Christmas and he flies and
 
02:22:50.750 --> 02:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to go in a you know put him
 
02:22:51.870 --> 02:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
in handcuffs and put him in the back of
 
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
a police car that is not the goal of
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
this thank you you answered my second
 
02:22:55.840 --> 02:22:57.910 align:start position:0%
this thank you you answered my second
question

02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:23:00.910 --> 02:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
anyway these drones now you can actually
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
fly it and see it on your phone but you
 
02:23:06.190 --> 02:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
you might not see the so if you lose
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
sight of the vehicle with your eyes
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of you see it on your phone
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
you you're in violation is that you are
 
02:23:13.710 --> 02:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
you are there are there are there are
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're asking for that um
 
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
that that basically that Global ability
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
to do part 107 because as that Tech
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
technology changes the federal
 
02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
government's going to change those those
 
02:23:24.910 --> 02:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions so we want to make sure New
 
02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is right so that as those
 
02:23:29.870 --> 02:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
Technologies um increase or get better
 
02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
that we're able to follow that along so
 
02:23:33.469 --> 02:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
if we follow that we'll be in great
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
shape so the language that you were
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
looking for would be fluid in other
 
02:23:39.550 --> 02:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
words it's going to empower you to as
 
02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
they progress not just as they are
 
02:23:43.630 --> 02:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
Frozen in Time 100% and that's exactly
 
02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:45.160 align:start position:0%
what we want to be able to do because
 
02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's not right to anybody if we don't
 
02:23:49.070 --> 02:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
change with times and for
 
02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
clarification everything that's illegal
 
02:23:55.110 --> 02:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
under those cfrs now whether or not you
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
can enforce them are still illegal just
 
02:23:58.710 --> 02:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
because in other words the federal
 
02:24:00.030 --> 02:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
government could come in and enforce
 
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
them you're a force multiplier by
 
02:24:04.349 --> 02:24:04.359 align:start position:0%
allowing you to do it as well is that
 
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
correct 100% an analogy that I would use
 
02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
would be um actually to back to the
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
first hearing what uh attorney Moses was
 
02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
talking about when it comes to CDL or F
 
02:24:14.150 --> 02:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
Federal Motor Carrier it's the same
 
02:24:16.510 --> 02:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
thing we adopted those 49 cfrs to be
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
able to go out there and enforce those
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicle statutes we that in
 
02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and all that fine money
 
02:24:24.070 --> 02:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so forth comes to New Hampshire
 
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
instead of going to the federal
 
02:24:27.389 --> 02:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
government because we the state police
 
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
or whatever um they enforce that and
 
02:24:35.469 --> 02:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire see no further questions I
 
02:24:41.790 --> 02:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
don't think good thank you thank
 
02:24:49.150 --> 02:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
Co than than you
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
sir so the part of the issue with the
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
reason sorry we don't know this for fact
 
02:25:02.830 --> 02:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
but uh it is our opinion and our belief
 
02:25:04.349 --> 02:25:04.359 align:start position:0%
that could you introduce yourself oh I
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
apologize that's s right my name is
 
02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
David kovar uh private sector resident
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
of EX New Hampshire um I run a small
 
02:25:14.830 --> 02:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
high-tech company called uro um and the
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
report that um Adam mentioned where the
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
fa had the report with all statistics um
 
02:25:23.269 --> 02:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
I actually built the platform that the
 
02:25:26.349 --> 02:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
FAA used for Gathering the data and
 
02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
Performing that analysis so that was
 
02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
under an FAA contract so we've worked
 
02:25:33.070 --> 02:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
with the FAA on a professional basis in
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to gather data to help
 
02:25:39.870 --> 02:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
educate legislators public and things
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
like that on what is and is not going on
 
02:25:44.269 --> 02:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
in the airspace part of the problem that
 
02:25:46.750 --> 02:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen um and I think we've observed
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
it here in New Hampshire as well is that
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
what humans perceive at drone is or is
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
not doing may not be what the Drone is
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
or is not doing and so that's part of
 
02:25:56.429 --> 02:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
the work that my company has been
 
02:25:59.910 --> 02:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
performing um I am a private sector um U
 
02:26:01.910 --> 02:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
member of the working group that Adam
 
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned so that's the counter uas
 
02:26:07.389 --> 02:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
working group counter uas uh it's it
 
02:26:10.030 --> 02:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
technically means counter drone but it's
 
02:26:12.269 --> 02:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
very important I think for all of us to
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
remember that when we want to counter a
 
02:26:17.469 --> 02:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
drone what we're really talking about is
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
finding ways to prevent that drone from
 
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
doing something something that is not
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing unfortunately in
 
02:26:26.190 --> 02:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
the military context and what we see in
 
02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
going on in Ukraine counter drone means
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
shooting it down but what Chris was
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
talking about Lieutenant storm was
 
02:26:33.870 --> 02:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
talking about is that really what we
 
02:26:36.110 --> 02:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
want to do is go educate the public if
 
02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
we can educate the public so that they
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
don't launch that drone in the first
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
place we've countered that drone and
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's the optimum thing um failing to
 
02:26:48.830 --> 02:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
do that if we if they launch a drone and
 
02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
we are able to identify where where the
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
operator is and to go have a
 
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
conversation with that operator and have
 
02:26:57.550 --> 02:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
that operator land the the Drone and say
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
okay I understand I was not doing
 
02:27:01.150 --> 02:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
something appropriate I'll never do this
 
02:27:04.349 --> 02:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
again we've again countered the Drone
 
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
without charging them with anything
 
02:27:08.269 --> 02:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
without shooting anything down without
 
02:27:11.550 --> 02:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
any sort of adversarial relationship and
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
really that's ultimately what the
 
02:27:15.870 --> 02:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
community is most interested in in terms
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
of what we call counter uas so that was
 
02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
a long-winded way of saying I've been
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
part of that ation in the state of New
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:27.950 --> 02:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
now and did you have anything else you
 
02:27:30.750 --> 02:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to add about the absolutely so
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's a Association uh the association
 
02:27:36.830 --> 02:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
of enrud Vehicle Systems International
 
02:27:40.190 --> 02:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
is uh known as a auvsi uh they are an
 
02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
advocacy group that's been around for a
 
02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
number of years now um they and I don't
 
02:27:47.950 --> 02:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
have the date in front of me I apologize
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
sent a letter uh which
 
02:27:52.429 --> 02:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
out to their entire membership saying
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
that they had filed opposition
 
02:27:57.990 --> 02:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
testimony uh with respect to this
 
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and that I found out about
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
that on Sunday I called Lieutenant storm
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
we both talked about it I then called
 
02:28:09.510 --> 02:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
auvsi membership U sorry Representatives
 
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
during that Monday through Wednesday to
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
figure out what exactly was going on and
 
02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
I explained to them what I think has
 
02:28:18.110 --> 02:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
been explained to all of you we've put a
 
02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
lot of time and effort into terms of
 
02:28:22.269 --> 02:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
craft in this legislation we have talked
 
02:28:24.190 --> 02:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
to the FAA we've talked to FBI we've
 
02:28:26.429 --> 02:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
talked to Bureau the New Hampshire
 
02:28:28.349 --> 02:28:28.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation there are a
 
02:28:29.950 --> 02:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
lot of people that we've worked very
 
02:28:33.309 --> 02:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
carefully with to ensure that the
 
02:28:36.150 --> 02:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation will stand the test
 
02:28:38.190 --> 02:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
of time and the test of the FAA and
 
02:28:40.510 --> 02:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
things like that there's a long history
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
of towns and states and other entities
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
trying to pass laws about drone activity
 
02:28:49.389 --> 02:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
that essentially stepped on the faa's
 
02:28:53.230 --> 02:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
toes and the way that usually happens is
 
02:28:55.389 --> 02:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
if you say we are going to charge
 
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
somebody with flying a drone over a
 
02:29:00.030 --> 02:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
particular place that's the FAA sole
 
02:29:01.950 --> 02:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
purview they don't no one else has the
 
02:29:04.510 --> 02:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
ability to say where you can or cannot
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
operate in the skies above us so if you
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
start stepping on their toes in that
 
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
manner then you start getting into an
 
02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
area of preemption so this law this this
 
02:29:17.070 --> 02:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
legislation was particularly crafted to
 
02:29:20.550 --> 02:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
not do that what the auvsi letter said
 
02:29:23.309 --> 02:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
is that we were potentially going to
 
02:29:26.670 --> 02:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
step on areas of FAA preemption and so
 
02:29:29.469 --> 02:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
let me emphasize two things one is we
 
02:29:32.590 --> 02:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
were very very careful not to any way
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
shape or form get on uh to potentially
 
02:29:38.670 --> 02:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
raise the faa's attention in terms of
 
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
preemption the other one is that they
 
02:29:43.389 --> 02:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
didn't say here are examples of how that
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
will happen it was this very vague
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
possibility um and there's a lot of sort
 
02:29:50.349 --> 02:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
of supposition and backstory about why
 
02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
they did that um but the sort of
 
02:29:55.230 --> 02:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
ultimate answer or ultimate outcome of
 
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
all that is they went very very silent
 
02:30:00.269 --> 02:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
and so they have not follow up on that
 
02:30:01.950 --> 02:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
they're not here to testify about that
 
02:30:04.429 --> 02:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
opinion and ultimately the FAA has not
 
02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
either representative Jam thank you Mr
 
02:30:14.590 --> 02:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
question um in one of the towns adjacent
 
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
to mine we have a model aircraft Club
 
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
they don't fly drones but they fly model
 
02:30:26.110 --> 02:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
aircraft um and line of sight all the
 
02:30:28.630 --> 02:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
time um and some of them are amate radio
 
02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
operators that use them to go long
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
distances this would also apply to those
 
02:30:38.469 --> 02:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
people as well so I will defer to Bureau
 
02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics for the exact specifics but
 
02:30:41.790 --> 02:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
the answer is essentially to my
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge no so I'm actually I FL I have
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
flown uh fixed Wing model aircraft uh
 
02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
well before drones existed I'm a hammer
 
02:30:52.630 --> 02:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
radio operator um and so one of the
 
02:30:55.150 --> 02:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
things I will say about that Community
 
02:30:56.910 --> 02:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
is that they tend to be very compliant
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
they understand exactly the the sort of
 
02:31:01.790 --> 02:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
boundaries within with within which they
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
operate and they are exactly the sort of
 
02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
community that we want to support we
 
02:31:09.309 --> 02:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
want to do everything in our possible to
 
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
support those hobbyists and those
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
commercial activities and part of the
 
02:31:17.070 --> 02:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
effort and this is a national effort but
 
02:31:19.269 --> 02:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
specifically as represented in this
 
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
proposed legis ation is that if we can
 
02:31:25.630 --> 02:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
help get what we call the clueless
 
02:31:27.710 --> 02:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
careless and criminal out of the air if
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
we can start reducing the number of
 
02:31:32.309 --> 02:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
those sorts of incidents then there will
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
be less sort of public push back on
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
drones in general and so if we can get
 
02:31:40.190 --> 02:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation through and we can
 
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
start um having conversations with
 
02:31:45.230 --> 02:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
people and if necessary charging them
 
02:31:48.030 --> 02:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
for this inappropriate or criminal
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
activity then other people see that the
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is supporting the
 
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
people such as you're talking about
 
02:31:57.630 --> 02:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
while trying to ensure that the people
 
02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
are not operating safely are dealt with
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
appropriately and so that way the public
 
02:32:06.710 --> 02:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
perception is that the people who are
 
02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
flying are flying for hobby purposes or
 
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
good commercial purposes and that the
 
02:32:13.630 --> 02:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
people that are flying inappropriately
 
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
or criminally are being dealt with
 
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
appropriately within the proper bounds
 
02:32:24.030 --> 02:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:24.040 --> 02:32:25.630 align:start position:0%
 
represent

02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:32:28.510 --> 02:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
saitech what's the definition of a drone
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
versus a fixed Wing model plane don't
 
02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't the fixed Wing model I'm
 
02:32:35.950 --> 02:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
leading to this wouldn't the fixed Wing
 
02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
model plane fall under the definition of
 
02:32:42.269 --> 02:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
a drone yes um so it gets a little bit
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
nuanced in here but uh essentially all
 
02:32:46.429 --> 02:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
of those model aircraft that I fly and
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
the people are flying now are
 
02:32:50.429 --> 02:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
essentially drones so they're drones is
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
a shorthand for unmanned aerial vehicle
 
02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
or actually technically un cruded AAL
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle now and so those model fix wings
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh helicopters and what we call now mod
 
02:33:03.230 --> 02:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh multi-rotors or quads all fall under
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
the same uh
 
02:33:08.510 --> 02:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
definition to dig in a little bit more
 
02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
those model airplane clubs are um are
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
also specifically covered under the FAA
 
02:33:15.070 --> 02:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations in terms of what
 
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
can or cannot be flown when and where
 
02:33:19.309 --> 02:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
let me just emphasize again that we are
 
02:33:23.150 --> 02:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
not proposing to enforce the FAA
 
02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
regulations about what can or cannot fly
 
02:33:28.110 --> 02:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
in the airspace we are that is strictly
 
02:33:33.269 --> 02:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
FAA see no further questions thank you
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
much the chair calls Trisha Lambert and
 
02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:48.710 align:start position:0%
much the chair calls Trisha Lambert and
Jason

02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
levit

02:33:51.590 --> 02:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
levit
 
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman and members of the
 
02:33:54.910 --> 02:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Trisha Lambert and
 
02:33:56.910 --> 02:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
I am the administrator for the New
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Transportation
 
02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
Bureau of
 
02:34:01.269 --> 02:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics let you introduce and then
 
02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
I'll go after you good afternoon my name
 
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
is Jason levit I'm the uas planner for
 
02:34:09.150 --> 02:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics so I thought I'd just give a
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
little bit of background on who we are
 
02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
and our role um for those that don't
 
02:34:20.590 --> 02:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
know we're we are the um under RSA 422
 
02:34:22.349 --> 02:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
we are the regulatory Agency for all
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
things aviation in the state um one of
 
02:34:27.070 --> 02:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
the U main things we do is we are the
 
02:34:29.550 --> 02:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
liaison to the Federal Aviation
 
02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:31.590 align:start position:0%
liaison to the Federal Aviation
Administration

02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
um we also are a promote we also um are
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
by Statute supposed to promote all
 
02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
things Aviation so I think that our role
 
02:34:43.630 --> 02:34:43.640 align:start position:0%
here as we're talking about
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
um um trying to make penalties for FL
 
02:34:48.830 --> 02:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
people who do bad things with with uas
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
or drones
 
02:34:51.710 --> 02:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to be really
 
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
transparent is that our one of our jobs
 
02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
is to make is to make Aviation
 
02:34:58.950 --> 02:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
accessible to everybody um and do that
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire working
 
02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
with the FAA so I our role as part of
 
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
the committee that was mentioned several
 
02:35:09.309 --> 02:35:09.319 align:start position:0%
times was um just that I have been here
 
02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
for probably the last eight years or so
 
02:35:14.830 --> 02:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
for many different uas bills and most of
 
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
them were here for preemption issues we
 
02:35:20.710 --> 02:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much every time it was either the
 
02:35:23.790 --> 02:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
wrong definition um we we spent a lot of
 
02:35:26.269 --> 02:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
time trying to get things straight as it
 
02:35:29.750 --> 02:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
would relate back to the FAA um so
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
instead of waiting for another bill to
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
come forward we decided to get together
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
and to try to put something forward that
 
02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
would help um the the law enforcement
 
02:35:42.190 --> 02:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
agencies of the state um while still
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
trying to promote and educate people
 
02:35:46.510 --> 02:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
that to fly safely their drone in the
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
state um so
 
02:35:52.950 --> 02:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
where we're at with it is that as it
 
02:35:56.190 --> 02:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
sits right now we are unable to support
 
02:35:58.950 --> 02:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation as written um we are
 
02:36:01.389 --> 02:36:01.399 align:start position:0%
very much um in support of going back to
 
02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
look at the additional the language that
 
02:36:06.510 --> 02:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
was put forward um to us a committee um
 
02:36:08.429 --> 02:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee if that's the will of
 
02:36:10.110 --> 02:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
this committee to put together to work
 
02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
thought I guess I'll I'll leave it there
 
02:36:20.269 --> 02:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
because a lot of things were already
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
said and I don't I don't want to um I
 
02:36:24.429 --> 02:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
just I just wanted to be really clear
 
02:36:26.750 --> 02:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we we are here to promote Aviation
 
02:36:29.429 --> 02:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
and drones are very much that and um we
 
02:36:31.389 --> 02:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
certainly use it within the department
 
02:36:34.510 --> 02:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
for a lot of great things um in in
 
02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
analyzing our infrastructure and um you
 
02:36:40.030 --> 02:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
know just having that that view traffic
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
those types of things so I guess did you
 
02:36:45.150 --> 02:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
want to add anything I guess we'll take
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them well I guess
 
02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
my first question would be what is it
 
02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:57.309 --> 02:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
bill so well as written there was one
 
02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
piece when we were at the Senate um that
 
02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you this is a really good question
 
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
um it does not cross over into
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
422 um I had requested that um because
 
02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
it's in the criminal statute currently
 
02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
um their Aviation folks don't know where
 
02:37:17.349 --> 02:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
to look in the criminal code they're
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to look to 422 and it currently
 
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
does not have that so that's that's our
 
02:37:25.870 --> 02:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
reason why um plus I I feel like the
 
02:37:27.910 --> 02:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
spirit of the bill when put forward was
 
02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
not what we were willing to accept
 
02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
except it paralleled the FAA which it
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:42.030 --> 02:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
now further questions representative um
 
02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
harri gather thank you Mr thank you Mr
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
chair so are the piece that's missing
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
that they talked about earlier is that
 
02:37:50.950 --> 02:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
the piece that you're referring to
 
02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
there's actually two pieces um the first
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
piece is
 
02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
um in the original Bill correct correct
 
02:38:03.070 --> 02:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
the first piece was was um originally um
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
relating to the violation of the first
 
02:38:07.469 --> 02:38:07.479 align:start position:0%
offense and the misdemeanor for a second
 
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
and subsequent offense um if such person
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
operates a small unmanned aircraft uas
 
02:38:15.070 --> 02:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
in violation of the laws and regulations
 
02:38:16.750 --> 02:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
of the Federal Aviation
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
Administration um or other agencies
 
02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
other agency that governs
 
02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics and the second piece you do
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
not have in front of you is um where you
 
02:38:29.269 --> 02:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
would there would be a section put into
 
02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
the RSA
 
02:38:34.190 --> 02:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
422 that crosses back over to to show
 
02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
them where the
 
02:38:38.269 --> 02:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
penalties um and violations would be in
 
02:38:43.309 --> 02:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%

position of the FAA or is this no it is
 
02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:10.160 align:start position:0%

things in it what was your position on
 
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:30.240 align:start position:0%

amendment for the second piece which
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%

chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
question um the crossover to RSA for
 
02:39:54.349 --> 02:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
22 um the question is this um this is a
 
02:39:56.469 --> 02:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
new section what I'm seeing before me as
 
02:39:59.670 --> 02:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate and it talks about
 
02:40:02.349 --> 02:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
uas but it doesn't have a definition so
 
02:40:03.469 --> 02:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of times when we have a new
 
02:40:05.110 --> 02:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
section of law we have definitions that
 
02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
are used in that section would be
 
02:40:09.269 --> 02:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
defined are they defined in
 
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
422 yes sir they are um thank you for
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
that question um
 
02:40:18.670 --> 02:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
we actually made we entered the
 
02:40:20.750 --> 02:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
definition of the uas to parallel the
 
02:40:23.150 --> 02:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
Federal Aviation Administration um
 
02:40:26.429 --> 02:40:26.439 align:start position:0%
several sessions ago um that so that way
 
02:40:27.950 --> 02:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
new bills that would come up like this
 
02:40:34.750 --> 02:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.910 --> 02:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
definitions okay thank you no further
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
questions um I'm going what I'm going to
 
02:40:41.469 --> 02:40:41.479 align:start position:0%
do is I'm going to appoint a um what I'm
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to call a mini subcommittee and

dissemination of synthetic s uh sexual
 
02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
images um this legislation broadens the
 
02:43:44.790 --> 02:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
scope of RSA 644 col 9A New Hampshire
 
02:43:46.110 --> 02:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
statute that addresses the

a crime in our state this bill could not
 
02:44:10.030 --> 02:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
come at a more urgent time when
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
advancements and Technology are
 
02:44:15.309 --> 02:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
developing at a rapid Pace it's alarming

to know that everyday people are having
 
02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
their images inappropriate rely used to
 
02:44:23.630 --> 02:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
create false representations are also
 
02:44:26.510 --> 02:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
known as deep fakes of themselves
 
02:44:29.469 --> 02:44:29.479 align:start position:0%
conducting demeaning sexual
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%

intelligence to take a victim's face and
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
Transplant it onto a sexually explicit
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
video or image this is made all the more
 
02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
easier with the creation of new apps and
 
02:44:47.429 --> 02:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
websites as technological advancement
 
02:44:51.469 --> 02:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
allow for more for new ways to exploit
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
people and make these horrific images
 
02:44:58.110 --> 02:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
millions of New U new deep fake uh
 
02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
exists online and are nearly always
 
02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
posted without the victim's
 
02:45:06.910 --> 02:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
consent these synthetic images are used
 
02:45:09.309 --> 02:45:09.319 align:start position:0%

loss due to this uh undue violation of
 
02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
privacy Senate Bill 464 is consistent
 
02:45:40.110 --> 02:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
with our other efforts our state has
 
02:45:42.269 --> 02:45:42.279 align:start position:0%
taken to protect victims against
 
02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
exploitation and sexual violence this is
 
02:45:48.469 --> 02:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
the right time to pass this legislation
 
02:45:50.910 --> 02:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
and protect people from being victimized
 
02:45:53.309 --> 02:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
in such a disgusting way I hope you
 
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
would consider passing this important

02:46:58.030 --> 02:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Eric Kinsman
 
02:46:59.309 --> 02:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
I'm a lieutenant with the Portsmouth
 
02:47:00.510 --> 02:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
Police Department and the current
 
02:47:01.830 --> 02:47:01.840 align:start position:0%

crimes against children task force
 
02:47:07.349 --> 02:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
current language in RSA 644 col 9-a
 
02:47:09.230 --> 02:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
restricts iak investigators from
 
02:47:10.630 --> 02:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
effectively investigating and
 
02:47:13.070 --> 02:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting an individual who violates
 
02:47:15.150 --> 02:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
the statute because of how the material
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
might be disseminated or whether the
 
02:47:20.110 --> 02:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
material is quote an actual person or
 
02:47:22.830 --> 02:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
digitally synthetic material today much
 
02:47:24.150 --> 02:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
of the information in the world to
 
02:47:25.710 --> 02:47:25.720 align:start position:0%
include photographs movies and other
 
02:47:27.710 --> 02:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
media has transferred digitally from one
 
02:47:30.269 --> 02:47:30.279 align:start position:0%
person to another expanding the language
 
02:47:32.590 --> 02:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
defining how material is disseminated as
 
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
written in in s SP 464 will allow law
 
02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement to work to protect the
 
02:47:40.349 --> 02:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
victims when that material is illegally
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
disseminated electronically or shared on
 
02:47:46.349 --> 02:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
social media like so often we see now
 
02:47:48.190 --> 02:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
when it comes to artificial intelligence
 
02:47:50.349 --> 02:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
AI gener generated models rely on
 
02:47:52.670 --> 02:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
popular open- Source databases of images
 
02:47:54.429 --> 02:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
to create what is being described as
 
02:47:57.309 --> 02:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
hyperrealistic photos these databases
 
02:47:59.349 --> 02:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
contain billions and billions of images
 
02:48:01.870 --> 02:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
taken from the internet and mimic visual
 
02:48:04.469 --> 02:48:04.479 align:start position:0%
patterns to create new photos these
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
photos literally are virtually
 
02:48:08.269 --> 02:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable from those which are
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
genuine while these digital IM while
 
02:48:12.870 --> 02:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
these digital synthetic images may not
 
02:48:15.070 --> 02:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
be an actual person they may be
 
02:48:17.469 --> 02:48:17.479 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable from a p from pictures
 
02:48:20.030 --> 02:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
of an actual person and therefore create
 
02:48:22.670 --> 02:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
a situation in which an actual person is
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
victimized New Hampshire iak supports
 
02:48:27.230 --> 02:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
s464 and believes it will take an
 
02:48:28.670 --> 02:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
important step in continuing the
 
02:48:31.030 --> 02:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
protection of child victims as well
 
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:34.920 align:start position:0%

02:48:55.710 --> 02:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh Mr chair members of
 
02:48:57.910 --> 02:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
the committee um my name is Pamela kyg
 
02:48:59.710 --> 02:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm the public policy specialist at
 
02:49:01.349 --> 02:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Coalition against
 
02:49:04.269 --> 02:49:04.279 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence um I'm here
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
to speak in support of SB 464 I'll keep
 
02:49:09.750 --> 02:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
it really brief um we also were in
 
02:49:12.750 --> 02:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
support of HB 1319 which already passed
 
02:49:15.190 --> 02:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
this body and I just wanted to emphasize
 
02:49:17.150 --> 02:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
how grateful we are for the sponsors for
 
02:49:19.309 --> 02:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
bringing forward this proactive uh
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that addresses this really
 
02:49:23.670 --> 02:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
critical issue um this is a specific
 
02:49:25.990 --> 02:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
form of abuse um that will only increase
 
02:49:28.990 --> 02:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
if we're not proactive um and take steps
 
02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that the appropriate
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
consequences are in place um and we know
 
02:49:35.469 --> 02:49:35.479 align:start position:0%
that nearly all deep fake content is
 
02:49:37.830 --> 02:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
non-consensual and is a form of sexual
 
02:49:40.309 --> 02:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
exploitation um and so it's also a
 
02:49:42.349 --> 02:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
really egregious privacy violation which
 
02:49:44.349 --> 02:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
is something that we as a state um have
 
02:49:46.429 --> 02:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
worked really hard to address uh
 
02:49:49.550 --> 02:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
personal privacy issues um and we also
 
02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
have worked really hard um especially in
 
02:49:54.229 --> 02:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
recent years um to take every
 
02:49:56.550 --> 02:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address different forms
 
02:49:59.389 --> 02:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
of sexual exploitation and abuse so um
 
02:50:00.950 --> 02:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
on those principles we are just really
 
02:50:02.790 --> 02:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
grateful to see this move forward uh
 
02:50:07.070 --> 02:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:17.630 --> 02:50:17.640 align:start position:0%

02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:24.269 --> 02:50:24.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Stephen Andrew I'm an
 
02:50:26.710 --> 02:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
assistant County attorney with the marac
 
02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office I've been a
 
02:50:31.070 --> 02:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for over 20 years uh again
 
02:50:32.510 --> 02:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
maram my county attorney's office
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
supports this legislation it's identical
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
to the house Bill 1319 so I'll say The
 
02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
Identical thing which is essentially
 
02:50:41.630 --> 02:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately as technology
 
02:50:43.790 --> 02:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
advances people use that technology to
 
02:50:47.309 --> 02:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
exploit others until the law catches up
 
02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
this is an ability this is a a bill that
 
02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
proactively addresses that and be happy
 
02:50:55.950 --> 02:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:03.870 --> 02:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:20.110 align:start position:0%
 
Police

02:51:20.110 --> 02:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
Police
 
02:51:20.120 --> 02:51:20.910 align:start position:0%
Police
go

02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
ahead good afternoon Mr chair members of
 
02:51:25.870 --> 02:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
the committee uh as well as the other
 
02:51:27.389 --> 02:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
three individuals that have spoken
 
02:51:28.910 --> 02:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
before me New Hampshire State Police is
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
also in support of this bill as we
 
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
werehouse Bill
 
02:51:34.389 --> 02:51:34.399 align:start position:0%
1319 um my name is Lieutenant Tamar
 
02:51:37.870 --> 02:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
Hester and I am a lieutenant in charge
 
02:51:39.550 --> 02:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
of the special investigations unit in
 
02:51:41.229 --> 02:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State Police we also
 
02:51:44.429 --> 02:51:44.439 align:start position:0%
work very closely with the iak so this
 
02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
Pro this proposed bill will amend and
 
02:51:48.750 --> 02:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
expand the scope of the current statute
 
02:51:50.030 --> 02:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
which will give law enforcement the
 
02:51:51.990 --> 02:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
clear ability to enforce the sharing of
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
material in an online platform it's no
 
02:51:55.950 --> 02:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
longer necessary to connect with
 
02:51:58.030 --> 02:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
individuals in person in order to share
 
02:51:59.950 --> 02:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
material it's as simple as a click of a
 
02:52:01.830 --> 02:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
button to generate as well as share an
 
02:52:04.269 --> 02:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
image across multiple platforms and from
 
02:52:06.110 --> 02:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
there the image can be circulated around
 
02:52:08.429 --> 02:52:08.439 align:start position:0%
the world with the advancement of the
 
02:52:10.190 --> 02:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
digital age it created new forms of
 
02:52:12.389 --> 02:52:12.399 align:start position:0%
harassment and cyber bullying since the
 
02:52:14.190 --> 02:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
statute was enacted technology has
 
02:52:15.870 --> 02:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
involved and currently there are
 
02:52:17.630 --> 02:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
numerous software programs available
 
02:52:19.269 --> 02:52:19.279 align:start position:0%
that can generate real realistic images
 
02:52:20.550 --> 02:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
or videos that are virtually
 
02:52:23.389 --> 02:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
indistinguishable from a real person
 
02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
there have been many instances across
 
02:52:26.990 --> 02:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
the country of individuals utilizing
 
02:52:28.990 --> 02:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence to create fake
 
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
pornographic images and share them
 
02:52:33.070 --> 02:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
across multiple social media platforms
 
02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
many of them in a fashion as which is
 
02:52:36.190 --> 02:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
considered revenge
 
02:52:38.429 --> 02:52:38.439 align:start position:0%
porn the sharing of an image that is
 
02:52:40.110 --> 02:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
nearly indistinguishable from a real
 
02:52:41.950 --> 02:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
person and shares the characteristics of
 
02:52:43.590 --> 02:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
that real person can have a crippling
 
02:52:45.790 --> 02:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
effect on that individual's life and
 
02:52:48.190 --> 02:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
create a lasting stigma it is as it is
 
02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
very difficult if not nearly impossible
 
02:52:52.229 --> 02:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
to completely remove something from the
 
02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
internet once it's been
 
02:52:55.870 --> 02:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
distributed defendants are sometimes
 
02:52:57.910 --> 02:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
able to avoid being criminally charged
 
02:53:00.030 --> 02:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
by taking images of real individuals and
 
02:53:01.990 --> 02:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
altering them in a computer generated
 
02:53:03.750 --> 02:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
fashion to which it's no longer real
 
02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
person and this statute will change that
 
02:53:08.349 --> 02:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
this additional language will support
 
02:53:10.229 --> 02:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
evolving technology and the ability for
 
02:53:11.950 --> 02:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
individuals to quickly and easily

executive session on Senate Bill two

will fill the Gap that they're they're
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
feeling is an issue when it comes to

security clearances and evaluating who

04:01:23.870 --> 04:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
think we should assist them in uh making
 
04:01:24.790 --> 04:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
it more
 
04:01:26.830 --> 04:01:26.840 align:start position:0%

folks in the state need this so that
 
04:01:39.550 --> 04:01:39.560 align:start position:0%

trying to get records
 
04:01:47.990 --> 04:01:48.000 align:start position:0%

study can I get a second second second
 
04:03:13.269 --> 04:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
by representative appr would you like to
 
04:03:15.790 --> 04:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
speak to your second excuse me at
 
04:03:20.149 --> 04:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
first sure um there was uh several bills
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
that we heard that day a lot of them
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
kind of go around around and and touch
 
04:03:27.590 --> 04:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
on the same subject um this particular
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
Bill if you look at line 19 on the first
 
04:03:33.429 --> 04:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
page it talks about um quantity of five
 
04:03:35.670 --> 04:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
grams or more including alternates and a
 
04:03:38.790 --> 04:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
bunch of other words and it there is a
 
04:03:40.349 --> 04:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
bill that is being heard in the Senate
 
04:03:42.670 --> 04:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
right now that has a a higher amount
 
04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
than that so
 
04:03:45.990 --> 04:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
the thought was to interim study this
 
04:03:48.110 --> 04:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
one and wait and see where it goes and
 
04:03:49.349 --> 04:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
if we have to we can do something with
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
it over the
 
04:03:52.750 --> 04:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
summer would you like to speak to your
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
second I'm in agreement uh with the uh
 
04:03:58.189 --> 04:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill uh watching that and see
 
04:04:00.830 --> 04:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
what happens and we'll have this as
 
04:04:04.149 --> 04:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
backup further
 
04:04:06.590 --> 04:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I ask clerk to
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
call the RO motion Mr chair oh I'm sorry
 
04:04:11.429 --> 04:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative Muse yeah I I did I
 
04:04:14.750 --> 04:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
did want to I I did want to note that um
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we didn't hear in
 
04:04:20.469 --> 04:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
the testimony for this bill is that um
 
04:04:23.469 --> 04:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
the there doesn't seem to be much
 
04:04:26.149 --> 04:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
evidence that mandatory minimums of any
 
04:04:30.870 --> 04:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
kind um really impact this this type of
 
04:04:36.790 --> 04:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
behavior they feel good to do um uh but
 
04:04:38.950 --> 04:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh I think that there's evidence that
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
shows they're not particularly
 
04:04:42.110 --> 04:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
costeffective especially when you
 
04:04:46.110 --> 04:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
consider that we can investing um uh in
 
04:04:49.469 --> 04:04:49.479 align:start position:0%
actually helping law enforcement um uh
 
04:04:51.469 --> 04:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
better enforce our existing laws you
 
04:04:53.309 --> 04:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
know when it comes to to drugs as
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to incarcerating people um uh
 
04:04:59.469 --> 04:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
for longer times our penalties in New
 
04:05:02.189 --> 04:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are are quite severe for these
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
types of drug offenses so I I just
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to note that um that the uh the
 
04:05:11.910 --> 04:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
idea of uh pushing this bill to interim
 
04:05:14.830 --> 04:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
study isn't necessarily so we can pass
 
04:05:18.110 --> 04:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
another bill uh with the same
 
04:05:22.630 --> 04:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
issues thank you um further discussion
 
04:05:24.030 --> 04:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
see none that asked the cl to call the
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
role motion to floor is interim study
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%

04:06:57.389 --> 04:06:57.399 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 414 and I
 
04:06:59.429 --> 04:06:59.439 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Stone to make a
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair I'd make a
 
04:07:04.830 --> 04:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
motion on to pass SB
 
04:07:07.550 --> 04:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
414 second seconded by representative
 
04:07:08.670 --> 04:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
roads would you like to speak to your
 
04:07:11.149 --> 04:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
motion uh Mr chair I would I think we've
 
04:07:12.790 --> 04:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
heard enough in this committee on the
 
04:07:15.309 --> 04:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
dangers in the uh life or death
 
04:07:17.830 --> 04:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
situations occurring from fentanyl use
 
04:07:19.710 --> 04:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a prudent thing to do
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
to have enhanced penalties for fentanyl
 
04:07:23.309 --> 04:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
especially with death resulting in the
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
state we need to send a message that
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be tolerating uh the
 
04:07:29.309 --> 04:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
drug dealing with involving fentanyl on
 
04:07:31.109 --> 04:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
any level and I think this sends a good
 
04:07:32.309 --> 04:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
message to
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
everyone thank you um representative bro
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
you like to speak a
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:45.229 --> 04:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
discussion represented
 
04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
Balden is anyone on the committee aware
 
04:07:50.269 --> 04:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
of the penalty for penal possession how
 
04:07:52.830 --> 04:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:56.950 --> 04:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
compare stand by you have the bill do
 
04:08:12.429 --> 04:08:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:12.439 --> 04:08:15.109 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:08:15.109 --> 04:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
so this is um with regard to if somebody
 
04:08:22.510 --> 04:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
dies as a result of the dealing so this
 
04:08:26.189 --> 04:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
is a minimum of 10 and up to life so
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's significantly stiffer than the
 
04:08:30.590 --> 04:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
penalty for possession of Fenton itself
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
I believe it looks just a quick Google
 
04:08:34.510 --> 04:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's three and a half to
 
04:08:38.229 --> 04:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
seven years for possession I I guess I'm
 
04:08:41.109 --> 04:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
just curious about that because I
 
04:08:43.950 --> 04:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
question how many years someone needs to
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
face for their behavior to be changed
 
04:08:47.469 --> 04:08:47.479 align:start position:0%
and whether or not there may be only
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences where we just
 
04:08:51.109 --> 04:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
have people not calling 911 and cleaning
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
the scene as was
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
seen before New Hampshire started making
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
changes um I you know it's I just don't
 
04:09:02.510 --> 04:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
know who's going to be arrested if no
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
one calls 911 and only a dead body is
 
04:09:09.429 --> 04:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
found I'm not sure who we'd be punishing
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:12.359 --> 04:09:14.149 align:start position:0%
 
victim

04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
victim
 
04:09:16.990 --> 04:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent wheeler
 
04:09:19.389 --> 04:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I voted against
 
04:09:21.750 --> 04:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
inm study on the last one I'll vote
 
04:09:23.950 --> 04:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
against the these mandatory minimum
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
bills very simply put because I believe
 
04:09:28.510 --> 04:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
in judicial discretion I believe that
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
the judges don't and wouldn't
 
04:09:33.269 --> 04:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily appreciate the legislature
 
04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
telling them uh that we know better on
 
04:09:38.149 --> 04:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
these issues and I think that when it
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
comes to their discretion to see a
 
04:09:44.910 --> 04:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
person some people deserve High
 
04:09:46.630 --> 04:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
sentences I think the Judge can
 
04:09:48.189 --> 04:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not they do some
 
04:09:50.910 --> 04:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
people might not uh and and I I like the
 
04:09:53.189 --> 04:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
idea of leaving it up to the Judiciary
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
and I think the New Hampshire Judiciary
 
04:09:57.389 --> 04:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
does a good job uh there so I'll be
 
04:09:59.389 --> 04:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
voting against the a to pass motion and
 
04:10:02.109 --> 04:10:02.119 align:start position:0%
I appreciate uh you letting me speak
 
04:10:03.630 --> 04:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
04:10:03.640 --> 04:10:06.070 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
representative

04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:08.790 --> 04:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
Muse I I do want to point out that under
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
our current law a judge has the
 
04:11:13.429 --> 04:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.750 --> 04:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
that comes before the court and and make
 
04:11:19.109 --> 04:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
a decision under our current law I think
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
while doing something like this
 
04:11:24.429 --> 04:11:24.439 align:start position:0%
maybe may make people feel better and
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
and I C certainly think that there
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
people feel extremely bad in this state
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
about where we are right now with fentel
 
04:11:35.750 --> 04:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just not sure how doing this and
 
04:11:37.750 --> 04:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
making this change to our law would
 
04:11:41.830 --> 04:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
really help uh address that
 
04:11:44.550 --> 04:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
situation represent
 
04:11:48.790 --> 04:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
newal thank you uh Mr chair and um I'll
 
04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
keep it brief
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
um mostly for my own composure but as
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
the one person on this committee who has
 
04:12:01.710 --> 04:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
lost someone to substance use disorder
 
04:12:04.229 --> 04:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
who is actively trying to address it
 
04:12:08.229 --> 04:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
while facing a 15-year mandatory
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
minimum I just I'm going to vote no
 
04:12:13.990 --> 04:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out that there's a
 
04:12:16.990 --> 04:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
big difference between supplying someone
 
04:12:18.550 --> 04:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
with narcotics such as fentanyl that
 
04:12:20.870 --> 04:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
results in death and vers in somebody
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
who's uh trying to get help for somebody
 
04:12:26.109 --> 04:12:26.119 align:start position:0%
who has overdosed and that's where the
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
investigation needs to go and if the
 
04:12:28.990 --> 04:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutors feel they have enough
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
evidence they'll bring it to the next
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
level which is a trial and if uh they
 
04:12:34.189 --> 04:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
can't resolve it during a ple bargain
 
04:12:35.870 --> 04:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
then it will go for a regular trial but
 
04:12:37.349 --> 04:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
having a mandatory sentencing for
 
04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
fentanyl for an enhanced penalty I think
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
is something we definitely need in this
 
04:12:42.239 --> 04:12:45.109 align:start position:0%
is something we definitely need in this
state

04:12:45.109 --> 04:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:12:45.119 --> 04:12:47.149 align:start position:0%
state
representative

04:12:47.149 --> 04:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:12:51.469 --> 04:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
Balden it's odd to argue for uh
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
investigator discretion and against Pro
 
04:12:58.870 --> 04:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
um Court discretion but I I just would
 
04:13:02.670 --> 04:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
genuinely there's very solid Behavioral
 
04:13:06.670 --> 04:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
Science to show that this will not
 
04:13:09.510 --> 04:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
positively impact behavior in terms of
 
04:13:14.070 --> 04:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
saving lives this will
 
04:13:16.830 --> 04:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
most assuredly result in people in a
 
04:13:18.830 --> 04:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
tough situation making the decision to
 
04:13:22.229 --> 04:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
abandon an overdosing person who
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
has roughly 3 to five minutes before
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
brain damage sets in and not M much long
 
04:13:32.149 --> 04:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
after before they are dead in these
 
04:13:34.830 --> 04:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
moments when someone is
 
04:13:37.870 --> 04:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
overdosing 911 needs to be called
 
04:13:40.510 --> 04:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
immediately or the consequences can be
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
irreversible or it could lead to death
 
04:13:46.710 --> 04:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
very quickly and if someone has in those
 
04:13:49.710 --> 04:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
few minutes to decide between calling
 
04:13:52.630 --> 04:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
911 or getting themselves in trouble I
 
04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
would hate for this legislature to set
 
04:13:56.870 --> 04:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
them up so that they're more likely to
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
avoid trouble than to save a life and I
 
04:14:02.469 --> 04:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
would really hate for some sort
 
04:14:07.229 --> 04:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
of partisan mindset or a desire for
 
04:14:09.070 --> 04:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
people to work with certain team members
 
04:14:09.950 --> 04:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
legislature to be a driver for situation
 
04:14:16.229 --> 04:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
in which 911 simply needs to be called
 
04:14:17.830 --> 04:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
there have been many people in this
 
04:14:20.670 --> 04:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
state who died of overdoses from trying
 
04:14:22.710 --> 04:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
a drug the first time we're talking
 
04:14:24.429 --> 04:14:24.439 align:start position:0%
about young people who tried something
 
04:14:26.109 --> 04:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
for the first time didn't know what was
 
04:14:28.030 --> 04:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
in it the person who gave it to them
 
04:14:30.189 --> 04:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
didn't know what was in it why should
 
04:14:33.630 --> 04:14:33.640 align:start position:0%
those people have to die because we want
 
04:14:35.070 --> 04:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
to tell ourselves that we're going to
 
04:14:38.030 --> 04:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
hold their hold the people who gave them
 
04:14:41.309 --> 04:14:41.319 align:start position:0%
the drugs accountable and if we want
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
discretion in the investigative process
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
then we should also have discretion in
 
04:14:50.910 --> 04:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:52.950 --> 04:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
things representative
 
04:14:54.910 --> 04:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
Stone I think this committee should be
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
well aware there's a difference between
 
04:14:58.229 --> 04:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
the role of Judiciary and a role of the
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
executive branch I.E the police and
 
04:15:02.429 --> 04:15:02.439 align:start position:0%
given that they each have a role to
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
fulfill and those roles are pretty
 
04:15:04.319 --> 04:15:05.309 align:start position:0%
fulfill and those roles are pretty
clearly

04:15:05.309 --> 04:15:05.319 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
defined represent scitech I wish this
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill weren't
 
04:15:14.109 --> 04:15:14.119 align:start position:0%
here um if we walk away from this
 
04:15:16.710 --> 04:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
minimum which would probably be imposed
 
04:15:19.229 --> 04:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
in any case we do we send the message
 
04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
that well we walked away from enhanced
 
04:15:26.229 --> 04:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
penalties or from this and I don't like
 
04:15:29.950 --> 04:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
minimums I don't like this bill I I'll I
 
04:15:32.189 --> 04:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
don't think I have a I'm G to vote for
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
it I'm not very happy about
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
it represent wheeler thank you Mr
 
04:15:40.750 --> 04:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
chairman very quickly I just want to say
 
04:15:44.030 --> 04:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
if this bill specifi
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
a an amount of fentanyl that was one
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
that only suppliers
 
04:15:52.229 --> 04:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
and big manufacturers would be using
 
04:15:53.830 --> 04:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
maybe I'd have a different opinion about
 
04:15:56.229 --> 04:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
it but this bill doesn't specify a
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
limited amount it says any person who
 
04:15:59.550 --> 04:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
manufactures sells or dispenses
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
Methamphetamine Lys surgic diamide not
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to use that word last word or PCP
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh and any other drugs in schedule one
 
04:16:12.429 --> 04:16:12.439 align:start position:0%
or two would be sentenced to up to 10
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
years uh in for not less than 10 years
 
04:16:17.189 --> 04:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
of imprisonment and I think that's too
 
04:16:19.870 --> 04:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
far too too much uh for people that
 
04:16:22.990 --> 04:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
might be just happen to have a baggie of
 
04:16:24.510 --> 04:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
fentanyl because they're they're they're
 
04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
drug addicted on the street um or they
 
04:16:29.229 --> 04:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
might pass it off to a friend because
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's the the community that they're a
 
04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
part of unfortunately um I don't think
 
04:16:34.750 --> 04:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
those people should end up in prison for
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
10 years if we're talking about the
 
04:16:39.149 --> 04:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
people who are trafficking fentanyl the
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
big manufacturers those people should
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
have penalties those people should never
 
04:16:44.750 --> 04:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
see the light of day again what they're
 
04:16:47.630 --> 04:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
doing to our communities is horrific but
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is the people
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
who are being impacted by those people
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
and those individuals that are on the
 
04:16:56.790 --> 04:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
ground who have done nothing more than
 
04:16:58.590 --> 04:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
be in a bad place and get addicted to
 
04:17:01.229 --> 04:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
drugs shouldn't be in prison
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
for at least 10 years that's that's too
 
04:17:07.590 --> 04:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
much so thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:17:09.790 --> 04:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:17:15.429 --> 04:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:17.590 --> 04:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
as far as your point getting the the the
 
04:17:19.790 --> 04:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
people higher up the way you get those
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
people is through information from
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
informance and the way you develop
 
04:17:25.109 --> 04:17:25.119 align:start position:0%
informance is when they are facing a
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
stiff penalty in jail so you arrest
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
someone because someone died and they
 
04:17:31.630 --> 04:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
gave them a small amount of Fentanyl and
 
04:17:33.269 --> 04:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
they have a facing a 10-year minimum
 
04:17:35.229 --> 04:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
mandatory they're going to be much more
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
cooperative and they can plead that down
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
and they don't have to do the 10 years
 
04:17:41.149 --> 04:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
so there's there's different tools that
 
04:17:43.469 --> 04:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
you can use and sometimes we even heard
 
04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
during our bail hearings from someone
 
04:17:47.309 --> 04:17:47.319 align:start position:0%
who is a convicted felon himself for
 
04:17:50.429 --> 04:17:50.439 align:start position:0%
dealing drugs recommend to us you want
 
04:17:52.030 --> 04:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
to fix this problem you need to bring
 
04:17:54.550 --> 04:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
back minimum mandatories that's from uh
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
someone who actually has watched people
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
die and who actually helped people detox
 
04:18:02.109 --> 04:18:02.119 align:start position:0%
in his own garage if I recall correctly
 
04:18:05.670 --> 04:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
um so that people can um have different
 
04:18:08.670 --> 04:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
opinions and come to different uh
 
04:18:10.750 --> 04:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
results but the there there is something
 
04:18:11.950 --> 04:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
to be said for both sides of the
 
04:18:14.590 --> 04:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
argument um I think that we know where
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's you are you going to say
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
something different and it's not going
 
04:18:19.790 --> 04:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
to be something about partisanship or
 
04:18:22.630 --> 04:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
something okay go
 
04:18:25.189 --> 04:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
ahead we also heard testimony from
 
04:18:26.790 --> 04:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
people representing the recovery
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
Community professionals the recovery
 
04:18:31.149 --> 04:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
Community people in recovery who argued
 
04:18:32.149 --> 04:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
against this
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and and I think it's worth
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
reiterating that we don't need to be
 
04:18:41.790 --> 04:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
discussing what the threat of jail time
 
04:18:43.830 --> 04:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
will mean for someone one because I
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
guarantee you there will be people who
 
04:18:48.309 --> 04:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
opt not to notify the authorities when
 
04:18:49.950 --> 04:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
they've contributed to the death of
 
04:18:52.830 --> 04:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
another the difference between a
 
04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum 10 and the
 
04:18:59.469 --> 04:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
potential um time for possession alone
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
is so slim if they're already violating
 
04:19:05.830 --> 04:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
the law against possession how is their
 
04:19:07.950 --> 04:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
behavior going to be any different I
 
04:19:10.590 --> 04:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this will motivate
 
04:19:13.429 --> 04:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
anyone to call 911 and Save a Life I
 
04:19:14.950 --> 04:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
think this will motivate people to leave
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
the scene we won't have people serving
 
04:19:20.109 --> 04:19:20.119 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum 10year sentences we'll
 
04:19:22.750 --> 04:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
have more dead
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
bodies further seeing nothing else I'd
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%

04:21:47.950 --> 04:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
376 and I recognize representative Reed
 
04:21:51.710 --> 04:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
to make a motion I motion o um to itl
 
04:21:53.429 --> 04:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
can I have a
 
04:21:56.109 --> 04:21:56.119 align:start position:0%
second would you like to speak to your
 
04:21:59.630 --> 04:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
motion yes Mr chairman um the there's
 
04:22:03.070 --> 04:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
are currently a pathway for um residents
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
of uh our Correctional institutions to
 
04:22:08.950 --> 04:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
get get um to take college credits they
 
04:22:12.030 --> 04:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
pay for them um so they they are
 
04:22:12.040 --> 04:22:13.070 align:start position:0%
pay for them um so they they are
available

04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:22:16.510 --> 04:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
I just think um that um this is not an
 
04:22:19.349 --> 04:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
ideal Pathway to a college degree and
 
04:22:23.189 --> 04:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
should not be encouraged thank you like
 
04:22:26.750 --> 04:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:26.760 --> 04:22:28.710 align:start position:0%
 
second

04:22:28.710 --> 04:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:22:31.229 --> 04:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
um basically what representative Reed
 
04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
said is what I would say I I do remember
 
04:22:35.469 --> 04:22:35.479 align:start position:0%
that I asked some specific questions
 
04:22:37.710 --> 04:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
about education that is currently
 
04:22:41.349 --> 04:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
offered and I do believe that they went
 
04:22:43.990 --> 04:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
into great detail about that that um and
 
04:22:45.950 --> 04:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
the other question I that I had about it
 
04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
was depending on um the length of a
 
04:22:50.670 --> 04:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
sentence which I I think that should be
 
04:22:52.030 --> 04:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
something that is you know that is
 
04:22:54.429 --> 04:22:54.439 align:start position:0%
looked at and that was something that
 
04:22:56.670 --> 04:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to even be a consideration
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
so um for that reason I would be
 
04:23:04.830 --> 04:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:08.030 --> 04:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
discussion repres wheer really quickly I
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
think the points brought are well put
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote against OTP uh itl in
 
04:23:15.550 --> 04:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
support of an interm study or an OTP
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
motion I think uh furthering the
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
commission for this isn't a bad thing
 
04:23:23.309 --> 04:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
and uh the people on it are asking for
 
04:23:26.830 --> 04:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
it so might as well allow them to thank
 
04:23:29.830 --> 04:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
you um represent
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
Muse you we heard during testimony that
 
04:23:33.710 --> 04:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
there there's actually Federal money on
 
04:23:35.710 --> 04:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
the table that would do this um the
 
04:23:37.950 --> 04:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
community college system supported it
 
04:23:39.710 --> 04:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections supported
 
04:23:43.870 --> 04:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
it um I think we should support it too
 
04:23:46.229 --> 04:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Murray thank
 
04:23:49.030 --> 04:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I agree with my
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
colleague representative Muse um this
 
04:23:53.550 --> 04:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
bill was supported by the Department of
 
04:23:56.070 --> 04:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections the community college system
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
um we have federal funds to fund this
 
04:23:59.550 --> 04:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
program so it's not getting funded
 
04:24:02.469 --> 04:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
through our uh State taxpayer dollars um
 
04:24:05.429 --> 04:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
in addition this isn't about they not
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
being um programs currently in our
 
04:24:10.189 --> 04:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
direct Department of Corrections for
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
college degrees it's about a Planning
 
04:24:13.710 --> 04:24:13.720 align:start position:0%
Group that can better work with the
 
04:24:16.469 --> 04:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
colleges to make sure that the programs
 
04:24:18.469 --> 04:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
um and the whole system works adequately
 
04:24:20.830 --> 04:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
and that we are offering a full range of
 
04:24:23.790 --> 04:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
those programs and um I don't really
 
04:24:25.349 --> 04:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
understand why this wouldn't be a way
 
04:24:28.950 --> 04:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
that we would want to um encourage you
 
04:24:31.910 --> 04:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
know better behavior in people like what
 
04:24:33.950 --> 04:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
better way for someone to leave prison
 
04:24:35.389 --> 04:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
than with an education that will help
 
04:24:37.349 --> 04:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
them be an upstanding member of society
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
than you know just someone who's going
 
04:24:41.630 --> 04:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
to leave in a worse position than they
 
04:24:44.510 --> 04:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
entered um I think it's absolutely in
 
04:24:46.750 --> 04:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
our best interest as a society to help
 
04:24:48.870 --> 04:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
people develop themselves um in a
 
04:24:51.109 --> 04:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
variety of ways um while incarcerated so
 
04:24:52.990 --> 04:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
that we can reach our goal which is to
 
04:24:55.229 --> 04:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
have a functioning Society with
 
04:24:56.790 --> 04:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
everybody contributing what they need to
 
04:24:58.469 --> 04:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
to be safe and
 
04:25:03.550 --> 04:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
healthy thank you I I I guess I would
 
04:25:06.910 --> 04:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
say why would someone incarcerated be
 
04:25:08.990 --> 04:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
able to get a free degree that someone
 
04:25:10.990 --> 04:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
who's out here not incarcerated working
 
04:25:13.309 --> 04:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
for has to pay for that's that's where I
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
would have an issue representative Pro
 
04:25:16.030 --> 04:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
you had your hand
 
04:25:18.269 --> 04:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
up I'm wondering what happens when the
 
04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
federal money runs out and then this
 
04:25:24.109 --> 04:25:24.119 align:start position:0%
laws on the book that we have to give
 
04:25:26.429 --> 04:25:26.439 align:start position:0%
them an
 
04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
education I I don't know does anyone
 
04:25:29.710 --> 04:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
have an
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
answer represent Marie has an answer I
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
mean again it's not a law this is not a
 
04:25:37.070 --> 04:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
law in the books that we are like this
 
04:25:39.630 --> 04:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
person has owed this specific program
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is just creating a Planning Group
 
04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
that can maintain
 
04:25:45.590 --> 04:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
a program of Education um while working
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
with the community colleges so there's
 
04:25:50.710 --> 04:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
nothing that's like set in stone by this
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
bill that couldn't be um changed in the
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
future the funding um changed and I I do
 
04:25:59.389 --> 04:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
know that came up in um in the testimony
 
04:26:00.590 --> 04:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
as well I'm trying to find what the
 
04:26:02.030 --> 04:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
04:26:05.269 --> 04:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
was um but if I find that I will answer
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
sure okay representative Reed thank you
 
04:26:09.790 --> 04:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman they the the money the
 
04:26:12.349 --> 04:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
Federal theel grant money that these um
 
04:26:15.269 --> 04:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
inmates can can't access currently um
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's been my understanding that the the
 
04:26:19.790 --> 04:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
college classes are available to people
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
currently and they are underutilized not
 
04:26:24.750 --> 04:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
many um of the inmates do take advantage
 
04:26:27.189 --> 04:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
of the opportunities provided to them
 
04:26:29.990 --> 04:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
presently um the pel grants yes that
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
would be um would continue it's the
 
04:26:34.910 --> 04:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
alliance grant money that potentially
 
04:26:37.590 --> 04:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
would run out and that then would be on
 
04:26:40.710 --> 04:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers to continue funding um and
 
04:26:42.870 --> 04:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
also it is um
 
04:26:45.309 --> 04:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
sends I think the wrong message to the
 
04:26:48.070 --> 04:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
people who work um and pay their way
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
through college as opposed to um having
 
04:26:55.109 --> 04:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
it handed to them um for
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
free represent Mur you had an answer on
 
04:27:01.630 --> 04:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
the um yes thank you um basically along
 
04:27:03.189 --> 04:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
the lines of what representative Reed
 
04:27:04.990 --> 04:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
was saying um but that the grant funding
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
we have is just for the startup of the
 
04:27:10.269 --> 04:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
program it's not in regards to any like
 
04:27:12.429 --> 04:27:12.439 align:start position:0%
it's not the the grant funding is not
 
04:27:15.790 --> 04:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
funding um the college programs
 
04:27:17.309 --> 04:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
themselves it's just funding the
 
04:27:18.670 --> 04:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
starting up of this program and the
 
04:27:21.149 --> 04:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
setting it up so those fees actually
 
04:27:24.429 --> 04:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be um reiterating as the
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
program goes on because the pel grants
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
will cover the actual funds that would
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
be needed um and in terms of saying that
 
04:27:34.670 --> 04:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
um you know out outstanding citizens
 
04:27:36.309 --> 04:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
aren't offered the same opportunity you
 
04:27:38.429 --> 04:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
know pel grants obviously also are
 
04:27:40.030 --> 04:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
available to people outside of prison
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
who um fall into the parameters required
 
04:27:45.710 --> 04:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
they do as long as they don't make too
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
much money and if they work and they
 
04:27:49.630 --> 04:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
have a job that pays reasonably well
 
04:27:51.309 --> 04:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
they don't qualify for p grants but
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
anyone what yeah exactly um but if if
 
04:27:57.550 --> 04:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
you're in prison you obviously qualify
 
04:27:58.630 --> 04:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
because you don't make any money
 
04:28:00.910 --> 04:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
04:28:03.710 --> 04:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
chairman um after looking over my notes
 
04:28:05.710 --> 04:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
here on this bill I did point out to
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters when he was here line 18
 
04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
page two uh says especially in
 
04:28:14.469 --> 04:28:14.479 align:start position:0%

04:28:18.510 --> 04:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
in correction with New England I I I
 
04:28:22.630 --> 04:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
don't know what uh OS was doing that day
 
04:28:24.750 --> 04:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
I know they're working very hard on 1,00
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation but I don't think
 
04:28:29.309 --> 04:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
that Senator Waters meant to have us in
 
04:28:31.670 --> 04:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
coordination with any England Board of
 
04:28:34.070 --> 04:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
higher education and I don't see an
 
04:28:36.630 --> 04:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of me right now so I
 
04:28:40.030 --> 04:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
I well that's true that is true that is
 
04:28:42.630 --> 04:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
true you do never know I don't see an
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of me right now and I
 
04:28:46.630 --> 04:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if I can support uh uh the
 
04:28:48.750 --> 04:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
bill with the type with that typo in it
 
04:28:48.760 --> 04:28:50.349 align:start position:0%
bill with the type with that typo in it
uh

04:28:50.349 --> 04:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
I well I'll vote against it and then
 
04:28:54.790 --> 04:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
support it when we have a FL Amendment
 
04:28:56.830 --> 04:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair may I ask what line is that
 
04:28:59.630 --> 04:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
because in the bill I was given as the
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:06.429 --> 04:29:06.439 align:start position:0%
18 page two line
 
04:29:09.309 --> 04:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
18 ah you're right
 
04:29:12.349 --> 04:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
sorry not to cast any dispersions on our
 
04:29:14.389 --> 04:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
friends across the pond um
 
04:29:14.399 --> 04:29:15.870 align:start position:0%
friends across the pond um
representative

04:29:15.870 --> 04:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:29:19.469 --> 04:29:19.479 align:start position:0%
new thank you Mr chair um we heard
 
04:29:21.790 --> 04:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
testimony when we were talking about
 
04:29:24.670 --> 04:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
um is it truth and sentencing and and
 
04:29:25.950 --> 04:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
ways that people could reduce their
 
04:29:28.109 --> 04:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
sentence right and what really stuck out
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
to me especially when we were uh talking
 
04:29:32.710 --> 04:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
about this subject is the fact that um
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
there are certain things that you can do
 
04:29:37.550 --> 04:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
to get yourself shorter time right um
 
04:29:40.269 --> 04:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
and one of those things is going uh is
 
04:29:42.109 --> 04:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
getting an education so if the
 
04:29:43.590 --> 04:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
difference between somebody being able
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
to um have a lessened uh sentence or
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
anything like that um is is
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
financial that doesn't seem right to me
 
04:29:57.109 --> 04:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
and then you know but then also um the
 
04:29:59.550 --> 04:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
fact that uh the idea of having this
 
04:30:00.870 --> 04:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
working group which is what the bill is
 
04:30:02.269 --> 04:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
actually about right the idea of having
 
04:30:04.590 --> 04:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
this working group to decide you know uh
 
04:30:05.830 --> 04:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
how to go about it and work with
 
04:30:07.229 --> 04:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
community colleges and all that kind of
 
04:30:09.469 --> 04:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
stuff is the idea of saying okay
 
04:30:11.030 --> 04:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
specifically for someone who is
 
04:30:13.309 --> 04:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
incarcerated is something we know people
 
04:30:16.149 --> 04:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
have uh trouble in uh employment after
 
04:30:17.950 --> 04:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
incarceration for a variety of reasons
 
04:30:20.309 --> 04:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
so what they're trying to do is say for
 
04:30:22.109 --> 04:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
someone who is in this position what is
 
04:30:23.630 --> 04:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
the best way what are the best courses
 
04:30:24.910 --> 04:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
of action that we can take the best
 
04:30:27.469 --> 04:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
courses um and programs that we can take
 
04:30:29.229 --> 04:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
for somebody who is specifically in that
 
04:30:31.990 --> 04:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
position to be able to succeed after um
 
04:30:33.830 --> 04:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
they get out of prison so to me it it
 
04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense to have a group
 
04:30:38.109 --> 04:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
which is what the bill is about to say
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
what actually works for this
 
04:30:41.040 --> 04:30:43.630 align:start position:0%
what actually works for this
situation

04:30:43.630 --> 04:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:30:45.149 --> 04:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
Representative no this a question for
 
04:30:48.030 --> 04:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
the chair isn't there if a bill is
 
04:30:50.309 --> 04:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
passed like this with a a type of G
 
04:30:53.429 --> 04:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
graphical error in it can that not be
 
04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
corrected after the bill is passed or
 
04:30:57.349 --> 04:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
how it yeah a floor Amendment could
 
04:30:57.359 --> 04:30:59.070 align:start position:0%
how it yeah a floor Amendment could
correct

04:30:59.070 --> 04:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:31:01.070 --> 04:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah thought they had more
 
04:31:06.109 --> 04:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
latitude than that yeah we may with a
 
04:31:10.269 --> 04:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
enroll bill it yeah yeah representative
 
04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
boltman I just wanted note that
 
04:31:16.349 --> 04:31:16.359 align:start position:0%
um there are many things that prisoners
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
receive that people um who aren't in
 
04:31:20.990 --> 04:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
prison don't receive like Free Housing
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
free food and you know this this very
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee worked really hard to make
 
04:31:27.950 --> 04:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
sure that they had uh open access to
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
menstrual products and clean underwear
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh without stains from other people's U
 
04:31:36.109 --> 04:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
menstrual cycles on them and if we're
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
going to bother to pay to feed and uh
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
house and provide underwear and
 
04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
menstrual pads for folks why not also
 
04:31:47.670 --> 04:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
reform them in the
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
process I would retort that one is basic
 
04:31:53.149 --> 04:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
human care and the other one is a bonus
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
that other people have to work to pay
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
for representative Manion did you have a
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
question oh okay represent Murray thank
 
04:32:02.309 --> 04:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um just continue to go
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
through my notes from the hearing but
 
04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
Nicholas Duffy from the Department of
 
04:32:07.510 --> 04:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
Corrections made sure to note that with
 
04:32:10.429 --> 04:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
each um increase in a degree um in
 
04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
education the level of reci recidivism
 
04:32:16.830 --> 04:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
decreases so education provably reduces
 
04:32:19.229 --> 04:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
crime um and then Mr Cher you had
 
04:32:21.510 --> 04:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
actually asked if the program would end
 
04:32:23.950 --> 04:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
up being um uh saving money for
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because educating folks and
 
04:32:27.309 --> 04:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
preventing further crime and
 
04:32:28.750 --> 04:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
incarceration is cheaper for the
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and Duffy said that that is
 
04:32:32.830 --> 04:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
100% true and that they will have years
 
04:32:34.630 --> 04:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
of Grant reports to prove the efficacy
 
04:32:36.830 --> 04:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
of this program by the time um any
 
04:32:39.269 --> 04:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
federal funds would run out um so
 
04:32:40.750 --> 04:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
honestly in my opinion I would I would
 
04:32:41.950 --> 04:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
really encourage my colleagues to
 
04:32:43.790 --> 04:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
support this bill and if in the future
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
we feel the need to like remove this
 
04:32:47.149 --> 04:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
program we can do that but we have the
 
04:32:49.630 --> 04:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
money right now um and I don't
 
04:32:50.950 --> 04:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
understand why we wouldn't want to take
 
04:32:53.229 --> 04:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
every effort possible to reduce
 
04:32:55.550 --> 04:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
recidivism and reduce the costs on
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers through mass incarceration
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
when we have this option available um
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
for us basically for free because the
 
04:33:06.349 --> 04:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:08.709 --> 04:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
fedit I think I'm not sure but I think
 
04:33:10.830 --> 04:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
the feds get the money from
 
04:33:10.840 --> 04:33:13.709 align:start position:0%
the feds get the money from
us

04:33:13.709 --> 04:33:13.719 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:33:16.470 --> 04:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay um I don't think they just make it
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
up but um further
 
04:33:21.869 --> 04:33:21.879 align:start position:0%
discussion see none uh the motion on the
 
04:33:23.949 --> 04:33:23.959 align:start position:0%
floor is inexpedient to legislate I
 
04:33:26.310 --> 04:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
would ask the clerk to call the role
 
04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%

representative n makes the motion of
 
04:35:04.910 --> 04:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass seconded by represent
 
04:35:08.470 --> 04:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
Murray um discussion can I just say one
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
well first they get she get speak to her
 
04:35:12.429 --> 04:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
motion do you want to speak yeah yeah
 
04:35:16.230 --> 04:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
yeah what discussion well what I what I
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
didn't say last time CU I didn't think I
 
04:35:20.189 --> 04:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
needed to I thought it was already said
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
but there was a very specific reason I
 
04:35:22.680 --> 04:35:24.109 align:start position:0%
but there was a very specific reason I
asked

04:35:24.109 --> 04:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
asked
 
04:35:27.029 --> 04:35:27.039 align:start position:0%
about the length of the sentence because
 
04:35:30.269 --> 04:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
if we are looking at Rehabilitation I
 
04:35:33.910 --> 04:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
would understand that however to say
 
04:35:36.590 --> 04:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
that to say that we have to do all of
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
these things to to help rehabilitate a
 
04:35:41.230 --> 04:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
person I believe that all of us that we
 
04:35:43.109 --> 04:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
here working on the bail bills all
 
04:35:45.551 --> 04:35:45.561 align:start position:0%
summer we have we have said and done a
 
04:35:47.709 --> 04:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
lot to show that we don't want to just
 
04:35:50.551 --> 04:35:50.561 align:start position:0%
quote unquote throw people in jail um
 
04:35:52.590 --> 04:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day if you have a
 
04:35:55.709 --> 04:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
victim that say they do have a college
 
04:35:58.590 --> 04:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
degree and they are working diligently
 
04:36:01.349 --> 04:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
to go to work every day and pay back
 
04:36:04.269 --> 04:36:04.279 align:start position:0%
that loan but now they're looking at
 
04:36:07.510 --> 04:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
default because of the the victim status
 
04:36:10.830 --> 04:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
that they have where they are now not
 
04:36:13.470 --> 04:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
able to continue to have that job how is
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
that fair to them right so for looking
 
04:36:17.551 --> 04:36:17.561 align:start position:0%
at people when they're getting out of
 
04:36:19.590 --> 04:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
jail that's not what this bill says so
 
04:36:21.709 --> 04:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
if you have a person that is in jail for
 
04:36:22.869 --> 04:36:22.879 align:start position:0%
a life
 
04:36:24.750 --> 04:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
sentence to say that they're going to
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
have a better education than the person
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
that they victimized I I can't support
 
04:36:30.590 --> 04:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
that and that is why I won't support the
 
04:36:32.510 --> 04:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
opop pass
 
04:36:35.070 --> 04:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
motion further discussion represent
 
04:36:37.949 --> 04:36:37.959 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um I
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
definitely hear your concerns um Vice
 
04:36:44.070 --> 04:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
chair um I think um in my mind um you
 
04:36:46.590 --> 04:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
know when you brought that up to um I
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
think it was the individual from the
 
04:36:49.949 --> 04:36:49.959 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections you mentioned
 
04:36:52.230 --> 04:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
that you know folks with a life sentence
 
04:36:55.789 --> 04:36:55.799 align:start position:0%
would be at the back of the line um and
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know less likely to be able to take
 
04:36:59.429 --> 04:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
advantage of those programs but
 
04:37:01.590 --> 04:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
additionally I would say people usually
 
04:37:03.470 --> 04:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
do have the option of parole so they
 
04:37:05.109 --> 04:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
still have the chance of entering
 
04:37:07.551 --> 04:37:07.561 align:start position:0%
Society and also you can even just think
 
04:37:10.269 --> 04:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
of like the impact that has on their
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
fellow inmates if you have someone who's
 
04:37:15.750 --> 04:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
like um a violent individual or an
 
04:37:18.269 --> 04:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
unwell individual who can continue to
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
improve in prison like that person will
 
04:37:22.629 --> 04:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
have an impact on the inmates around
 
04:37:26.029 --> 04:37:26.039 align:start position:0%
them and um if you have someone like
 
04:37:28.510 --> 04:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
that wreaking havoc in in prison that's
 
04:37:30.670 --> 04:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
not going to have a positive benefit on
 
04:37:32.510 --> 04:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of the incarcerated individuals
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
and could put them in a position where
 
04:37:37.150 --> 04:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to come out even worse um
 
04:37:38.709 --> 04:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
yeah there's so much to go into but I
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
just think that overall it's a benefit
 
04:37:44.189 --> 04:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
to society as a whole to help everybody
 
04:37:47.869 --> 04:37:47.879 align:start position:0%
become a better person um yeah that's
 
04:37:51.150 --> 04:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
just my position thank you
 
04:37:53.590 --> 04:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative Duty uh yes would it be
 
04:37:55.750 --> 04:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for me to make a comment uh
 
04:37:57.551 --> 04:37:57.561 align:start position:0%
from the county
 
04:38:00.629 --> 04:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
level okay thank you um I chair the
 
04:38:04.269 --> 04:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County um delegation and you
 
04:38:06.670 --> 04:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
know we're actually uh in April we're
 
04:38:09.070 --> 04:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
going to hopefully getting uh um a
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
document talking to us about the
 
04:38:13.470 --> 04:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
planning for a new jail um because we
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
desperately need it and about two years
 
04:38:18.429 --> 04:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
ago a year and a half ago we hired a new
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh for the Department of
 
04:38:24.070 --> 04:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections who is very Progressive um
 
04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
and you know uh so our vision is to
 
04:38:30.150 --> 04:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully build you know a a new
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections not a Valley
 
04:38:34.629 --> 04:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
Street jail so that we can have all of
 
04:38:38.629 --> 04:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
these Services um to to the individuals
 
04:38:41.070 --> 04:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
uh recently we asked for a report in
 
04:38:43.789 --> 04:38:43.799 align:start position:0%
terms of the number of days people
 
04:38:48.109 --> 04:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
served in the um County Jail uh so I my
 
04:38:50.429 --> 04:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
understanding by law is they can't serve
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
more than um they can't be in there more
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
than a year and a day and then they have
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
to go to the state prison you probably
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
know a lot more about this than I do but
 
04:39:02.189 --> 04:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
I mean we have some people in the county
 
04:39:04.349 --> 04:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
jail that have been there for like 2
 
04:39:07.949 --> 04:39:07.959 align:start position:0%
three four years okay it is routine when
 
04:39:10.590 --> 04:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
you look at um the amount of days that
 
04:39:12.189 --> 04:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
they've been there that they've been
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
there for for nine months 11 months just
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
awaiting trial so I mean if if we can
 
04:39:20.189 --> 04:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
look at things where we can take that
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
time and begin to have programs that
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
help them work on all of their issues
 
04:39:28.109 --> 04:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
and get them to move forward I mean
 
04:39:30.029 --> 04:39:30.039 align:start position:0%
that's clearly something that on the
 
04:39:32.470 --> 04:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
county level you know that we want to do
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to give you kind of
 
04:39:34.320 --> 04:39:35.269 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to give you kind of
that

04:39:35.269 --> 04:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:38.030 --> 04:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
background thank you for sharing
 
04:39:40.190 --> 04:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative Stone yeah just to
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
clarify this was geared toward Wards the
 
04:39:42.948 --> 04:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire Department of
 
04:39:44.270 --> 04:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections not any of the county
 
04:39:45.510 --> 04:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
facilities since they all operate
 
04:39:47.470 --> 04:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
independently and in your case where you
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned that a year in a day general
 
04:39:51.430 --> 04:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
rule of thumb is uh most of your county
 
04:39:53.070 --> 04:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
inmates are incarcerated for shorter
 
04:39:54.670 --> 04:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
spans of time but your pre-trial inmates
 
04:39:55.868 --> 04:39:55.878 align:start position:0%
that could be incarcerated there could
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
be a matter of years if they're facing a
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:05.390 --> 04:40:05.400 align:start position:0%

04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
representative here gaite would you like
 
04:42:02.350 --> 04:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion represent Mr
 
04:42:04.868 --> 04:42:04.878 align:start position:0%
chairman I would uh during our testimony
 
04:42:06.430 --> 04:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
it was quite disturbing to think that a
 
04:42:08.430 --> 04:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
chief of police which is usually whether
 
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
you're one horse town or a large agency
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
like Manchester has the Authority in the
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
duty to sign pistol permits in this
 
04:42:15.550 --> 04:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
state as designated by law and that they
 
04:42:17.550 --> 04:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
were some that felt they weren't obliged
 
04:42:19.868 --> 04:42:19.878 align:start position:0%
to due to liability concerns the uh
 
04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of police have the ability upon
 
04:42:23.708 --> 04:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
application to run a uh criminal
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
background check to see suitability and
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
also have local contacts and if they
 
04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
choose to deny it within 14 business
 
04:42:30.670 --> 04:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
days under law they have the ability to
 
04:42:33.470 --> 04:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
do so uh there is a mechanism to appeal
 
04:42:35.350 --> 04:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
if you are denied to the district court
 
04:42:39.030 --> 04:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
or circuit court now and it's just this
 
04:42:40.510 --> 04:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
this needs to happen they need to take
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
their old serious they need to take
 
04:42:42.830 --> 04:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
their job seriously they need to
 
04:42:44.110 --> 04:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
complete it and sign these pistol
 
04:42:45.470 --> 04:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
permits I can't imagine being out of
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
state one that we have reciprocity with
 
04:42:49.270 --> 04:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
and handing them a blank pistol permit
 
04:42:50.948 --> 04:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
filled out with my descriptors but yet
 
04:42:52.628 --> 04:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
it says uh you know in compliance with
 
04:42:55.910 --> 04:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 159 or it's just left blank I think
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's very problematic for anybody who
 
04:42:59.510 --> 04:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
pays the fee to get the license which
 
04:43:01.430 --> 04:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
they're not obligated to get any longer
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
and those fees should be noted they kept
 
04:43:04.510 --> 04:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
in the local coffers they don't go to
 
04:43:07.350 --> 04:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
the state unless it's a non-resident
 
04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
permit representative here cther would
 
04:43:12.150 --> 04:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
you like to speak your a second I agree
 
04:43:14.110 --> 04:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
with my colleague but I also want to
 
04:43:16.868 --> 04:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
mention that it was um approved by um
 
04:43:18.830 --> 04:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement as
 
04:43:21.270 --> 04:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
well supported by law enforcement as
 
04:43:23.910 --> 04:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you I I would just I I would
 
04:43:27.070 --> 04:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
add to the discussion the fact that um
 
04:43:28.670 --> 04:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
you don't need a p Department in New
 
04:43:31.350 --> 04:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unless you're going to travel
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
um to go to another state for
 
04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
reciprocity purposes so to deny a a
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
permit or to not sign it and let
 
04:43:40.470 --> 04:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
somebody have to go off to another state
 
04:43:42.030 --> 04:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
I just think
 
04:43:43.470 --> 04:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
um but I'm going to be charitable and
 
04:43:45.750 --> 04:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
assume that he really did worry about
 
04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
liability and we've taken care of that
 
04:43:52.110 --> 04:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
so let's pass it any further discussion
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%

04:43:56.910 --> 04:43:56.920 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to your motion
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh as somebody who lives
 
04:45:03.150 --> 04:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
in a town that borders um our neighbors
 
04:45:05.750 --> 04:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the South uh I have perally
 
04:45:09.470 --> 04:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
personally witnessed um trafficking into
 
04:45:12.030 --> 04:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire from that
 
04:45:14.190 --> 04:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth and I've actually lost a
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
04:45:19.230 --> 04:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
friends um and colleagues so I'd love to
 
04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
see this
 
04:45:23.230 --> 04:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
pass representative man you like to
 
04:45:25.270 --> 04:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
speak to a second I think uh
 
04:45:28.430 --> 04:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative jamman covet
 
04:45:33.030 --> 04:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
it um I actually brought this exact bill
 
04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
I think four years ago and um it it
 
04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
didn't make it off the floor and I I
 
04:45:40.628 --> 04:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
don't know if this one will either but I
 
04:45:42.350 --> 04:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
support it just like I supported the one
 
04:45:44.628 --> 04:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
I wrote which is
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
mysteriously exactly the same language
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
as this one but having said that
 
04:45:53.830 --> 04:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
um my concern is
 
04:45:56.310 --> 04:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
again we heard some discussion earlier
 
04:45:58.110 --> 04:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
about the effect or non effective
 
04:45:58.120 --> 04:45:59.030 align:start position:0%
about the effect or non effective
minimum

04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
04:46:01.150 --> 04:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
mandatories and someone said something
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
about well if it was trafficking this is
 
04:46:05.470 --> 04:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
trafficking these are people that are
 
04:46:09.948 --> 04:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
bringing quantities of drugs into our
 
04:46:13.470 --> 04:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
state that can only be for dealing it's
 
04:46:15.750 --> 04:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
not personal use this is someone who
 
04:46:18.550 --> 04:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
meets the threshold for dealing drugs
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
and they're coming from and we know this
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
we're coming from two specific places in
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts LEL and Lawrence the the
 
04:46:27.470 --> 04:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
police departments have testified to it
 
04:46:28.788 --> 04:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
it's on the record we know where they're
 
04:46:30.990 --> 04:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
coming from it's a pipeline New York up
 
04:46:32.750 --> 04:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
to there and then splits up and comes up
 
04:46:35.190 --> 04:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
here they're bringing this poison into
 
04:46:37.910 --> 04:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
our state and killing our children we
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
have to stop it somehow um if we could
 
04:46:44.310 --> 04:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
um get the
 
04:46:48.070 --> 04:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
people who are supplying large amounts
 
04:46:49.948 --> 04:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony earlier about how you
 
04:46:52.670 --> 04:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
know these are just um people who are
 
04:46:54.350 --> 04:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
addicted and we don't want to send them
 
04:46:56.430 --> 04:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
to jail because of their addiction well
 
04:46:58.510 --> 04:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
these people that are doing this are the
 
04:47:00.230 --> 04:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
ones who are pumping it into those
 
04:47:02.868 --> 04:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
people so that's where I stand on this
 
04:47:04.548 --> 04:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
bill this is after people who are
 
04:47:06.150 --> 04:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
spreading this poison out and bringing
 
04:47:09.910 --> 04:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:09.920 --> 04:47:11.548 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

04:47:11.548 --> 04:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:47:11.558 --> 04:47:15.590 align:start position:0%
discussion
representa

04:47:15.590 --> 04:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:18.510 --> 04:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
M just like to say that in our current
 
04:47:22.070 --> 04:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
statute um a person who actually
 
04:47:25.030 --> 04:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
transports or uh or possesses with
 
04:47:29.190 --> 04:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
intent to sell um can be sentenced to uh
 
04:47:32.990 --> 04:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
imprisonment of not more than 30 years
 
04:47:37.830 --> 04:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
um so you know again what I would say is
 
04:47:40.910 --> 04:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
that currently our judicial system has
 
04:47:43.788 --> 04:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
the discretion to apply an extremely
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
severe sentence to somebody who
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
transports uh these materials into New
 
04:47:52.868 --> 04:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh frankly
 
04:47:58.470 --> 04:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
um I I understand uh why bills like this
 
04:48:01.230 --> 04:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
are submitted but the reality is is that
 
04:48:03.788 --> 04:48:03.798 align:start position:0%
to a large extent they're political
 
04:48:06.628 --> 04:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
theater and they really won't help us
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
accomplish anything and uh and I wish we
 
04:48:13.230 --> 04:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
could uh turn our attention towards
 
04:48:16.390 --> 04:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
doing things that would actually help
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
solve the problem thanks I would respond
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
by saying that they're not political
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
theater and the people who propose them
 
04:48:25.590 --> 04:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
think that they will help solve the
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
problem I would also submit that someone
 
04:48:32.910 --> 04:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
who comes here and is arrested for um
 
04:48:35.868 --> 04:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
possession intent is eligible for bail
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
and often times they make bail and we
 
04:48:39.430 --> 04:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
never see them again because they're
 
04:48:40.830 --> 04:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
either not from the state or not from
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
from this country and when they are here
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
arrested on being held on a minimum
 
04:48:47.310 --> 04:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory they will not make bail and
 
04:48:49.150 --> 04:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
they will stay and they will serve their
 
04:48:52.548 --> 04:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
sentence and um and that's really the
 
04:48:54.910 --> 04:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
thing is is we want people when they say
 
04:48:57.070 --> 04:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
hey the these this fentel needs to be
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
moved up to Manchester today I want them
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
to look at each other and say no you go
 
04:49:03.270 --> 04:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
no you go because I'm not going up there
 
04:49:05.230 --> 04:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
because they'll put me away for at least
 
04:49:08.830 --> 04:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
this long and that's what we want
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
discouragement um representative
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
read and then Stone um thank you Mr
 
04:49:17.708 --> 04:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
chairman we had testimony from um a a
 
04:49:20.750 --> 04:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
person who uh was trafficking drugs into
 
04:49:22.230 --> 04:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and he spent time in
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
federal prison for it and he said the
 
04:49:25.990 --> 04:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
reason he came to New Hampshire was
 
04:49:28.628 --> 04:49:28.638 align:start position:0%
because our drug laws were really LAX he
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
said that it was easier to go to New
 
04:49:32.070 --> 04:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and make a lot of money
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
selling drugs here than it it was to
 
04:49:37.628 --> 04:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
take a risk to go to Maine so to they he
 
04:49:41.310 --> 04:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
saw us as a um lucrative place to sell
 
04:49:45.030 --> 04:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
his drugs because of our um LAX laws
 
04:49:46.948 --> 04:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
thank you yes I recall that testimony
 
04:49:48.350 --> 04:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Stone did
 
04:49:51.510 --> 04:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
you have yes thank you Mr chair with
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
drug trafficking from out of state we
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
have a problem and we address drug
 
04:49:59.510 --> 04:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
problems on many facets we hear about
 
04:50:01.830 --> 04:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
harm reduction where we focus on the
 
04:50:04.030 --> 04:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
users or the victims of the drug trade
 
04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
but we have to have some accountability
 
04:50:07.030 --> 04:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
for the individuals who are making the
 
04:50:09.708 --> 04:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
money and profiting off the misery of
 
04:50:11.430 --> 04:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
our citizens and what better way to do
 
04:50:12.910 --> 04:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
it than to send a message that says that
 
04:50:14.670 --> 04:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
if you get caught trafficking drugs into
 
04:50:17.070 --> 04:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
the state you will be held accountable I
 
04:50:18.548 --> 04:50:18.558 align:start position:0%
don't hear the word accountable very
 
04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
much in this Committee just like I don't
 
04:50:22.030 --> 04:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
hear and focus on the victims as much in
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
this committee and I often wonder why
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
that is since this is criminal justice
 
04:50:28.390 --> 04:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:32.788 --> 04:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
Safety representative new
 
04:50:35.150 --> 04:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
Newman I'm having a lot of difficulty
 
04:50:36.948 --> 04:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out all this talk about
 
04:50:40.910 --> 04:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
trafficking and trying to get that to uh
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
based on the way the bill is written and
 
04:50:46.270 --> 04:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
it says in addition to any other penalty
 
04:50:48.590 --> 04:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
under this section that any person who
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
enters the state with any quality of a
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
fentol drug etc etc etc shall be guilty
 
04:50:57.470 --> 04:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
of a class a felony I believe that's
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's holding people accountable with
 
04:51:01.548 --> 04:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
class a felony and then it puts on a
 
04:51:04.510 --> 04:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory five years in jail no matter
 
04:51:06.948 --> 04:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
what the the the penalty was so I'm
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
having trouble with that didn't you any
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
the etc etc etc didn't it say say
 
04:51:12.948 --> 04:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
something about what the intent to
 
04:51:15.868 --> 04:51:15.878 align:start position:0%
distribute no I'm not sure that I
 
04:51:21.788 --> 04:51:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:24.830 --> 04:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
TR I don't see anything no I don't
 
04:51:28.390 --> 04:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
reading it again read line four four
 
04:51:33.150 --> 04:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
four it's on the fold tend to distribute
 
04:51:35.310 --> 04:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
okay I'll have to just improve my
 
04:51:36.830 --> 04:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
reading skills but it there is
 
04:51:39.548 --> 04:51:39.558 align:start position:0%
accountability with the class a felony
 
04:51:43.470 --> 04:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
represent Murray thank you Mr chair um
 
04:51:45.390 --> 04:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
to be clear uh to my colleague
 
04:51:47.070 --> 04:51:47.080 align:start position:0%
representative Newman the Class I felony
 
04:51:48.788 --> 04:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
that's actually a new line in here cuz
 
04:51:51.310 --> 04:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
the whole paragraph is new it's not like
 
04:51:54.430 --> 04:51:54.440 align:start position:0%
the current yeah but um you just brought
 
04:51:56.190 --> 04:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
up something that was my concern as well
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
was about the quantity but um I guess
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
with the intent to distribute would that
 
04:52:02.510 --> 04:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
mean that there would also need to be
 
04:52:04.990 --> 04:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
like other materials that are used for
 
04:52:06.510 --> 04:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
distribute like extra baggies or
 
04:52:08.350 --> 04:52:08.360 align:start position:0%
something like how do they prove that
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah there has to be further indicia of
 
04:52:12.788 --> 04:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
of dist intend to distribute um it's not
 
04:52:14.830 --> 04:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
merely based on weight represent Stone
 
04:52:17.190 --> 04:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
you compar to elaborate yeah I'd like to
 
04:52:19.868 --> 04:52:19.878 align:start position:0%
point out also that uh it with our some
 
04:52:21.628 --> 04:52:21.638 align:start position:0%
of our entities that do drug enforcement
 
04:52:23.788 --> 04:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
in our state it's customarily to work
 
04:52:25.750 --> 04:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
with the federal authorities in
 
04:52:27.470 --> 04:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes cases we brought even though
 
04:52:28.590 --> 04:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
they start out as a state case they'll
 
04:52:30.390 --> 04:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
be brought as a federal case in which
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
the federal guidelines for asset
 
04:52:33.788 --> 04:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
forfeiture kick in and sentencing so
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps in an example is say you're
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
trafficking drugs from Massachusetts and
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
you have a hidden compartment in your
 
04:52:39.708 --> 04:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle where you have you've made
 
04:52:41.390 --> 04:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
it that way and you have a concealed
 
04:52:44.030 --> 04:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
firearm you will actually do more time
 
04:52:45.750 --> 04:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
on the uh the firearm possession with
 
04:52:47.548 --> 04:52:47.558 align:start position:0%
drug trafficking and your vehicle will
 
04:52:47.558 --> 04:52:48.270 align:start position:0%
drug trafficking and your vehicle will
be

04:52:48.270 --> 04:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:52:50.390 --> 04:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
seized but but with regard to her
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
question about the in difference between
 
04:52:54.990 --> 04:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
possession and P possession intent yeah
 
04:52:57.030 --> 04:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
with intent generally you're looking at
 
04:52:58.430 --> 04:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh I hate to say it but there's a lot of
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
times that individuals are targeted for
 
04:53:02.110 --> 04:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
distribution that they know they're
 
04:53:03.708 --> 04:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
under being watched and when they come
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
in they get picked off that's not
 
04:53:08.110 --> 04:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
uncommon billing a case in addition if
 
04:53:09.750 --> 04:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
you're caught with distribution such as
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
baggies or larger amount than what's
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
known as personal use for a reasonable
 
04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
person uh if your your your packaging is
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
all individually it's kind of hard to
 
04:53:19.868 --> 04:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
say it's personally use if you got 120
 
04:53:23.310 --> 04:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
bags of fentanyl in your car there's
 
04:53:25.510 --> 04:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
that and a lot of times what it is it'll
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
be a a control buy or buy bust so
 
04:53:31.270 --> 04:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
they'll uh they'll have someone they'll
 
04:53:33.750 --> 04:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
make several buys from that person and
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
then the they'll say okay I'm going down
 
04:53:38.830 --> 04:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
to pick up another 50 grams or whatever
 
04:53:40.270 --> 04:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
okay the third time they go to meet them
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
they trust them they come up they bust
 
04:53:44.430 --> 04:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
them that time um that's where they get
 
04:53:45.788 --> 04:53:45.798 align:start position:0%
the intent to distribute because they've
 
04:53:48.548 --> 04:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
already distributed previously so it's
 
04:53:50.230 --> 04:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's generally speaking how
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
that works and and what he said
 
04:53:54.910 --> 04:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
regarding the um regarding the secret
 
04:53:56.910 --> 04:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
compartments you'd be fascinated to see
 
04:53:58.350 --> 04:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
the lengths and the money that these
 
04:54:00.470 --> 04:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
cartels go to to build these into these
 
04:54:03.788 --> 04:54:03.798 align:start position:0%
cars they take these vehicles to a a
 
04:54:06.548 --> 04:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
shop and they literally tear them apart
 
04:54:08.708 --> 04:54:08.718 align:start position:0%
and they build these things into the car
 
04:54:10.510 --> 04:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
that you like have to stand on one foot
 
04:54:12.270 --> 04:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
and pull your rear and pressure to get
 
04:54:14.708 --> 04:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
these these compartments to open and
 
04:54:16.548 --> 04:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
they're insulated so that dogs can't
 
04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
smell they spend a lot of money on these
 
04:54:20.868 --> 04:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
these hides when they come across these
 
04:54:22.990 --> 04:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
state lines representative stone I'd
 
04:54:24.110 --> 04:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
like to follow up with something you
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
said Mr chairman I've personally seen in
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
my own experience where individuals
 
04:54:29.190 --> 04:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
cooperating with law enforcement have
 
04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
actually traveled down under supervision
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
to the state of Massachusetts returned
 
04:54:34.670 --> 04:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire where it
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
was orchestrated for the actual takedown
 
04:54:38.708 --> 04:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
and arrest to occur and it's usually
 
04:54:40.110 --> 04:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
coordinated with the outside agencies
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
and possibly DEA or someone else working
 
04:54:44.270 --> 04:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
as a liaison so this is a common
 
04:54:45.628 --> 04:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
practice so that if this did come
 
04:54:47.510 --> 04:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
through we'd be able to have an enhanced
 
04:54:48.990 --> 04:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
penalty for the drug trafficking after
 
04:54:50.830 --> 04:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
the case has been
 
04:54:52.830 --> 04:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
built he you had another question
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
represent yes thank you Mr chair um I'm
 
04:54:57.548 --> 04:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
wishing I had brought an amendment to
 
04:54:58.670 --> 04:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
this and maybe I will bring it to the
 
04:55:00.948 --> 04:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
floor because yeah that specifically the
 
04:55:02.350 --> 04:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
intent to distribute making sure that
 
04:55:04.470 --> 04:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's clear maybe we add like uh
 
04:55:06.670 --> 04:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
minimum quantity or something but the
 
04:55:08.830 --> 04:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
other thing that I was thinking of is um
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
someone during testimony
 
04:55:13.150 --> 04:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
um brought up the concern that if we
 
04:55:15.830 --> 04:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
make it um you know at this mandatory
 
04:55:18.190 --> 04:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
minimum for crossing the border then are
 
04:55:20.110 --> 04:55:20.120 align:start position:0%
we increasing the risk that you know
 
04:55:22.670 --> 04:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
someone picks up and moves their uh
 
04:55:25.628 --> 04:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
operation from Lawrence to Salem OR you
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
know what I mean and just goes moves
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
right across the border in order to
 
04:55:32.628 --> 04:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
avoid this um penalty extra penalty for
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
driving the the fenel across the border
 
04:55:37.510 --> 04:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
and I would just be concerned about the
 
04:55:41.788 --> 04:55:41.798 align:start position:0%
potential impact of like an increased um
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know more drug operations being
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
brought into the state in order to try
 
04:55:47.910 --> 04:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
and avoid the travel
 
04:55:49.910 --> 04:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
issue did you want to
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
answer unfortunately it's been a history
 
04:55:53.788 --> 04:55:53.798 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that uh we're easy
 
04:55:55.628 --> 04:55:55.638 align:start position:0%
pickings and a lot of times a lot of
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
efforts are are purposely directed
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
towards out ofate operations that do
 
04:56:01.070 --> 04:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
come to smaller communities such as
 
04:56:04.030 --> 04:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
mining clamont Newport um I'm sure in
 
04:56:06.150 --> 04:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
your Manchester has them too these
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
people come here because it's such a
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
target-rich environment to sell product
 
04:56:11.590 --> 04:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
and they can blend in pretty quick and
 
04:56:13.390 --> 04:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
not be noticed for a while and the only
 
04:56:14.590 --> 04:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
time you usually get those people is
 
04:56:15.708 --> 04:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
when you get somebody on the hook and
 
04:56:17.230 --> 04:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
you flip them and they go right up the
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
chain and usually you get the guy that
 
04:56:20.788 --> 04:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
moved here from Massachusetts and
 
04:56:21.868 --> 04:56:21.878 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you the story of how they
 
04:56:21.878 --> 04:56:23.150 align:start position:0%
they'll tell you the story of how they
got

04:56:23.150 --> 04:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
got
 
04:56:25.948 --> 04:56:25.958 align:start position:0%
here and to your to specifically to your
 
04:56:27.628 --> 04:56:27.638 align:start position:0%
question will that encourage them to
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
okay we're not going to do this state
 
04:56:30.470 --> 04:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
lot anymore well at some point they got
 
04:56:32.110 --> 04:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
to get here I mean it's got to come in
 
04:56:34.190 --> 04:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
some way so if if even if they're going
 
04:56:35.270 --> 04:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
to say we're going to shut up our
 
04:56:38.788 --> 04:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
distribution shop in man in Hampshire to
 
04:56:40.430 --> 04:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
get away from the crossing the they
 
04:56:41.670 --> 04:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
still get across the border to get it
 
04:56:43.628 --> 04:56:43.638 align:start position:0%
here so at some point they're going to
 
04:56:45.230 --> 04:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
run into that minimum mandatory of
 
04:56:46.628 --> 04:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
importing it for the intent to
 
04:56:49.270 --> 04:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
distribute um representative Ro thank
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
04:56:53.788 --> 04:56:53.798 align:start position:0%
chairman so it's obviously not a secret
 
04:56:56.070 --> 04:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
that fentol is coming up in this
 
04:56:58.948 --> 04:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
committee I feel like it's every day at
 
04:56:58.958 --> 04:56:59.750 align:start position:0%
committee I feel like it's every day at
this

04:56:59.750 --> 04:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:57:02.750 --> 04:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
point and it's also evident that these
 
04:57:06.110 --> 04:57:06.120 align:start position:0%
drugs are doing irreversible harm to our
 
04:57:08.350 --> 04:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
families it's eroding our
 
04:57:11.190 --> 04:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
society it's creating
 
04:57:14.150 --> 04:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
this awful division right here amongst
 
04:57:16.390 --> 04:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
us and everybody thinks they have the
 
04:57:19.750 --> 04:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
best way to solve this problem so we
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
admit that there clearly is a problem
 
04:57:27.708 --> 04:57:27.718 align:start position:0%
so I can't think of of of a better
 
04:57:30.830 --> 04:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
way to stop something than to have this
 
04:57:33.070 --> 04:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a deterrent and what
 
04:57:34.670 --> 04:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative Murray just said was well
 
04:57:36.670 --> 04:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
is it going to make them you know not so
 
04:57:39.750 --> 04:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
it here so it there I hope so I hope it
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
makes them not bring it back into New
 
04:57:43.750 --> 04:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anymore I hope that that that
 
04:57:46.990 --> 04:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
is you know the end result of it
 
04:57:49.868 --> 04:57:49.878 align:start position:0%
um but but I feel like if we could did I
 
04:57:52.030 --> 04:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstand what you said yeah oh I'm
 
04:57:54.548 --> 04:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry well point is
 
04:57:56.788 --> 04:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
is don't bring it don't bring it into
 
04:57:57.990 --> 04:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's obviously what my
 
04:58:00.830 --> 04:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
what my point is here but you know
 
04:58:03.948 --> 04:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
during the testimony um there was a
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative said well it's to the
 
04:58:06.670 --> 04:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
point where fentanyl is and everything
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
well if we know fentanyl's and
 
04:58:10.548 --> 04:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
everything then we go back to this big
 
04:58:12.150 --> 04:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
circle of well when then we have harm
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
reduction well do we need harm reduction
 
04:58:15.150 --> 04:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
if we know it's in everything it this
 
04:58:17.670 --> 04:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
endless circle of at some point we have
 
04:58:19.948 --> 04:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
to do something to stop it we have to
 
04:58:22.628 --> 04:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
and I feel like we've tried everything
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
else I just don't know what other option
 
04:58:25.830 --> 04:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
we have at this
 
04:58:28.590 --> 04:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
point and I apologize if I misunderstood
 
04:58:30.430 --> 04:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
no it's all right she you kind of got
 
04:58:35.270 --> 04:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
just a wrong State um represent Pro so
 
04:58:37.510 --> 04:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot about har reduction
 
04:58:40.590 --> 04:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
right we want to do that the best way to
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
get harm reduction and stop it from
 
04:58:44.868 --> 04:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
coming into the into the state right so
 
04:58:48.030 --> 04:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
all our citizens are safe so if we have
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
to attack five years onto their sentence
 
04:58:53.270 --> 04:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
to make them think twice about coming to
 
04:58:55.830 --> 04:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so be it they're not
 
04:58:59.470 --> 04:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
victims they choose to distribute drugs
 
04:59:02.948 --> 04:59:02.958 align:start position:0%
in our state nobody's forcing them
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
that's their choice and if they're going
 
04:59:07.110 --> 04:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
to choose to come here and sell drugs
 
04:59:10.150 --> 04:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
and bring it across the border then yeah
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
yeah they're going to pay for it and
 
04:59:14.430 --> 04:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
then they won't be out for another extra
 
04:59:18.270 --> 04:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
5 years bringing drugs
 
04:59:21.270 --> 04:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
across I think I would add to that we've
 
04:59:24.670 --> 04:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
um I I we have we've we've we're doing
 
04:59:27.070 --> 04:59:27.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a carrot and stick thing here we
 
04:59:30.350 --> 04:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
we have extended a lot of um help and
 
04:59:31.708 --> 04:59:31.718 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we're going to extend more
 
04:59:34.030 --> 04:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
towards the the addicted community and
 
04:59:37.310 --> 04:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
and I agree that it's a disease and they
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
once you're hooked on this you can't
 
04:59:41.230 --> 04:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
stop um you're sick and you can't you
 
04:59:43.670 --> 04:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
got to get better but what we need to do
 
04:59:46.150 --> 04:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
is we need and we haven't tried this yet
 
04:59:47.708 --> 04:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
we've we've been dealing with this for a
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
decade now we need to do something to
 
04:59:51.868 --> 04:59:51.878 align:start position:0%
stop the people who are bringing the
 
04:59:55.030 --> 04:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
disease in um if while we're treating
 
04:59:57.868 --> 04:59:57.878 align:start position:0%
the sick let's stop the
 
05:00:00.948 --> 05:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
disease um I think we've beat this one
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
pretty good so I'm going to ask the cter
 
05:00:03.830 --> 05:00:03.840 align:start position:0%

05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%

05:03:21.310 --> 05:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:24.110 --> 05:03:24.120 align:start position:0%

bill hold on a second um seconded uh
 
05:03:33.948 --> 05:03:33.958 align:start position:0%

05:03:33.958 --> 05:03:38.788 align:start position:0%

representative

05:03:38.788 --> 05:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:38.798 --> 05:03:45.230 align:start position:0%
 
Ro

05:03:45.230 --> 05:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:47.310 --> 05:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
U very quickly this bill is actually
 
05:03:49.470 --> 05:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
duplicative of of a bill that we passed
 
05:03:51.670 --> 05:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
earlier in the session uh unanimously
 
05:03:53.708 --> 05:03:53.718 align:start position:0%
that actually went to consent uh that
 
05:03:56.070 --> 05:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
bill is now in the hands of the Senate
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh and So to avoid having two bills
 
05:04:02.230 --> 05:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
crossing over at the same time um I
 
05:04:04.590 --> 05:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
recommend we interim study this bill uh
 
05:04:05.948 --> 05:04:05.958 align:start position:0%
and if anything happens to the other
 
05:04:08.030 --> 05:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
bill and the other body
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if we're still alive
 
05:04:15.150 --> 05:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
here but um uh but hopefully um you know
 
05:04:17.110 --> 05:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
we can do something with
 
05:04:19.990 --> 05:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
it and who was your seconded that would
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your second it was
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
already stated thank you thank you yeah
 
05:04:27.830 --> 05:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
um whenever I see I just for the record
 
05:04:30.510 --> 05:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
whenever I see a bill that looks exactly
 
05:04:32.470 --> 05:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
like the bill I already heard um that
 
05:04:34.190 --> 05:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
means I'm holding another
 
05:04:36.670 --> 05:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
hearing um like the hearing I already
 
05:04:38.948 --> 05:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
held I don't like doing that so I really
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate you making that motion
 
05:04:43.628 --> 05:04:43.638 align:start position:0%
representative um any further
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
discussion representative jamman yes Mr
 
05:04:48.910 --> 05:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh because the pending motion
 
05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be interim study when it comes to
 
05:04:52.270 --> 05:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
the house floor I think we should table
 
05:04:55.110 --> 05:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
it so that if the Senate doesn't act on
 
05:04:56.510 --> 05:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
the bill that's before them we can pull
 
05:04:59.548 --> 05:04:59.558 align:start position:0%
it off the table and and pass
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
it I would too but I wouldn't have said
 
05:05:03.430 --> 05:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
it out loud
 
05:05:07.110 --> 05:05:07.120 align:start position:0%

05:09:42.990 --> 05:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley did a good job this
 
05:09:46.190 --> 05:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
morning um this study committee is on
 
05:09:48.070 --> 05:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
the parole system we worked very
 
05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
diligently over the fall uh I think that
 
05:09:53.190 --> 05:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
there is more work I think
 
05:09:55.030 --> 05:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative Reed said we had beat a
 
05:09:57.110 --> 05:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
dead horse as much as we can but I think
 
05:09:58.868 --> 05:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
the horse is still living unfortunately
 
05:10:03.150 --> 05:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
