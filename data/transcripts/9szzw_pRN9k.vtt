um 24. some of you may be familiar with
 
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
the process we go through to the grant
 
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
to confer degree granting Authority the
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
institution approaches the department of
 
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
education does all the paperwork it
 
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
needs to do gets the sign off from the
 
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
um commissioner and then we have to pass
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
a bill granting the actual Authority and
 
00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
then the um the higher education
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
commission uh does the detailed work on
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
which degrees are are accepted and and
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh so forth on these programs
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
um I we've done this most recently for
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
Signum University but if you look we've
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
done this uh quite a few times over the
 
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
years and I'm particularly interested in
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
this because we are really growing in
 
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
aeronautical industry in in New
 
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire aeronautical education
 
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
programs and uh this is a really good
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
fit for us the Newland aeronautical
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
Institute it's a new online institution
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
based in House New Hampshire it's a
 
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
board of um of directors 10 members who
 
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
have long experienced in the aviation
 
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
um industry it's going to be conferring
 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419 align:start position:0%
a Bachelor of Science in aviation and uh
 
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
it is intended for folks who are already
 
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
in industry in the workforce or want to
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
come into the industry and depending on
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
if you um
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
are new to the industry it might be a
 
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
three and a half year full-time study
 
00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
program so very thorough ba and then if
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
you're coming in as you're already been
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
a pilot for example you can get uh up to
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
a Year's credit
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
um for the work that you've done
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
industry already but that still be a two
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
and a half year
 
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
um two and a half year per program uh
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
you can look at them on online uh I
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
think you'll see a very good good plan a
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
very strong educational
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
um uh program and so uh I will leave it
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
at that and be happy to answer such
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
questions I'm as I may be able to thank
 
00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
you very much Senator are there
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee okay
 
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
yes represent luno thank you very much
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you very much Senator
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
waters for bringing this forward have
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
has some New England aeronautical and
 
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
suit operated in in any other state so
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
so far this would be its first to
 
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
receive accreditation okay yeah and it
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
is it is based in Hollis so it's natural
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
enough they come do us and uh I think a
 
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
um institutions find New Hampshire very
 
00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
good to work with and get their
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
credentialing here because it's well
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
recognized in other states okay great
 
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
thank you and a follow-up to that yes
 
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
um you said accreditation but you're
 
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
talking about approved degree granting
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
Authority yeah and and I I think from
 
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
the Signum experience
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
um first comes degree granting Authority
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then comes accreditation is that how
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
that works okay thank you thank you
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
are there further questions yes
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
are there any other institutions in New
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
England that offer the same
 
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:31.820 align:start position:0%
um programs as the New England
 
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
aeronautical I don't know
 
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm I'm not I'm not I'm not sure
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
what the other follow-up questions are
 
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
reps and Applebee I'm representative
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
you're getting promoted yeah we'll we'll
 
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
have some do you have anything on that
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
okay I can guess yeah okay
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
other questions from the company yes
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
represent representative cascaden thank
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
question Senator
 
00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220 align:start position:0%
um it seems I I recall um years ago
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
there was a Daniel Webster College I
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
think that wasn't aeronautical
 
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:06.260 align:start position:0%
Institution for degreed is this program
 
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
mirrored after that or is it anywhere
 
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
similar well this is it's this is online
 
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
yes I was able to offer uh experiences
 
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
experiential part of it
 
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
um and uh but in terms of the degree in
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
offering this bachelor's degree that is
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
I think a very standard degree in the
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
way they have outlined it in terms of
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
specializations within it so I think the
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
distinction here is it's an online
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
I have one Senator has a higher
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
education Commission of course they've
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
reviewed the application and all uh were
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
there any recommendations made to them
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
in regard to bonding Finance aspects of
 
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
the of the commission to you know and to
 
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
ensure that they don't open up and then
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden disappear and students
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
lose and whatever they put into it
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
well that's your question I can't really
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
answer it I just know that the Christian
 
00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:04.019 align:start position:0%
Abu has said that they've done their
 
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
process and they have approved
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
um this this moving forward so I don't I
 
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
perhaps Mr Appleby can talk a little bit
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
more about those aspects of it but uh I
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
think in a sense like any business those
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
aspects would be covered that's all part
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.200 align:start position:0%

this forward to us uh could you outline
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
what the content of the curriculum is
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
for this program please yes so they seek
 
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
to address a need in the marketplace
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
that exists
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
um where there are a lack of qualified
 
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
managers in the aviation industry right
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
so they've got and we know about the
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
lack of Pilots this is not a pilot
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
program which is different than
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
um Daniel Webster's program many years
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
ago was focused on pilots and mechanics
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
this is focused on management and very
 
00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
specifically uh you know Airline
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
managers Logistics managers those types
 
00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:00.779 align:start position:0%
of roles in the aviation industry
 
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
globally and there are this is a global
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
organization they're hoping to be they
 
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
see a real need in Africa and Asia for
 
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
these individuals so
 
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
um that's the content focus is
 
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
management Logistics
 
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%

makeup of the commission our College
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
presidents Etc so that they know who is
 
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
doing the review of these applications
 
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.370 align:start position:0%
doing the review of these applications
certainly

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair so uh the higher
 
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:51.500 align:start position:0%
education commission is a statutory body
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
that includes
 
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.189 align:start position:0%
that includes
um

00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
essentially all of our four-year public
 
00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
College presidents so the presidents of
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
Keene Plymouth Durham Grant State
 
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
College for a little longer as well as
 
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
the chancellors of both of our higher
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
education public higher education
 
00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:09.650 align:start position:0%
education public higher education
systems

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
two presidents from the community
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
college system and they rotate over the
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
years and then there are a number of
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
spots for private college presidents So
 
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
currently the president of New England
 
00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
College the President of Franklin Pierce
 
00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
University they serve on the commission
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
as well and then there are some lay
 
00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:27.650 align:start position:0%
as well and then there are some lay
members

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
um so it is uh really it's the higher
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
education leaders from our state on this
 
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.790 align:start position:0%
education leaders from our state on this
Commission

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
are there yes representative Miler thank
 
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
you uh the question was raised I think
 
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
by the chair of Senator Waters when you
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
do your review what's the bonding issue
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
that you're looking for as relates to
 
00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:53.579 align:start position:0%
um ensuring that students who engage in
 
00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:56.339 align:start position:0%
this process uh will not be left high
 
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
and dry around that we've had a bill
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
that came before us on before this
 
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
session on this could you just outline
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
what you look at when you are doing this
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
review yes indemnification yeah thank
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative so
 
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
um the previous school that came was for
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
licensed career schools they are
 
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:15.740 align:start position:0%
non-degree granting
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
and in the case of higher education it's
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
a little different and it's really much
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
there is no statutory requirement for
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
bonding in the higher education World
 
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.490 align:start position:0%
bonding in the higher education World
um

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
but it is taken Case by case in the case
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
of Sigman University
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
um the review team felt and the
 
00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:33.299 align:start position:0%
legislature agreed that bonding would be
 
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
wise in in the case of any AI their
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
finances are extremely strong uh the
 
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
review team reviewed their finances in
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
depth in fact
 
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:45.539 align:start position:0%
um one of the review team members is the
 
00:17:48.409 --> 00:17:48.419 align:start position:0%
CFO from a local college and really
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time with their Finance
 
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
folks reviewing
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
um looking at who's investing looking at
 
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
bank lines of credit and they are very
 
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
well capitalized so no bonding
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
requirement was put into the
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the review team
 
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.230 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
yes

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
um thanks uh to I guess to what extent
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
does the higher education commission
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
also consider the um the uh and Senator
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
Waters mentioned this the um the
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
experience and membership on their the
 
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
um uh the institute's board of directors
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering what sort of what
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
sort of experience
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
um and backgrounds are um are the higher
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
is the higher education commission
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
looking for in particular as it relates
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
to a um to uh Aviation management
 
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.430 align:start position:0%
to a um to uh Aviation management
Logistics

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
Logistics
 
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.049 align:start position:0%
Logistics
um

00:18:41.049 --> 00:18:41.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
organization great so uh thank you for
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
the question representative so
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
um the review team looks at the board of
 
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
directors again as part of its overall
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
review and depending on the makeup of
 
00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0%
that board may make recommendations uh
 
00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:57.419 align:start position:0%
in the case of any AI they came before
 
00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
the commission initially with their
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
proposal with a very strong board with
 
00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:03.419 align:start position:0%
um individuals from the aviation
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
industry an individual from the global
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
accreditor of Aviation programs
 
00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:13.340 align:start position:0%
as well as a number of local leaders
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
in higher education and politics here in
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
our state so it was a very strong board
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
in this case and again
 
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
because of the folks involved the the
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
review team and ultimately the
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
commission were very comfortable with
 
00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:30.299 align:start position:0%
the level of experience and expertise
 
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
and in fact the president of neaai is Dr
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
Trent Flores who was the former dean of
 
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
the Daniel Webster flight program for
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
many years and it's also a commercial
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
pilot so he has extensive ties and
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the industry
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative Balboni thank you Mr
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
question I'm really not familiar with
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
this industry at all so I'm just curious
 
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:57.539 align:start position:0%
um since there you say it's not training
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
Pilots per se what what type of careers
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
are they being trained to do what kind
 
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
of positions would they hold after they
 
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.230 align:start position:0%
of positions would they hold after they
graduated

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
graduated
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um so these
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
are management and Logistics management
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
positions within
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
um you know the Aerospace industry so if
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
you think about a UPS or even American
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
Airlines they have managers and those
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
managers need to know
 
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
um the aviation industry they're not
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
just off the shelf
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
folks right they have very specialized
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
knowledge for those positions so the
 
00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
school seeks to train individuals some
 
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
of them may be current Pilots looking to
 
00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:37.460 align:start position:0%
move up but train them for these roles
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
you know if we think about UPS it's
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
Logistics is their whole world Amazon
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
very often and this so there's a real
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
need for these these types of folks in
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
these positions so their their
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
management but a real focus on the
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
aviation industry
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Tanner
 
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:20:59.810 --> 00:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
question will they be uh I know the last
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
time we we um we're reviewing a
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
application like this we asked if they
 
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
would receive Pell Grants if they're
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
going to be open to that um scrutiny
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
thanks yes um thank you I know they will
 
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
not be they are not pursuing regional
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
accreditation yet there is a process
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
with neche the regional accreditor for
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
New England and that process multi-years
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
in length so in the case of any AI they
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
will not be accepting financial aid or
 
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
Pell Grants
 
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
at this time at this time if they choose
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
to pursue regional accreditation in the
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
future then they would be that's the
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
next step right but that that's probably
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
a five-year process with the accreditor
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
so it would be quite a ways in the
 
00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:47.690 align:start position:0%
so it would be quite a ways in the
future

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:51.419 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much Mr
 
00:21:51.419 --> 00:21:52.490 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much Mr
chair

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
um why uh in this in this process
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
through granting degree granting
 
00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.270 align:start position:0%
through granting degree granting
Authority

00:21:59.270 --> 00:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
um why does this come before
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
accreditation why doesn't accreditation
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
come first and then degree granting
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
Authority would seem to be the ultimate
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
um final step
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question actually the
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
accreditors Mandate that this is the
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
first step
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
they don't want to talk to a school that
 
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:21.059 align:start position:0%
doesn't have state level approval
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
so for their process at netchi they look
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
for degree granting authority to be
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
granted locally before they will
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
consider someone for accreditation and
 
00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
that is why we have international
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
institutions such as the University of
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
Madiba or Hellenic American because they
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
had to come and get a state approval
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
before they could approach in this case
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
nechi informally me ask the regional
 
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
creditors so that it's a it's a it's
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
just the order of the steps and it's
 
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
really driven by the accreditor
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
ultimately yes yeah so thank you Mr
 
00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:54.299 align:start position:0%
chair and so have there been
 
00:22:57.649 --> 00:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
um I guess institutions where where
 
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
where the legislature has has granted
 
00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:03.539 align:start position:0%
degree granting Authority who have then
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
failed to uh to acquire the the the
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.149 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I believe so
 
00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:18.539 align:start position:0%
I spent 10 years on the higher education
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
commission and I don't recall it
 
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
happening during that time so going back
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
almost 20 years I don't recall it in
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
recent memory okay so and just so just
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that and I I'm not going
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
to get into a big Signum type of type of
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
thing but signal thank you well I think
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
was the last
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
um uh organization I see that their
 
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
presidents on on the board of directors
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
of this organization here but um but
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
just wondering have they successfully
 
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
then uh received accreditation and um
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
and and have begun uh granting degrees
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
so they are working with an accreditor
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
currently they're in the accreditation
 
00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:55.460 align:start position:0%
process again it's a multi-year
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
multi-step process
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
um typically around five years in length
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they are working through that
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
process and meeting the Milestones as
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
they go
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:13.280 align:start position:0%

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh 25.
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
24 excuse me
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
not seeing it we will close this hearing
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
and in five minutes we will start the
 
00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:23.990 align:start position:0%
and in five minutes we will start the
next

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%

that's the next two Wednesdays
 
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think we're going to be
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
scheduling here at that time okay yeah
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%

and for the committee members here in
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
the public we are now going into the
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate bill 215. this is
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
relative to nursing certification
 
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.990 align:start position:0%
relative to nursing certification
requirements

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to welcome
 
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
Senator Lou dalessandro
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman that
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
it's an array of characters I see yeah
 
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
yeah right in front of us a wonderful
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
group I want to tell you that in 1872 I
 
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
was elected to the to the House of
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
Representatives and I served on the
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
committee on education but that was my
 
00:30:12.649 --> 00:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
first assignment and it was a completely
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
unique experience for me you know being
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
my first time as as a legislator and it
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
was a great committee and I don't know
 
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
if they still have it the business year
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
but we had our end of the session party
 
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
for the committee which I thought was a
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
great camaraderie and great
 
00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
relationships are established in the
 
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
legislature and it was always a good
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
idea so first of all thanks so much for
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
allowing me to come before you to speak
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
on blank on my legislation it's a
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
privilege to be here and uh thank you so
 
00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:45.539 align:start position:0%
much for taking the time
 
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
the bill is is a very simple one
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's an important bill at the right time
 
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
and I must say that out of full
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
disclosure my daughter-in-law is a
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
school nurse she's the school nurse at
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
Cochran high school and prior to that
 
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
was a school nurse at Pittsfield High
 
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.830 align:start position:0%
was a school nurse at Pittsfield High
School

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
School
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
as writtenly as recently as last year a
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
school could hire a school nurse with an
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
associate's degree in nursing if the
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
nurse goes out to complete a bachelor's
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
program within six years of the date of
 
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.090 align:start position:0%
program within six years of the date of
hire

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
hire
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
however given the third set of the
 
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:22.820 align:start position:0%
current law this ended on July 1st 2002
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
2022. this bill reinstates this
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
important pathway that was previously
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
available to School nurses in schools
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
hiring nurses during a time of events
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
Workforce pressure at a nursing shortage
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 215 is the result of nurses
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
in Manchester who first brought this to
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
my attention working together with the
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school Nurses Association
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
and I might say that all of the parties
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
were in concert with regard to this
 
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation all of the parties
 
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
we brought them together and they came
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
up with a with the right solution
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
it allows schools to hire school nurse
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
holding an associate's degree but still
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
recognizes the continuing importance of
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
the bachelor's degree
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
this is because school nursing is now a
 
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
high specialty in nursing the knowledge
 
00:32:15.409 --> 00:32:15.419 align:start position:0%
base you need is very expensive it
 
00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
continues to grow and evolve
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
this is also consistent with the current
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
practice in acute care settings which
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
advertise BSN prefer it in other words
 
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
nurses hide without a BSN are simply
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
required to enroll in a bachelor's
 
00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.510 align:start position:0%
required to enroll in a bachelor's
program

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
but again this bill also reflects
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
Workforce realities this is why August
 
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
25th 2019 is included is included is
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
because uh different requirements Supply
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
to nurses had already before August 21st
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
2019. this is a reasonable approach that
 
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
protects our school children as all of
 
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539 align:start position:0%
us know uh
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
School nursing has become a very very
 
00:32:59.930 --> 00:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
very difficult job and I can tell you
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
that out of personal experience my my
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law goes in at eight in the
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
morning and is busy until the closing of
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
school on a daily basis and they are
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
really required
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh to do a lot more than they just
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
talked to an individual student thing
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very very difficult job a
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
lot of pressure and uh
 
00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
this bill takes care of a problem it
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
allows us to move forward it retains to
 
00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
be I said it it it allows us uh like in
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester to have arids it
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
gives them an opportunity to get the BSF
 
00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
so Mr but with that I would appreciate
 
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
your support of this piece of
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
legislation as it's good for for New
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's good for the schools and
 
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
it's good for the nurses thank you thank
 
00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:49.019 align:start position:0%
you very much Senator D'Alessandro are
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
there questions for the senator
 
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hall thank you Mr
 
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:33:57.649 --> 00:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
question thank you for being here
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
Senator I'm just curious so it expired
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
in July of 22.
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
um do we know what percentage of
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
associate degree nurses actually went on
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
to get their bachelor's
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh that's great great question I don't
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
have those stats but I believe that
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
somebody must have them I don't have the
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
before lead but I I would think that the
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
the pressure to get a BSN is really
 
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
it's really existed and people are
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
moving in that in that direction and we
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
got some very very super BSN programs
 
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire today is office a
 
00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:33.419 align:start position:0%
wonderful BSN program I think Rivier
 
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
University and of course the University
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh office and we
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
expanded our capacity at the University
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire by 50 students were
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to get 50 more so I'm sure that
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
that process is moving uh in a rapid
 
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
Direction I put okay thank you for
 
00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:53.099 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you you're
 
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
welcome supporting skilled nurses thank
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
you representative Damon
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
I do have a question I want to also just
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
add to your list of institutions in the
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
state offering RN programs Colby SAR
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
college and River Valley Community
 
00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:06.770 align:start position:0%
college and River Valley Community
College

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
College
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
um and Colby sorry does the BSN program
 
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:14.180 align:start position:0%
my question is where the basis of the
 
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
six-year time frame other than the
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
pre-existing law it seems like a long
 
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.170 align:start position:0%
pre-existing law it seems like a long
time

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
it's their
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
any explanation of why it's that long to
 
00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:28.339 align:start position:0%
get into the bachelor's I I think
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
others could give you testimony as to
 
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
why why that's why that was probably I
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
think it wasn't a combination
 
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh it it seemed it seems to be and I do
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that Colby soya has
 
00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
a has a program they're working in
 
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:45.060 align:start position:0%
conjunction with Hitchcock that was
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock in that it just shows you the
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
dramatic need we have for nurses I mean
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very it's it's one of the
 
00:35:57.119 --> 00:35:57.829 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very it's it's one of the
real

00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
real
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
problems that we have in our in our
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
schools not only do we need
 
00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
be nurses but we we also need social
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
workers to be honest with you that the
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
nurses are being uh being asked to do
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
all of that work at the present time and
 
00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.339 align:start position:0%
that's way that's Way Beyond what they
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
were what they brought out for just a
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
few years ago we put a four-year degree
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
program in the PSU as well and that
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
program is overloaded with applications
 
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:25.740 align:start position:0%
there's just so many seats available
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
that's the problem
 
00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:30.950 align:start position:0%
that's the problem
represents

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for taking my question
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with the program the
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
nursing program at saying he's because I
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
I taught there and had some of the
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
nurses for my students
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
and it's a very rigorous full-time
 
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
program and so I've imagined the others
 
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
are too I'm just left wondering how a
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
nurse at a school working at a school
 
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
would be able to
 
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
um go to a program like that or uh just
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
a concern I don't know if you have any
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
feedback on that okay
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
could you kind of explain to me what
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
you're what you're query my question is
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
that the so you have a nurse at a school
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
working at a school with an Associate
 
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
who then has to get a bachelor's degree
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
in six years but how
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
I know that some of these programs I'm
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with was
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
so regimented their schedule like how I
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
none of them had jobs outside so are
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
there other programs that would address
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
this I don't see how they'd be able to a
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
program like that which I don't know if
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
Riviera's like that but how with the
 
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:35.060 align:start position:0%
logistics of this work of them getting
 
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
into a program and balancing it the
 
00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
education with their job yeah good point
 
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
it's a really good point and I know the
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
the program at St a is as rigorous and
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
it's quite it's called Pac that it and
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
they don't have an extension program
 
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
which is a a little bit problematic I
 
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
taught at CDs for a number of years so I
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
I could tell you that I appreciate the
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
nurses there but it's it's not easy it's
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
not easy you have to find a place that
 
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
oftens the courses it does it to move
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
forward so you know that could it's
 
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
that's it's an emphasis of the value of
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
continuing education and how important
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
it is that uh programs are are available
 
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.770 align:start position:0%
it is that uh programs are are available
that

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
people can access don't know don't know
 
00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
the full type basis but on a part-time
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
basis it could could get their degree
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
further questions just represent
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you and good morning good
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
morning this bill has a fiscal note but
 
00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
then turning to the fiscal note it says
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
this bill will have no impact on revenue
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
or expenditures so why is our fiscal
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
note thank you very much for the
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
question I know sometimes we ask for
 
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes because it's uh unclear but
 
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
that this has no physical impact at all
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
all right thank you you're welcome
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
yeah the fiscal note issue is an issue
 
00:38:59.810 --> 00:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
right that's an issue there's no money
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
in it at all right right you know later
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
there he needs to be money in it but uh
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
represent Allison oh thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for being here Senator I'll
 
00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:11.579 align:start position:0%
see you thank you uh a question about
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
capacity and I guess that goes back to
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
the question around
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
how many people do we have who have
 
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
Associates degrees who now would be
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
covered under this I mean all the
 
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
programs I'm familiar with are packed as
 
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:29.180 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact the little story that
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
valedictorian from Dover High School uh
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
was not accepted in the nursing program
 
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
UNH because she didn't have a high
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
enough grade point average and that's a
 
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
very competitive if we have significant
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
numbers of people right how where are
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
they going to go and how are they going
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
to get in I guess that's my question
 
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
well it's a great question and I think
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
let me let me try to give you an answer
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
that that it boggles my mind we had a
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
wonderful nursing program at New
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital that we discontinued
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
it we actually trade psychiatric nurses
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital there's a
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
tremendous debate for psychiatric nurses
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
but all of a sudden we don't have any
 
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.810 align:start position:0%
but all of a sudden we don't have any
programs

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
every hospital this state
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
used to have a nurses program
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
I remember Elliot's program I I think
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
maybe Sacred Heart and Notre Dame had
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
this well he discontinued those programs
 
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
out of out of I think
 
00:40:31.609 --> 00:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
maybe it was an economic issue and as a
 
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
result we we have the Genesis we're the
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
creation of our own problem
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
and as a as a result of this we'll we've
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
got to build and uh we've got to get
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
things going now we did great this
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
legislation did great work when we gave
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire
 
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
additional funds
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
to create 50 boy slots for nurses now
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
that's that that's that's a step forward
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
and that program is highly competitive
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're exactly right it's highly
 
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.470 align:start position:0%
you're you're exactly right it's highly
competitive

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
even outstanding students outstanding
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
students every competition with one
 
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
another they can't get in
 
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
the time to expand the nursing programs
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
is here uh it uh we've got to do board
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
now Saint Joseph's instituted an
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
associate degree program in nursing a
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
few years ago St Joseph's Hospital
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
and that again that was part of a of a
 
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
situation where they discontinued a
 
00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:32.579 align:start position:0%
program it would have been reinstated
 
00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
that reinstated it because of the the
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
demonstrated the
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh but but but clearly uh the the needs
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
they we need spaces and we got to think
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
about we have to think about that
 
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome we have we have
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
a number of pink cards here from The
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%

from various organizations
 
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
every one of these cards is in support
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
so if we have some technical questions
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
that are specific to the Nurses
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
Association we have folks here that can
 
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
answer those for us hopefully
 
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:07.380 align:start position:0%

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
Health coordinator and I'm here in
 
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
support of chief of the billstone field
 
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
215 as it's been amended
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
it's been around the school district
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
into high University including associate
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
degree into the division of the nurse
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
achieves yes
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
press the silver button
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
is that better that's better thank you
 
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.849 align:start position:0%
is that better that's better thank you
sorry

00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:49.859 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
um uh and the reason we use the six
 
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
years is because it's two certification
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
cycles and for some of our nurses trying
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
to go back to school it does take a
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
while to go uh while you're working so I
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
hope that answers that question for you
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
this does give the school district the
 
00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility to find and hire a nurse
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
with the assurance that the nurse will
 
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
be achieving the skills in education
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
essential for this specialty practice of
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
school nursing
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
today's school nurse is working in a
 
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
very fast-paced multi-discipline setting
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
responsible for meeting the needs of all
 
00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
children including the increased number
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
of students with multiple complex
 
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
physical and mental health issues this
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
requires the nurse to have strong skills
 
00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:33.020 align:start position:0%
in clinical care and critical thinking
 
00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
advocacy leadership and the ability to
 
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
match your practice to the ever-changing
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
evidence as new research emerges this
 
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
means not only can the nurse provide
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
immediate and care and procedures for
 
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
students with asthma with seizure
 
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
disorders with anaphylaxis and multiple
 
00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:53.099 align:start position:0%
physical conditions but also includes
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
the planning with School staff

excellent School nurses for our students

nursing across all practice areas as a
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
matter of fact some of our local
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
surrounding states are now require a
 
00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:18.260 align:start position:0%
master's degree for School nurses
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
the importance of qualified School
 
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
nurses was no more imperative than it
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
was during the past few years with the
 
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
pandemic and our communities really do
 
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
need to be assured that all School
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
nurses can provide the quality nursing
 
00:46:31.609 --> 00:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
services that our students and schools
 
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
deserve thank you thank you very much
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
are there questions yes represent Tanner
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
and representative Iowa thank you I want
 
00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
to thank you and all the School nurses
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for the effort you've
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
put through through covid and after
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
covid trying to get these kids to you
 
00:46:53.569 --> 00:46:53.579 align:start position:0%
know get back in school and stay in
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
school it's really been important I'd
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
like you to speak a little bit about
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
um the role of the school nurse
 
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
particularly in our rural areas how
 
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
they're they're dealing a little bit
 
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
differently than perhaps the nurses in
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Nashua where hospitals
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
and doctors are readily available
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
school nurse is frequently the primary
 
00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:20.099 align:start position:0%
Person Medical person that families and
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
children actually see so they're the
 
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
ones who actually do triage as to what
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
kind of Health Care that we might have
 
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
to have plus they've had the connections
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
with the health care facilities that may
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
be surrounding and making sure that we
 
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
have those uh students with a clear path
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
to get to this need the help the care
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
that they need so yeah it's different
 
00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
thank you represent miler
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
well thank you for being here it's
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
always nice to see you hi Mel
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
um a question I guess one I have we've
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
we've had the issue of Licensing of
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
nurses before this committee before
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
and there is always a hesitation of
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
watering down the qualifications to
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
become a school nurse my sense is is
 
00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
that based upon your testimony you feel
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
that this is not a watering down but
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's basically trying to address the
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
particular needs so that's my first
 
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
question the second question if you
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
could outline for the committee
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
um based upon your years of experience
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
as a school nurse how has it changed
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
what you know when you came in to be a
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
school nurse years ago to what the
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
actual responsibilities are what has
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
been some of the changes that have taken
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
place so those two questions if you
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
could answer those thank you okay
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
um the certification itself is
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
definitely something that will make sure
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
that there's a guarantee because we've
 
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
now established some specific skills
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to have
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
what's changed is I started my career as
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
an emergency room nurse and I thought I
 
00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
was golden walking through the door but
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
the problems aren't just first aid they
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
aren't just I'm recognizing a hot
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
appendix or recognizing a broken bone is
 
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
really looking at this all the social
 
00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
determinants of Health that we have that
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
impact this child coming to school can
 
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
they sleep do they eat can they
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
um do they have health issues that are
 
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
related to mental health issues
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
um so that's kind of what's changed
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
um and it's important to realize that
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
the school nurse is part of a team if we
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
work with our social workers we work
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
with our school guidance counselors and
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
we work with teachers as well as our
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
school administrators is really a lot
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
more complicated the other issue we have
 
00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:36.500 align:start position:0%
is we have children that are that are
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
recovering from being in a NICU and they
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
usually have some kind of sequela which
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
would mean they may very well have
 
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
seizure disorders they may have
 
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
developmental issues I now we have to do
 
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
catheterizations in school I have to do
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
colostomy care I have to do tracheostomy
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
care so it's a lot more complicated than
 
00:49:59.930 --> 00:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
um certainly the first days that I was a
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
school nurse
 
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
yes representing portiello
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question and it's similar to
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
the one I asked the senator so perhaps
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
you have more familiarity with where
 
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
will these nurses who are working at
 
00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
these schools uh where will they go for
 
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
this education a lot of these programs
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
like I mentioned I was feeling I'm
 
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
familiar with with one of them a very
 
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
rigorous full-time so how will you
 
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
accommodate the need for for the
 
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
education there are multiple programs
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
and even in the state and there are also
 
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
some there online with as appropriate
 
00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:41.579 align:start position:0%
clinical assignments as well that are
 
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
planned so School nurses can do that I
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
personally went back to school for nurse
 
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
practitioner as I was working full-time
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
so it can be done
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
um so like Granite State College has a
 
00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:55.700 align:start position:0%
good program it takes you know the
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
associate degree nurse and and has
 
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
coursework it's one of the reasons we
 
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
looked at two certification Cycles which
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
would be the six years because
 
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
um if you're working and you're working
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
in particularly if you're a working
 
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
parent it's really difficult to get in
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
all of those credit hours in a very
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
short period of time so that's kind of
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
where this but there's several programs
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
around so
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
yes represent dry
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question just to follow up on
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
life happens what happens if it's six
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
years you're not done
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't have an answer for that
 
00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:36.059 align:start position:0%
um uh that would be the decision of the
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed in terms of continuing
 
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question as
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
a former nurse myself I know we've been
 
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
working long and hard encouraging nurses
 
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
to achieve their bachelor's degree I
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
mean it's been 30 years since I
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
graduated and we're still having us the
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
same conversation
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
um do you think six years is long enough
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
how many associate degree nurses do we
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
have actually working as School nurses
 
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
and will we achieve this goal in six
 
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.930 align:start position:0%
and will we achieve this goal in six
years

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
it helps number one I hope so
 
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
um I do not have the number of how many
 
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
nurses we have that are associate
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
degrees versus that but we can get that
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
information for you
 
00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
um right now I think we have more
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
Baccalaureate nurses than we have
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
associate degree nurses and we kind of
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
looking at this because we're having
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
studied to have a nursing shortage we
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
want to get ahead of it so
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent Allison
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
question I want to piggyback on the the
 
00:52:47.329 --> 00:52:47.339 align:start position:0%
issue of how many somebody's got to know
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
how about how many
 
00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
nurses or associate nurses are working
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
now that would then come under the the
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
new legislation and that becomes
 
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
important I think from my perspective
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
because we got a bottleneck if there are
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
100 associate nurses out there who are
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
Associates and they all have to get a ba
 
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
within six years in almost all of the
 
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
programs in the state have an acceptance
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
rate of about five to ten percent with a
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
90 rejection rate where do these what
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
are the applications for these people
 
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
follow let alone
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
having the capacity there how do they
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
what you know how do you determine
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
whether this school nurse goes to the
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
top of the list ahead of everybody else
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
or in the middle I mean they're just
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
questions I think about implementation I
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's a great build I just think
 
00:53:41.049 --> 00:53:41.059 align:start position:0%
that that in my mind
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
capacity is really huge here and I
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
understand how much time was spent and
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
effort was spent adding 50 slots to UNH
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
but if we're talking about significant
 
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
numbers of people here that there's a
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
there's an issue that has to be dealt
 
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
with that's all that's a good question
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to remember
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
that most of our nurses and across the
 
00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:03.300 align:start position:0%
state have already been grandfathered or
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
already been certified so this is for
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.849 --> 00:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
uh represent Cornell thank you thank you
 
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so when you said
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
grandfather that it says all School
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
nurses hired after August 2019 2019. so
 
00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
if they were hired before that they're
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
all set if they were grandfathers okay
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay we have a
 
00:54:29.569 --> 00:54:29.579 align:start position:0%
number of others that I want to come out
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
and testify too on this bill
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
um so and we do have the department here
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
as well and some of those questions uh
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
you know that art just mentioned might
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
be Hansel there if not we can go right
 
00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
to the colleges themselves and go to the
 
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
nursing programs and get that response
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chair Ladd I
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak and
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to thank this committee I
 
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
know that this Committee in particular
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
has done a Herculean amount of work this
 
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh this year so far and I was very
 
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:15.300 align:start position:0%
impressed by how much went through the
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
house last week and I just wanted to say
 
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for all the work because I
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
know it's a lot
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Sean Parr I'm on the
 
00:55:23.809 --> 00:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
Manchester School Board where I sit on
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
the policy committee and chair the
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
education legislation committee today
 
00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:29.099 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking on behalf of the Manchester
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
School Board which has authorized me to
 
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
advocate in support of allowing school
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
districts to hire School nurses with an
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
associate's degree as you heard pursuant
 
00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
to changes in this law that took effect
 
00:55:43.609 --> 00:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
on July 1st 2022 the Manchester school
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
district is no longer able to hire
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
nurses with an associate's degree in
 
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
nursing into a school nurse 1 position
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
as outlined in the New Hampshire
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
education regulations the current
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
version of RSA 200.29 requires the
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
district to hire new School nurses with
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
a bachelor's degree which effectively
 
00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:03.380 align:start position:0%
nullifies our school nurse 1 position
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
the district has many valued School
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
nurses that were grandfathered under an
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
older version of the law and that
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
provide excellent care to our students
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the district is already experiencing
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
great difficulty in hiring School nurses
 
00:56:15.119 --> 00:56:16.210 align:start position:0%
great difficulty in hiring School nurses
now

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:16.220 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
sb215 will allow us to consider
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
applicants with associates degree and
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
will better enable us to remain police
 
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
staffed with a team of School nurses
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
across our 21 schools let me ask for
 
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
your support of this bill and thank you
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
very much for your consideration
 
00:56:34.609 --> 00:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
I do have a question for you Sean um has
 
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
the Manchester School District had to
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
get into the business of contracted
 
00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
services for various agencies to provide
 
00:56:44.809 --> 00:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
further questions representative parano
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question what is a school
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
nurse one position assuming there's
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
different levels sure so the school
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
nurse one position was that the
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
associates level school nurse position
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
there and so that's what we cannot hire
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
for we had a slot for that as a as one
 
00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
type of hire that could could be done
 
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
within the district there and so above
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
that would be the bachelor's level nurse
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
school nurse 2 Etc yeah
 
00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
yes representative Damon
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm actually
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
following up on your question so
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the need to use contract nurses I'm
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
asking you to State the obvious what's
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
the cost impact of that I I'm not sure I
 
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
have the exact cost impact but it is
 
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
much more expensive yes and it is it is
 
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
a big burden for our district there's no
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
doubt there's no doubt I think we're at
 
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
the on the order of seven or eight
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
nurses in that category if I remember
 
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.390 align:start position:0%
nurses in that category if I remember
correctly

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.970 align:start position:0%
correctly
yes

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:45.980 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
so if it's seven or eight out of 21
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
schools that each have at least one
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
nursing position you're telling us that
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
a third or so our contract members we do
 
00:57:59.089 --> 00:57:59.099 align:start position:0%
need to hire School nurses yes yeah yeah
 
00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
that's happening all over the state
 
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative Hall
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you think you've
 
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
taken my question uh is there any in
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
your school district is there any
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the progress that these
 
00:58:12.049 --> 00:58:12.059 align:start position:0%
nurses are making so that all of a
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
sudden year six you know it's like oh
 
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
gosh I'm not going to be able to do it I
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
mean is there a mentoring
 
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
support system for these nurses I
 
00:58:24.049 --> 00:58:24.059 align:start position:0%
believe there is support uh I'm I'm not
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
aware of a monitoring at this point
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
there uh so this will be for new hires
 
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
they're since 2019 there and I'm not I'm
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
not I don't have that number for you in
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
terms of how many we have in that
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
category that would need to be monitored
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure they finish within six
 
00:58:37.559 --> 00:58:38.450 align:start position:0%
to make sure they finish within six
years

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
question it's kind of big
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
have you you you have had
 
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
um associates degree nurses in the past
 
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
in your school and we still do and you
 
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
still do do they do a fine job if you
 
00:59:08.930 --> 00:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
had any problems with them no no
 
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
problems they're excellent is there a
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
reason then that they need to get their
 
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
bachelor's if they're doing fine with
 
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
the associates
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
well I think that refers to the kind of
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
30-year process that's been referred to
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
a couple times that there's been an urge
 
00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:27.380 align:start position:0%
to uh have nurses have that bachelor's
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
credential there and I'm afraid I can't
 
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
speak to the history of that as well as
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
perhaps those behind me there but but
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
from your experience
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
from my experience the nurses have them
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
as a July 1st 2022 all School nurses
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
hired in the state of New Hampshire must
 
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
have a bachelor's degree or higher and
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
be certified through the Department of
 
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
Education while the state does not
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
require School nurses to be schools to
 
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
be staffed with nurses is of course
 
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
preferred to having an administrator
 
00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
with little or no medical experience
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
and especially with the increase in
 
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
complex medical needs of students the
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
trouble is school districts are
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
struggling to hire nurses in the
 
01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:06.299 align:start position:0%
requirement of a bachelor's degree is a
 
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
contributing factor to that problem
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
I believe that the original law was well
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
intentioned but misguided for a
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
multitude of reasons and I believe my
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
person as part of my research I reviewed
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
the NCLEX Pass rates from 2014 to 2021.
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
for those who may not know that's a
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
national exam for those who wish to work
 
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
as a nurse associate and bachelor's
 
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
programs in New Hampshire are equivalent
 
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
regarding their Pass rates over the
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
eight-year span with associate degree
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
programs averaging a total 92.47 pass
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
rate and bachelor's programs totaling an
 
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
average 91.51 pass rate this indicates
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
statistically no difference in the
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
quality of nurses coming out of each
 
01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.870 align:start position:0%
quality of nurses coming out of each
program

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
I also believe that the law as is can
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
have unforeseen consequences of being
 
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:47.339 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against many in society
 
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
such as single parents and those who
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
live in low-income areas or come from
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
low-income families who cannot afford
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
the tuition to a school with a
 
01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:55.140 align:start position:0%
bachelor's program
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
some will say that my advocacy financial
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
literacy and research abilities are
 
01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
proof of the benefits of requiring
 
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
nurses to obtain a bachelor's degree I
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
must respectfully disagree on the
 
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
grounds that these individuals did not
 
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
know me prior to my being enrolled for
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
my bachelor's including my many years of
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
advocacy and fundraising for the Youth
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
of Manchester through non-profits into
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
the shortage a lot of work is available
 
01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
to negotiate their starting step and
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
somebody coming in say with a bachelor's
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
degree could could argue that you should
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
stop me at step five uh some like that
 
01:01:26.809 --> 01:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
Luna thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Durkin for uh for
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
your testimony this morning I know
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's probably others um that may
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
follow that that may be in position
 
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
answer this question as well but but but
 
01:01:42.049 --> 01:01:42.059 align:start position:0%
I think you you may be as well I think
 
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:44.339 align:start position:0%
first it would it would sort of wrap a
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
question about Statewide how many
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
positions are are unfilled but but I
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
want to tie it to a comment you you you
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
made which is you appreciated the
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
Senate's quick action on this we've got
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
about two two and a half months left of
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
the um of the school year
 
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
um would would quick action be able to
 
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
to have any impact on on school
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
districts and their students
 
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
um in what's left of uh of the school
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
year and how could you quantify that uh
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question and I I I I
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
I guess the way it may be able to help
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
is you we are coming up you know also to
 
01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
the end of the the school year too so
 
01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:32.900 align:start position:0%
the sooner this legislation is in place
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh the sooner they can start acting on
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
hiring even not for this year but for
 
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
next year a lot of School departments do
 
01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:42.059 align:start position:0%
their hiring at the end of the school
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
year or the start date for September uh
 
01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:47.780 align:start position:0%
so the sooner the better definitely
 
01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I know you're from the Mass
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
area yes sir um are we in competition
 
01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
with what's going on with schools down
 
01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
just over the line folks live on either
 
01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
side and they go back and forth for work
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
are we seeing some of our nurses going
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts due to the fact that
 
01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
they may be paying you know a person
 
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:11.579 align:start position:0%
with a bachelor's more than 30 bucks an
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
hour or something such as that I I don't
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
have any hard figures on that but I'm
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
sure I'm sure you are sure it is
 
01:03:22.849 --> 01:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
definitely a employee's market right now
 
01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:26.579 align:start position:0%
and you know going back to the uh even
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
within Massachusetts there is in uh
 
01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
wages that are being offered I'll go
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
back to the example of my sister and
 
01:03:35.809 --> 01:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
Lowell where they had over the past
 
01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
couple of years had lost about 10 nurses
 
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
to other Massachusetts school districts
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
because the wage levels were so low and
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
we've since been able to address that
 
01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
and get them up to speed but the up to
 
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
par but the the damage was done in that
 
01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:53.339 align:start position:0%
City anyway
 
01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions not seeing
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
any thank you very much thank you uh I'd
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
like to invite Paula and address some of
 
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
the things that have already been
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
brought up uh thank you for having me
 
01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:05.579 align:start position:0%
here today
 
01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
um it's a pleasure to see you all
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
and I'll be very brief in my own
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the New Hampshire school
 
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association supports the
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
amendment to SB 215 the amendment is
 
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
what will allow school districts to hire
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
Associates prepared nurses with a
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
condition that they enroll in a bachelor
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
of nursing program and complete it
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
within six years this should immediately
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
increase the number of nurses available
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
to interview for school nursing
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
positions and we know that the nursing
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
shortage is here to stay for the
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
immediate future we hope that you will
 
01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
pass this bill as it was amended
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
now there are several other points that
 
01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
I would like to bring up after hearing
 
01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
other people testify
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
there was a question about who is
 
01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
following these nurses
 
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
and being sure that they are meeting the
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
criteria and and a simple answer to that
 
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
is the certification board for the
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Education every school
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
district should be monitoring the
 
01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:14.839 align:start position:0%
continuing education that a nurse takes
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
and applying that toward their
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
certification board when their renewal
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
comes up it's actually each School
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
District that then approves the person
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
for the certification board the
 
01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:32.780 align:start position:0%
um question came up about not enough
 
01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:36.020 align:start position:0%
bachelor's nursing programs in the state
 
01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
we do a pretty good job of connecting
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
our School nurses at our conferences
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
with many many online programs who are
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
scrambling to get these nurses enrolled
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
into their program for example we have
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
Elms College who will be at our
 
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
conference this Saturday and nurses will
 
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
have a chance to talk to them about
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
their online programs these online
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
schools are in regular touch with us
 
01:06:05.569 --> 01:06:05.579 align:start position:0%
they are very aware that New Hampshire
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
has recently passed the caveat that
 
01:06:11.569 --> 01:06:11.579 align:start position:0%
their Associate's degrees nurses must
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
continue in their education and they're
 
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
scrambling to get the business so to
 
01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:18.910 align:start position:0%
scrambling to get the business so to
speak

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
person that spoke from the Manchester
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
School Board I hopefully I have answered
 
01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
the question of who's monitoring these
 
01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
School nurses
 
01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.829 align:start position:0%
School nurses
um

01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
let's see let's address uh Manchester
 
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
struggling to hire and we do know from
 
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
past history and we do know from a very
 
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
comprehensive salary survey that our
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
association has done that Manchester is
 
01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
far below unfortunately other school
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
districts so Manchester is losing their
 
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
nurses to other school districts are
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
they crossing the border into
 
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:01.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts possibly Massachusetts
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
requires a bachelor's upon hire and has
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
for quite some time and they encourage
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
all of their School nurses to then go on
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
and get their masters
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
the pay in Massachusetts yes I I live in
 
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
a Border Town I've looked into it many
 
01:07:20.809 --> 01:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
times and in fact worked part-time for
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
one of their uh school districts during
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
the summer which paid significantly more
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
A continuing education once these nurses
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh are in a bachelor's program the fact
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
that they're in that bachelor's program
 
01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
does count toward their continuing
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
education and the continuing education
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
that they have to complete for their
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
nursing license is 30 hours every two
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
years the certification board at the doe
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
requires 15 hours
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
every year so they can use their
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
continuing ed for both of those
 
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:06.770 align:start position:0%
continuing ed for both of those
um

01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
mandates that they must meet so there's
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
no additional continuing education that
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
they have to be meet in order to keep
 
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
their certification it's the same hours
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
that they would have had for their
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
license and the nice part about that is
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
that the oplc and the Board of Nursing
 
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
does no tracking of uh continuing
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
education hours now we've got the school
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
districts who through the certification
 
01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:34.259 align:start position:0%
board should care about the continuing
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
education of their nurses and be
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring that just like they do their
 
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.970 align:start position:0%
monitoring that just like they do their
teachers

01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh do we need quick action uh on passing
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
this bill absolutely because school
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
districts are looking and hiring now uh
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
for next school year we have uh
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
currently eight uh nurses who have
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
reported someone who's retiring as far
 
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
as schools that are without a nurse we
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
still do know that Hinsdale has been
 
01:09:07.809 --> 01:09:07.819 align:start position:0%
without a nurse all year
 
01:09:12.370 --> 01:09:12.380 align:start position:0%
and the nurse that was in that position
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh reports to me that she had to leave
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
the position because of low pay she just
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
couldn't make ends meetings a single
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
mother you know bringing up her kids she
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
feels very bad thank you and thank you
 
01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
again to all the School nurses for all
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
they've been doing you know over coveted
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
and afterwards we know that and we've
 
01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
heard that both Associates and Bachelors
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
take the same RN exam and and are both
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
highly qualified to be nurses could you
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit to the specialty of
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
of school nursing
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
that means over and above the
 
01:09:52.849 --> 01:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
associate's degree or maybe it doesn't
 
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
so could that's one of the questions
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
that we've had yeah let's look for
 
01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
example the associate degree nurse yes
 
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
they take the same uh test and they pass
 
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
the same test it allows them entry into
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
the nursing profession so if they go to
 
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
work in a hospital and decide that the
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
oncology unit that they rotated through
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
during their Nursing
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
education if they decide that I want to
 
01:10:22.689 --> 01:10:22.699 align:start position:0%
be an oncology nurse they take more
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
courses they take more courses there's
 
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
actually a certification in oncology
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
nursing that they can get through the
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
American Nurses Association if they so
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
choose many many hospitals will set up
 
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
someone to help nurses with what what
 
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
continuing education do you need for us
 
01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
to call you an oncology nurse and to
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
move you up the ranks so the same in in
 
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
school nursing although the
 
01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
certification Department did not want to
 
01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
get involved in developing courses for
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
school nursing we do have
 
01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.810 align:start position:0%
school nursing we do have
um

01:10:58.810 --> 01:10:58.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
there is a national certification that
 
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
they can take through the national board
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
of certification for School nurses but
 
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
that's not being required uh there are
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
elms college has developed a master's in
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
school nursing just for the School
 
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
nurses of New Hampshire and they'll be
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
implementing that this this school year
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
for the nurses that want to move up but
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
do they need uh and want further
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
education they absolutely should and and
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
we would hope that the school districts
 
01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
would take those nurses under their
 
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
wings and say you know we'd like to see
 
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
you take some college courses in public
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
health or this Arena or that Arena
 
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
because the um since inclusion happened
 
01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
which has been many many years the role
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
of the school nurse just keeps expanding
 
01:11:51.169 --> 01:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
and expanding and we talk to our school
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
nurses we'd like them to be leaders
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
within the school because Administration
 
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what they don't know and
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
they need to be at the table and speak
 
01:12:03.169 --> 01:12:03.179 align:start position:0%
up and say we'd like to see this or you
 
01:12:05.209 --> 01:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
know I've got some resources I can bring
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
in a vaccination clinic if that's what
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
you want I've got some resources that I
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
can bring in for your teachers for
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
continuing education they need to know
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
more about diabetes they need to know
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
more about the health situations that
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
are going to affect a child's learning
 
01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:23.900 align:start position:0%
so they really are a liaison between
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
the parent the school the teachers the
 
01:12:27.659 --> 01:12:29.390 align:start position:0%
the parent the school the teachers the
administration

01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.290 align:start position:0%
administration
um

01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a specialty practice for
 
01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:35.699 align:start position:0%
sure we do have several more pink cards
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
here so are there any yes representative
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um uh Ms McKinnon
 
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
for uh for being here again for for uh
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
for these bills and um and I I and also
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
I I would thank you and everybody I
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
think for a very good a well done
 
01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort I think it's great
 
01:12:58.669 --> 01:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
when we see legislation coming forward
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
that's built this way that clearly moves
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
things forward for all the grant all
 
01:13:05.209 --> 01:13:05.219 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
um but I wanna I'm and I you I'm
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
thinking you may be the right person
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
asked there may be others that that that
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
could help answer this but I want to
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
sort of take this more through an
 
01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.169 align:start position:0%
sort of take this more through an
operational

01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
operational
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
um question I was on a school board for
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
12 years and um and so I certainly saw a
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
lot of collective bargaining agreements
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
and and things like that and and um and
 
01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
from time to time the superintendent
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
would uh would would
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
um be in a position where where they
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
needed to hire let's say a teacher with
 
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
an ALT certificate or something that
 
01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
didn't quite fit the
 
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
um the normal practice but I'm wondering
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
with with
 
01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
um with certainly many collective
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements in place right now
 
01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
that may not have an Associates track
 
01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
um on them is there is there a means for
 
01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
a superintendent to to hire an associate
 
01:14:04.729 --> 01:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
level nurse and and have them on or off
 
01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
the um the collective bargaining
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
agreement or is there additional
 
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that would need to be sort
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
of taken up in conjunction with this to
 
01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
provide that sort of emergency
 
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
um of capability until uh either the the
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
CBA could be reopened or renegotiated
 
01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
okay when we did our salary survey we
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
looked at every single contract in the
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
state and specifically we looked for its
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
recognition clause and in the vast
 
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
majority of
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
um of contracts that we looked at the
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
nurses were recognized in that clause
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
which then meant that they were under
 
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
the teacher contract that does not mean
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
that they had to be paid as a teacher
 
01:14:55.729 --> 01:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
and we found about
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
15 percent of the nurses across the
 
01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:02.420 align:start position:0%
state were in a separate
 
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
pay category but we have found since the
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
legislation in 2016 and certification
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
came on board that many nurses
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
renegotiated those contracts and got put
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
on teacher pay at the bachelor level
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yeah so
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
so partially in the in this case you
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
know the the the nurse may be coming on
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
an associate's level working towards a
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
bachelor's level and and I'm just
 
01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
wondering in the in these collective
 
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements that you've
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
reviewed if and and in Hopkinton where I
 
01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
was on the board the the nurses were
 
01:15:41.810 --> 01:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
um I think this English like whatever
 
01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:46.020 align:start position:0%
electives you have to take to us I'm not
 
01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:48.140 align:start position:0%
familiar with all of them and
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
professionalism in nursing I think is
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
one of them sometimes there's a there's
 
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.510 align:start position:0%
one of them sometimes there's a there's
a

01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
like different roles that nurses can
 
01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.250 align:start position:0%
like different roles that nurses can
have

01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
it's a you know varied thank you
 
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you the last
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
card which we have is Steve Appley from
 
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
um we have a a number of other
 
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
communities are looking at shortage
 
01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
shortage teachers we're looking at the
 
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
higher education committee to looking at
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
prep teacher preparation institutions as
 
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
well as teacher preparation institutions
 
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
here in the state but Steve I do have
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
one question for you that's come to my
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
obviously there has to be some way of
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
you know like we have the higher
 
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
education commission here which we've
 
01:16:43.370 --> 01:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
talked about you know you know we
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
authorize but they're approved by the
 
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
higher commission you know to function
 
01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
as a four-year institution in our state
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh well how are we certifying or
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
this online program is
 
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
cutting the mustard
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh chair uh
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
for the record Steve Appleby director of
 
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
educator support and higher education at
 
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed
 
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
um so in the nursing world you know
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
there are uh there's a subject matter
 
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
and the Name Escapes me a creditor that
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
credits nursing programs Nationwide
 
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
right that our colleges participate in
 
01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:26.750 align:start position:0%
right that our colleges participate in
so

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
um and additionally the Board of Nursing
 
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
is very very involved with these
 
01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
programs right they have to maintain
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
past rates uh for their graduates
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
in not all instances does the higher ed
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
commission have to approve an individual
 
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
degree program for example our public
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
colleges the higher education commission
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
has no jurisdiction over the public
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
colleges so we look to the accreditor
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
very typically to maintain the quality
 
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.209 align:start position:0%
very typically to maintain the quality
piece

01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:53.219 align:start position:0%
piece
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
so is that a net you like organism so we
 
01:17:58.970 --> 01:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
have institutional creditors such as
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
nachi the Western commission uh the
 
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
states other there are I believe it's
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
five Regional accreditors around the
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
country that accredited institutions but
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
then we also have subject matter of
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
creditors that so for example
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
um UNH the Public School of Business has
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
an accreditation from the business
 
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
accreditor right that's very high level
 
01:18:22.370 --> 01:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
in Ed prep Cape exists which accredits
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
teacher prep programs educated
 
01:18:26.209 --> 01:18:26.219 align:start position:0%
preparation programs so there are
 
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
there's institutional level
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
accreditation and then there's subject
 
01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:30.659 align:start position:0%
matter accreditation
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right I think we're going to
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
get down in the weeds too far here but
 
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
um we need to look at that yeah can I
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
just share some numbers I heard the
 
01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
question come up several times go ahead
 
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
um just some some quick information uh
 
01:18:43.729 --> 01:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
for the committee uh there are currently
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
approximately 488 licensed School nurses
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Education
 
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
and it's important to note that every
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
one of these individuals also holds a
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
board of nursing license so they hold
 
01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
two licenses within that 488 we have 32
 
01:19:00.179 --> 01:19:01.310 align:start position:0%
two licenses within that 488 we have 32
currently

01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
and here as we can tell that hold only
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
an associate's degree
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
so the question came up before I think
 
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
from representative Ellison about how
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
many we talking about it's 32
 
01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
individuals currently
 
01:19:15.169 --> 01:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
at most it could be less definitely
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
tracks with the Manchester District's
 
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
position title the school nurse one
 
01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
license we have 32 individuals who hold
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
it and those are individuals who
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
attain that license because they only
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
had an associates they may have since
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
gotten a bachelor's but not renewed
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
and the effect of this legislation will
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
allow those 32 if they haven't completed
 
01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
to renew
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
currently today when they expire
 
01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
and they only have an Associates there
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
is no path to renewal so this
 
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
legislation would give them another six
 
01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:49.790 align:start position:0%
legislation would give them another six
years

01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of the number of seats are
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
available either at Plymouth State UNH
 
01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
Saint anselms or other that are
 
01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
available and how many of those seats
 
01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
are occupied by out of state students I
 
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
do not
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
I do not have the information we could
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hall thank you Mr
 
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
question do you see the effective date
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
of being problematic like right now
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
school districts are hiring so if we've
 
01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
got to wait once it's passed then you
 
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:23.219 align:start position:0%
gotta wait another 60 days is that
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
almost too late for the 23-24
 
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
I I think from a hiring perspective it's
 
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
probably less problematic than for the
 
01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
32 individuals who are going to expire
 
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
potentially some number of them expire
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
this June 30th and they will not be able
 
01:20:45.169 --> 01:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
to renew that might be the more
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
immediate issue
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so we approve this
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
effective signage
 
01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:53.330 align:start position:0%
effective signage
yeah

01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:20:56.209 --> 01:20:56.219 align:start position:0%
good question represent cordial
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I have a very
 
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
quick question you Quantified the
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
number of uh licensed nurses and how
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
many have Associates but we keep hearing
 
01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
about this shortage is there any way you
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
can quantify that
 
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
of how many positions need being filled
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
that could be filled by these associate
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
level nurses yeah we we do not have that
 
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.970 align:start position:0%
level nurses yeah we we do not have that
information

01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
not seeing any other questions thank you
 
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
01:21:25.729 --> 01:21:25.739 align:start position:0%

this build is being introduced on behalf
 
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Department of

01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
the IT addresses two areas of law
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
State assessments
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
this bill clarifies the Statewide
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
student Assessment program including the
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
state's obligation to administer an
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
assessment in grades 3 through 8 and 11.
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
State accountability for an adequate
 
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
education this bill clarifies the
 
01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
criteria for an adequate education this
 
01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
bill removes language duplicative or
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
contradictory to the federal every
 
01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
student succeeds Act
 
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
this bill combines two areas of
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
legislation which is confusing in its
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
current format when read individually
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
this bill moves laws to a new section
 
01:33:30.050 --> 01:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
that are currently housed in adequate
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
education but they should be in their
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
own section of law
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
that is this sentence of this bill and
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
there will be people from the doe who
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I would just in terms of your
 
01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:48.709 align:start position:0%
thank you I would just in terms of your
comments

01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
um are you indicating that some of our
 
01:33:53.169 --> 01:33:53.179 align:start position:0%
statutes might be confusing
 
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
you said that not I
 
01:33:58.850 --> 01:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
a good response thank you uh
 
01:34:00.649 --> 01:34:00.659 align:start position:0%
representative Miler
 
01:34:02.930 --> 01:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
um thank you for being here Senator Ward
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
the question I would have how much time
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
did the Senate education committee spend
 
01:34:10.490 --> 01:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
on this particular reviewing this
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
particular bill is 26 pages so it's a
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
major it's a major piece here so how
 
01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
long what kind of time did you guys have
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
in your committee to look at this I
 
01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
don't think I ever put my clock on and
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
message how long time it takes to read I
 
01:34:28.490 --> 01:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
tried to read everything and then I go
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
through it and then we discuss it and I
 
01:34:33.169 --> 01:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
think the Department of Education has
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
been tremendously helpful and it's uh
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
explaining why things need to be done
 
01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
for the questions from the committee
 
01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.649 --> 01:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other pink cards up here
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
but um perhaps we could call up
 
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
our friends from the Department for uh
 
01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:12.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record Caitlin
 
01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
Davis from the Department of Education
 
01:35:18.649 --> 01:35:18.659 align:start position:0%
uh Nick Green New Hampshire Department
 
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
out and give the committee a little
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
history of why this bill exists
 
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I think you use or technical
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
assistance and that's exactly what this
 
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
bill is is its technical assistance to
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
um in what we think we need to implement
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
these programs
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
um so about uh two years ago so in the
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
last state budget the department had
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
requested a position to implement the
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
state accountability system required in
 
01:35:48.370 --> 01:35:48.380 align:start position:0%
RSA 193e
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
193e and 193 H
 
01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
those uh those programs the ibass and
 
01:35:58.810 --> 01:35:58.820 align:start position:0%
the pbas and the state accountability
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
have not had a specific position that's
 
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
overseen that work in a period of time
 
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
at the department so we had requested
 
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
that in our state budget and we're
 
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
granted that position
 
01:36:10.250 --> 01:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
the department then recruited and hired
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
for that position over the course of the
 
01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
last year and once we had that position
 
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
filled began to began the process of
 
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out exactly what these
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
statutes require the department to do
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
and how the department was about to or
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
how the department and what the
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
department needed to implement these
 
01:36:26.159 --> 01:36:27.430 align:start position:0%
department needed to implement these
statutes

01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
simultaneously the department
 
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
um just through a transition
 
01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
in Personnel at the department State
 
01:36:37.729 --> 01:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
assessments became became part of my
 
01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
division and we did the same thing for
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
RSA 193c which is the seed assessment
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
law so we have the assessment of State
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
accountability State assessment and
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
accountability now at the department and
 
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
we are now working to kind of organize
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
that and understand all of the state and
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
federal requirements that that division
 
01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:57.659 align:start position:0%
or that Bureau has
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so through that work
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
we literally just mapped out basically
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
what we thought the law had said
 
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
um and you know tried to put together a
 
01:37:09.410 --> 01:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
process of what we thought we needed to
 
01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:10.370 align:start position:0%
process of what we thought we needed to
do

01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
now historically the state law was
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
changed in 2017 to replace the state
 
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
ibas or sorry State pbas the
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:24.290 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
um

01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
to align with the state every student
 
01:37:29.689 --> 01:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
succeeds act plan so that was done maybe
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
I think 2017-18 it was right around the
 
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
same time that the state was actually
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
beginning to implement Essa for the
 
01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:37.860 align:start position:0%
first time we hadn't actually run the
 
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
calculations or done any of the work and
 
01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
whatnot relative to Essa so some of the
 
01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
language that ended up in the state law
 
01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
has either been changed or maybe too
 
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
repetitive of the federal law and
 
01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:52.010 align:start position:0%
repetitive of the federal law and
whatnot

01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
whatnot
 
01:37:54.649 --> 01:37:54.659 align:start position:0%
um and then in 2000 I believe it was 19
 
01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
or 20
 
01:37:59.330 --> 01:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
um the legislature changed the state law
 
01:38:02.689 --> 01:38:02.699 align:start position:0%
for requiring a school district to prove
 
01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
that they're providing an adequate
 
01:38:07.129 --> 01:38:07.139 align:start position:0%
education through both ibass and pbas
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
the input based accountability system
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
ibass and pbas a performance-based
 
01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:15.179 align:start position:0%
accountability system so previously a
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
school district could prove that they
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
were providing an adequate education
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
through either so either the ibass or
 
01:38:24.290 --> 01:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
the pbas and so that change was made
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
this change was made before the
 
01:38:28.129 --> 01:38:28.139 align:start position:0%
department began this process of trying
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
to understand the current laws and
 
01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
whatnot and actually it was funny
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
because we actually had somebody that
 
01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
was kind of referring to one section of
 
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
the law and RSA 193h and they're saying
 
01:38:40.850 --> 01:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
oh yeah well pbas requires this and the
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
school's only required to do a p-bas and
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
then he said well you have to actually
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
read RSA 193 E2 which then actually
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
refers back to both ibass and PBS so
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's already a few areas where the
 
01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
law is very confusing
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
so through this process and US mapping
 
01:38:58.490 --> 01:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
out the laws and and whatnot and kind of
 
01:39:00.530 --> 01:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
what we need to do we said well why
 
01:39:02.930 --> 01:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
don't we do a comprehensive rewrite of
 
01:39:05.209 --> 01:39:05.219 align:start position:0%
these three sections of law to make sure
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
that they make sense and that they are
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
clear and give the department a path
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
forward to the work that we are required
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
to do so most of the changes you have in
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
front of you we are not trying to change
 
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
the current process the current system
 
01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
and the current requirements on school
 
01:39:25.850 --> 01:39:25.860 align:start position:0%
districts but what we're trying to do is
 
01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
give us essentially the ability to
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
implement the law in a clear path
 
01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:31.030 align:start position:0%
implement the law in a clear path
forward

01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
and then knowing that
 
01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
there are some changes that our actual
 
01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
policy changes that members of the
 
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
committee might want to make in school
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
districts School Board School members
 
01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
might want to make as well there's a
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
time for that presidentially in the
 
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
future after this bill but this bill is
 
01:39:52.129 --> 01:39:52.139 align:start position:0%
really just to give us the authority to
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
do what we believe exists in current law
 
01:39:55.679 --> 01:39:56.930 align:start position:0%
do what we believe exists in current law
so

01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
um given that I do believe does the
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee have the document from Gen 4
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
um we were sent that last night as well
 
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
I mean Nate and I went through it
 
01:40:10.850 --> 01:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
um on a line by line basis there was an
 
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
actually great information in that
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
document now I can't imagine having to
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
put it together again but
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
um I think it's extremely helpful
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
um and so if this time if the committee
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
has time today we could talk through
 
01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
that on the line by line basis and go
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
through it or we could do that in the
 
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
work session or I just don't I don't
 
01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
know how you want to do I it's a 42-page
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
document so I would imagine it will take
 
01:40:41.689 --> 01:40:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
um my personal feeling is that you
 
01:40:46.490 --> 01:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
probably need a work session to uh to
 
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
work through this I think we're already
 
01:40:51.169 --> 01:40:51.179 align:start position:0%
behind a little bit today and we would
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
be way behind uh if you went through it
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
all today representative Miler I think
 
01:40:58.729 --> 01:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
in talking with the chairman Ladd
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
we have uh rescheduled the HB 272 to the
 
01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
18th so there's a gap tomorrow
 
01:41:13.129 --> 01:41:13.139 align:start position:0%
between our 11 31 and the 131 and I
 
01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
think it's his intent tomorrow to have
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
at least an initial work session on this
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
particular Bill dealing dealing with the
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
work that Jen has done so that's that's
 
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
our plan initially and we may need to
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
have more time but this at least will
 
01:41:30.590 --> 01:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
give us the first blush of looking at
 
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
this uh tomorrow okay
 
01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
um I know I'm not available tomorrow at
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
that time and Nate I'm just going to
 
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:42.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
questions at the moment
 
01:41:45.239 --> 01:41:46.609 align:start position:0%
questions at the moment
um

01:41:46.609 --> 01:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:48.609 --> 01:41:48.619 align:start position:0%
yeah I will say you know
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
being on this committee for 11 years
 
01:41:53.810 --> 01:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
every time somebody says well we just
 
01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
had to rewrite it's uh it's just uh this
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh raises red flag for me initially on
 
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
initial blush on this to make sure it
 
01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
make damn sure that it's not just a
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
rewrite but that and so that's that's
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
the perceptual screen that I've got When
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
anybody says that to me so this this
 
01:42:15.770 --> 01:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
will obviously have to have a lot of
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
work before we actually act on it I
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
think that's fair and I think that even
 
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
going through the document that Jen
 
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
prepared um do we noticed for example
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
there was a definition that was missing
 
01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
and so well we didn't intend on getting
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
rid of this definition
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
in our we went back and looked at our
 
01:42:32.689 --> 01:42:32.699 align:start position:0%
notes because we have folders and
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
folders of notes that we were preparing
 
01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
going through this and we had not
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
deleted that definition but it did go
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
away so that would be an area for us to
 
01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:44.540 align:start position:0%
to fix that um but yes
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
let's try thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
 
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
um the thing that actually made thank
 
01:42:53.689 --> 01:42:53.699 align:start position:0%
you very much for the side-by-side
 
01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
version amazing to do
 
01:42:58.609 --> 01:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
um uh the thing that jumped out to me
 
01:43:00.649 --> 01:43:00.659 align:start position:0%
and it's just because I focus on this
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
aspect is the part about rule making and
 
01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
it changes from a shall to a May and
 
01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
that's a big deal to me
 
01:43:10.729 --> 01:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
um the the notes say the section's
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
identical in both versions but it's not
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
because it's a shell and the concurrent
 
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
section is relative to the assessment
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
and having rules around the assessment
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
the department does not currently have
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
assessment rules and so we don't
 
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily feel like they're necessary
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
we may want to do assessment we may want
 
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
to do rules on that going forward but as
 
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
of right now we have not had rules and
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
we we're implementing the program
 
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
without rules okay even though it's set
 
01:43:44.410 --> 01:43:44.420 align:start position:0%
excuse me follow-up even though it said
 
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
in the current rules it says shall
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
adoptables they haven't been adopted we
 
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
don't have assessment rules okay thank
 
01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:52.850 align:start position:0%
don't have assessment rules okay thank
you

01:43:52.850 --> 01:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell thank you Nate is
 
01:43:56.810 --> 01:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
this the side by side we talked about on
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
Monday at the oversight committee so if
 
01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
there's a I think there were a couple
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
things we talked about
 
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
um at the oversight committee on Monday
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
so there's another side by side for the
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
minimum standards work okay um that I I
 
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
have this morning now and I'll send that
 
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
out to the committee as well I was
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
getting so there are multiple side by
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
sides yeah that's the thing this doesn't
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
look like what we were talking about no
 
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
this is this is different from okay
 
01:44:18.649 --> 01:44:18.659 align:start position:0%
great so I'm glad there's another side
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
by side thank you you're welcome
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're requesting more side by sides
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.689 --> 01:44:31.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:36.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
um representative cascadden thank you um
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
just a comment I think that when we're
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
um next week when we have that break it
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem long enough for me and I
 
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
fear that we're going to get it oh
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow okay because
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
um I fear that we're gonna get knee deep
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
into it and we're gonna have to cut it
 
01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
short and I I'd like to suggest that we
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
have an exact session to begin the day
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
with that so that we're not
 
01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:06.350 align:start position:0%
with that so that we're not
scrambling

01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
scrambling
 
01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
just a suggestion thanks
 
01:45:10.729 --> 01:45:10.739 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would guess there will be
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
multiple work sessions on this
 
01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.770 align:start position:0%
multiple work sessions on this
yeah

01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and I know chairman was going to be
 
01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
working on a schedule for uh next week
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
um so you know we'll see about that
 
01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead please thank you representative
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh just one question for you you're not
 
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
going to be changing the input based or
 
01:45:38.209 --> 01:45:38.219 align:start position:0%
the performance base that's going to be
 
01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
maintained that is correct we uh and
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
right now we would like to leave it
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
exactly the same we're just clarifying
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
that so the input based accountability
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
system is there it is specific to the
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
criteria for an adequate education I'm
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
sure that you remember that the input
 
01:45:56.930 --> 01:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
based accountability system before was
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
very long we have actually internally
 
01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
gone through and taken the things that
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
are not relevant to the criteria for an
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
adequate education out of the
 
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
performance space because there was
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
other information that was in that but
 
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
we do intend to really true up the
 
01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:12.020 align:start position:0%
perform the performance space or sorry
 
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
the ibass to the intent of the law the
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
is aligned with Essa and current law and
 
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
so the weird thing was not the weird
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
thing uh the thing that we did at the
 
01:46:28.250 --> 01:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
department at the time was we did
 
01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
regurgitate some of the federal law into
 
01:46:33.229 --> 01:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
the state statute and we felt we could
 
01:46:36.169 --> 01:46:36.179 align:start position:0%
take that out of the state law and refer
 
01:46:38.209 --> 01:46:38.219 align:start position:0%
just back to the federal statute that
 
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
way if there were changes in one area or
 
01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
the other and now they didn't match each
 
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
other so that's all we did but we still
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
intend the performance-based
 
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
accountability system to align with the
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
federal Essa plan which is that's in
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
current law and then the input-based
 
01:46:56.689 --> 01:46:56.699 align:start position:0%
accountability system to be a survey
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
with narratives that aligns to the
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
criteria for an adequate education as
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 193e
 
01:47:06.169 --> 01:47:06.179 align:start position:0%
and remind me to follow up
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
remind me again school districts have to
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
do both or one or the other so it was in
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
2019 or 2020 somebody from the committee
 
01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
actually representative lad might
 
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
remember because I think it was his bill
 
01:47:20.209 --> 01:47:20.219 align:start position:0%
um it changed to both previously it had
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
been or but it was changed three or four
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
um maybe for the new committee members
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
could you just touch on Essa what
 
01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
asset is oh sure um the every student
 
01:47:36.590 --> 01:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
succeeds act as a federal act that
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
um has a variety of state or sorry a
 
01:47:41.689 --> 01:47:41.699 align:start position:0%
variety of accountability requirements
 
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
that states are required to comply with
 
01:47:47.649 --> 01:47:47.659 align:start position:0%
um so it has information around status
 
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
assessments and then performance in
 
01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
certain subgroups so the state has a
 
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
state plan that has been approved by the
 
01:47:59.570 --> 01:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
U.S Department of Education and we are
 
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
using that information to determine
 
01:48:05.570 --> 01:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
schools as either CSI comprehensive
 
01:48:09.169 --> 01:48:09.179 align:start position:0%
support assistant schools Improvement
 
01:48:11.450 --> 01:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
schools and can you he's better with the
 
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
definitions sure yeah so so the state
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%
Esso plan is a way for us to identify
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
High performing and low performing
 
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
schools using a variety of indicators so
 
01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
we have three different designations for
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
schools CSI TSI and ATS csir
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive support and Improvement
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
which means on a whole a school across
 
01:48:31.370 --> 01:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
the board for their students tend to be
 
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
in the lower performing of schools in
 
01:48:36.169 --> 01:48:36.179 align:start position:0%
the state TSI and atsi schools are based
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
more off of subgroups so you may have a
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
school that overall is doing well
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
academically but they may have one or
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
two subgroups of students that are
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
performing lower than their peers
 
01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:47.219 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we see this with subgroups
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
such as low-income students or students
 
01:48:51.649 --> 01:48:51.659 align:start position:0%
with IEPs or students with disabilities
 
01:48:53.450 --> 01:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
and so there are different ways of
 
01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
identifying schools but for the most
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
part we use the state assessment data to
 
01:48:59.209 --> 01:48:59.219 align:start position:0%
do those identifications and that's all
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative Damon thank you Mr
 
01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:08.169 align:start position:0%
yes representative Damon thank you Mr
chair

01:49:08.169 --> 01:49:08.179 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
more than one question here the first
 
01:49:14.209 --> 01:49:14.219 align:start position:0%
one is not meant humorously is there a
 
01:49:16.129 --> 01:49:16.139 align:start position:0%
list of acronyms that the Department of
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
Education uses somewhere there so yes
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
and no I would say probably the closest
 
01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
thing on our our website we have our I
 
01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:26.340 align:start position:0%
platform system so all of our data is
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
through that I report I define i define
 
01:49:31.729 --> 01:49:31.739 align:start position:0%
specifically as our data dictionary so
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
everything that we report on has a
 
01:49:36.890 --> 01:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
definition in that data dictionary so if
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
you're looking at something that you
 
01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
know some indicator or some piece of
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
data that's on our website it should
 
01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
also be within that data dictionary and
 
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
you should be able to see where the data
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
comes from and what it means that's not
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily a list of acronyms but it's
 
01:49:51.649 --> 01:49:51.659 align:start position:0%
probably the closest thing that we have
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll have a bill about acronyms
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
next year I mean actually as a back to
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
this whole purpose we found a lot of
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
areas where there were terms that were
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
used that were not defined or there were
 
01:50:05.930 --> 01:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
definitions that were used like the
 
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
actually terms that were defined but
 
01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:09.179 align:start position:0%
then the terms were not used anywhere in
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
that section of law so we did try to
 
01:50:13.370 --> 01:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
clean some of that up in this
 
01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:14.050 align:start position:0%
clean some of that up in this
um

01:50:14.050 --> 01:50:14.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
simultaneously the department did put in
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
a bill to have a recodification of the
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
education laws and I believe that's
 
01:50:22.850 --> 01:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
floating around someplace in finance as
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
far as the state budget is concerned but
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's that might be a an opportunity for
 
01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:29.570 align:start position:0%
it's that might be a an opportunity for
that

01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:31.910 align:start position:0%
that
follow

01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
um so when did
 
01:50:36.970 --> 01:50:36.980 align:start position:0%
the federal government Implement Essa
 
01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
2017 was when our student plan was
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.689 --> 01:50:47.699 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
so then once these schools are
 
01:50:51.890 --> 01:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
identified and have their little acronym
 
01:50:55.490 --> 01:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
attached to them what happens so there
 
01:50:58.970 --> 01:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
is a in law right now there's a step of
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's actually do you have a bill in
 
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
um well let's talk about this yeah so
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of you on page
 
01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:16.490 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of you on page
see

01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.129 --> 01:51:19.139 align:start position:0%
on page 11 that's where the technical
 
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
the correction and technical assistance
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
work goes into place
 
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
so that's once a school's been
 
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
identified and that's mirrors the
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
current existing state law there we
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
didn't propose any changes to this
 
01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:33.109 align:start position:0%
didn't propose any changes to this
section

01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.810 --> 01:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
see none
 
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much and um I'm sure
 
01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
we'll be uh seeing quite a bit of you in
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:54.890 --> 01:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
um and um uh Mr Green you can possibly
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
have time tomorrow if if we do have
 
01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh was there anybody else who wanted to
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
uh testify on this
 
01:52:09.719 --> 01:52:11.270 align:start position:0%
uh testify on this
bill

01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
see none we'll close the hearing on
 
01:52:19.609 --> 01:52:19.619 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 266 and move right into uh
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:26.649 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:52:26.649 --> 01:52:26.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%

I'm Bruce Ford and I represent Senate
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:55.609 --> 01:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill 25
 
01:52:58.250 --> 01:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
is a repeals the Department of Education
 
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement on payments made
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year to a chartered Public
 
01:53:04.199 --> 01:53:05.629 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year to a chartered Public
School

01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
and it's no longer needed and that's why
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
and again any questions Department of

thank you Senator uh questions for the
 
01:53:24.659 --> 01:53:26.570 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator uh questions for the
senator

01:53:26.570 --> 01:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:53:29.209 --> 01:53:29.219 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh representative Damon
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:53:33.649 --> 01:53:33.659 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Senator Ward was
 
01:53:36.169 --> 01:53:36.179 align:start position:0%
this bill requested by Doe why didn't
 
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
was this bill requested by the
 
01:53:43.609 --> 01:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:53:47.629 --> 01:53:47.639 align:start position:0%
the other day didn't didn't you pass a
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
similar bill in the Senate uh our house
 
01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
bill coming up who passed the bill of
 
01:53:56.209 --> 01:53:56.219 align:start position:0%
the Senate yes and but we we passed a
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
bill like this uh in the house and I
 
01:54:00.169 --> 01:54:00.179 align:start position:0%
believe it was
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
it went through the Senate the other day
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
when I was there
 
01:54:05.209 --> 01:54:05.219 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of times I have found
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
that identical bills have shown up both
 
01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
in the house and the Senate
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
in one place I found one word was
 
01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:14.940 align:start position:0%
changed that was that was the only
 
01:54:17.209 --> 01:54:17.219 align:start position:0%
difference between them so it's double
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very much Senator
 
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
um did we have any other we didn't have
 
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.129 --> 01:54:37.139 align:start position:0%
did the committee members think that
 
01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
there was any technical assistance
 
01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
required from the Department on this
 
01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:42.010 align:start position:0%
required from the Department on this
bill

01:54:42.010 --> 01:54:42.020 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:54:45.890 --> 01:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
this is the same exact Bill uh yes okay
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
thank you well then in in that case
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
we'll uh get ahead of schedule and uh
 
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on uh Senate bill 25.
 
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:02.750 align:start position:0%
um and
um

01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
we'll take no action on that right now
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
um and so I guess we have our next bill
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
at one o'clock and we can uh recess
 
01:55:13.729 --> 01:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
until that time
 
03:12:03.710 --> 03:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:08.510 --> 03:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
we have SB 136 scheduled to start eight
 
03:12:10.910 --> 03:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
minutes ago or six minutes ago that's
 
03:12:12.769 --> 03:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the employment or
 
03:12:15.650 --> 03:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
volunteering of a revoked or suspended
 
03:12:15.660 --> 03:12:17.269 align:start position:0%
volunteering of a revoked or suspended
educator

03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
educator
 
03:12:21.309 --> 03:12:21.319 align:start position:0%
and looks like we have Ruth here
 
03:12:24.590 --> 03:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
hello Grant
 
03:12:26.630 --> 03:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
Bruce Bruce Ward is the senator
 
03:12:29.330 --> 03:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
sponsoring this bill and
 
03:12:32.510 --> 03:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
she sent the other side yes thank you uh
 
03:12:35.150 --> 03:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee uh
 
03:12:37.309 --> 03:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
I am not Ruth Ward I am graph Aussie
 
03:12:38.570 --> 03:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
Deputy Chief of Staff in the New
 
03:12:40.370 --> 03:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senate here on behalf
 
03:12:42.769 --> 03:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
of Senator Ward the prime sponsor of
 
03:12:46.370 --> 03:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 136. sb-136 would update the
 
03:12:48.349 --> 03:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
statute governing the revoked and
 
03:12:51.490 --> 03:12:51.500 align:start position:0%
suspended educator list RSA
 
03:12:54.889 --> 03:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
18913a suspended Educators could be
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
hired in anticipation of when that
 
03:13:00.889 --> 03:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
suspension was going to be lifted or if
 
03:13:02.809 --> 03:13:02.819 align:start position:0%
an educator maintains a valid credential
 
03:13:05.769 --> 03:13:05.779 align:start position:0%
in another endorsement area
 
03:13:07.969 --> 03:13:07.979 align:start position:0%
aside from where their endorsement was
 
03:13:09.889 --> 03:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
revoked or suspended it would also
 
03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that Educators with revoked
 
03:13:14.030 --> 03:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
credentials would not be hired as
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
Volunteers in the school notably this
 
03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
bill would not prevent former Educators
 
03:13:21.050 --> 03:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
from activities that are open to the
 
03:13:23.269 --> 03:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
public in general such as attending a
 
03:13:24.530 --> 03:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
basketball game or a high school
 
03:13:27.050 --> 03:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
graduation it would not limit their
 
03:13:29.630 --> 03:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
rights as a parent uh the Department of
 
03:13:31.250 --> 03:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
Education is here to answer any
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
questions you may have about the
 
03:13:34.550 --> 03:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
credential revocation process and the
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
changes that SB 136 would make Senator
 
03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
thanks for your consideration and ask
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
for your support for Senate Bill 136.
 
03:13:43.250 --> 03:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you great
 
03:13:45.230 --> 03:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
um I take it you probably are not
 
03:13:46.910 --> 03:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
interested in uh questions at this point
 
03:13:48.050 --> 03:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
I always
 
03:13:50.090 --> 03:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
questions I can't promise answers okay I
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
would defer to the department if you
 
03:13:53.210 --> 03:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
have anything for Senator Ward
 
03:13:54.889 --> 03:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
specifically I can take notes and get an
 
03:13:57.469 --> 03:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
answer back to you thank you any
 
03:14:00.769 --> 03:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr bossy
 
03:14:03.650 --> 03:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
see you none thank you very much and I
 
03:14:07.130 --> 03:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
will mention that Diana Fenton is here
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
from the Department for any technical
 
03:14:12.590 --> 03:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
assistance but next I'll call on Megan
 
03:14:12.600 --> 03:14:26.889 align:start position:0%
assistance but next I'll call on Megan
Tuttle

03:14:26.889 --> 03:14:26.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:29.030 --> 03:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record my name is
 
03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
Megan Tuttle I'm president of Nea New
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representing 17 000 Educators
 
03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
across the state and I did come up with
 
03:14:38.929 --> 03:14:38.939 align:start position:0%
Diane FN from the doe because we did
 
03:14:41.230 --> 03:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
work on this together so
 
03:14:44.210 --> 03:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
we're in full support of this
 
03:14:44.220 --> 03:14:44.870 align:start position:0%
we're in full support of this
um

03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:47.410 --> 03:14:47.420 align:start position:0%
dogs and that's it living in harmony
 
03:14:49.610 --> 03:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
I think the committee will appreciate
 
03:14:51.290 --> 03:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh Megan and I are here
 
03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
testifying jointly for the record Diana
 
03:14:55.070 --> 03:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
Fenton with the Department of Education
 
03:14:58.370 --> 03:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh I want to thank Megan
 
03:15:00.650 --> 03:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
um and the Nea right before
 
03:15:02.269 --> 03:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
um President's Day weekend the three-day
 
03:15:04.490 --> 03:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
weekend I called her on a Friday morning
 
03:15:07.010 --> 03:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
which is really mean and I said hey
 
03:15:09.050 --> 03:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 136. where are you guys at
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
with it and she said let me take a look
 
03:15:13.429 --> 03:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
at it and I will get you my thoughts by
 
03:15:15.590 --> 03:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and she did she sent me
 
03:15:18.230 --> 03:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
an amendment um that the department was
 
03:15:21.230 --> 03:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
amenable to that we can live with
 
03:15:23.630 --> 03:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
um but we have worked really closely on
 
03:15:25.490 --> 03:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
this bill together
 
03:15:27.110 --> 03:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to note that
 
03:15:28.910 --> 03:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
the revoked and suspended educator list
 
03:15:32.389 --> 03:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
we have an entire process set up to
 
03:15:35.030 --> 03:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that Educators get the due
 
03:15:36.650 --> 03:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
process that they are entitled to and
 
03:15:39.050 --> 03:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
deserve but there are some offenses on
 
03:15:41.630 --> 03:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
that list that are not Criminal
 
03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
so the idea that an HR department can do
 
03:15:46.730 --> 03:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
a Google Search and and find out the
 
03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
history is not entirely accurate and the
 
03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
anecdotal story I share is we had a
 
03:15:52.610 --> 03:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
gentleman who
 
03:15:55.670 --> 03:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
um wrote A A Love Song to a 13 year old
 
03:15:58.010 --> 03:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
child and sent it to her
 
03:16:01.610 --> 03:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
um and that's not illegal conduct it
 
03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
should be but that's for another
 
03:16:04.490 --> 03:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
committee to decide down the hall in
 
03:16:06.170 --> 03:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
criminal justice
 
03:16:08.630 --> 03:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and this superintendent did did
 
03:16:10.969 --> 03:16:10.979 align:start position:0%
everything she was supposed to do and
 
03:16:13.370 --> 03:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
worked with the department and we took
 
03:16:15.170 --> 03:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
action on that gentleman's license so
 
03:16:18.590 --> 03:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
that he would not go to another District
 
03:16:20.210 --> 03:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not here to speak for that
 
03:16:22.010 --> 03:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
superintendent but I can tell you that
 
03:16:24.769 --> 03:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
and I will paraphrase she said I've
 
03:16:27.230 --> 03:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
never seen anything like this before she
 
03:16:29.929 --> 03:16:29.939 align:start position:0%
said he wrote a complete love song with
 
03:16:32.990 --> 03:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
lyrics and a musical clip where he sang
 
03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:34.250 align:start position:0%
lyrics and a musical clip where he sang
it

03:16:34.250 --> 03:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:16:37.790 --> 03:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
um and yes that is exactly the right
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
reaction and those are the types of
 
03:16:43.250 --> 03:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
behaviors that working together with Nea
 
03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
we are stopping and we are stopping from
 
03:16:47.929 --> 03:16:47.939 align:start position:0%
going from one District to another
 
03:16:49.910 --> 03:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
district and the department can't do it
 
03:16:49.920 --> 03:16:50.690 align:start position:0%
district and the department can't do it
alone

03:16:50.690 --> 03:16:50.700 align:start position:0%
alone
 
03:16:52.910 --> 03:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
we do it with with our partners at the
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
union and yes that's right I said
 
03:16:56.889 --> 03:16:56.899 align:start position:0%
Partners at the union
 
03:16:59.570 --> 03:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
and this is on video so everyone does
 
03:17:01.370 --> 03:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
see it up here together
 
03:17:03.170 --> 03:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
um but you know one of our concerns with
 
03:17:04.670 --> 03:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
this when I originally came out was
 
03:17:07.250 --> 03:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
stopping as um it was introduced a
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
parent who might be an educator from
 
03:17:11.389 --> 03:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
going to something this is not to say
 
03:17:12.889 --> 03:17:12.899 align:start position:0%
that they should be going on like the DC
 
03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
trip or anything like that if they're on
 
03:17:15.889 --> 03:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
one of these lists because obviously
 
03:17:18.050 --> 03:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't this is more you know we
 
03:17:19.730 --> 03:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that you know as a
 
03:17:21.170 --> 03:17:21.180 align:start position:0%
parent if you're an educator but your
 
03:17:22.670 --> 03:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
license is revoked or suspended you can
 
03:17:24.769 --> 03:17:24.779 align:start position:0%
still go to graduation or to like they
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
said the basketball game Etc so the
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
language in here allows that in the
 
03:17:29.690 --> 03:17:29.700 align:start position:0%
amendment and so we are in full support
 
03:17:31.610 --> 03:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
of it
 
03:17:33.050 --> 03:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:35.269 --> 03:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
um representative miler
 
03:17:37.910 --> 03:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so could you
 
03:17:41.330 --> 03:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
succinctly give us the intent
 
03:17:43.550 --> 03:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
which one of us whoever I mean for us
 
03:17:49.250 --> 03:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
it's bad if you are on the vote or
 
03:17:52.490 --> 03:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
suspended less that you are on there for
 
03:17:54.349 --> 03:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
a reason and you're not you know if
 
03:17:55.490 --> 03:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
you're on the revoked list you're not
 
03:17:56.690 --> 03:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
going to be hired somewhere else because
 
03:17:57.889 --> 03:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
if you're on the revoked list that's
 
03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
usually pretty serious offense
 
03:18:02.090 --> 03:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
and most likely you should not be around
 
03:18:04.010 --> 03:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
children in the teaching capacity or
 
03:18:05.690 --> 03:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
educator capacity
 
03:18:07.969 --> 03:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
um the suspended list
 
03:18:09.769 --> 03:18:09.779 align:start position:0%
until you're off suspension because it's
 
03:18:12.050 --> 03:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
a lesser offense you know you should
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
still be allowed later when you're off
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
the list to get a job
 
03:18:18.349 --> 03:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
um and I will just add to it the intent
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
of this is to ensure that
 
03:18:23.090 --> 03:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
um all districts
 
03:18:25.670 --> 03:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
understand the severity of that list
 
03:18:28.790 --> 03:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
and take the time to review that list in
 
03:18:32.590 --> 03:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
making their hiring decisions thank you
 
03:18:34.670 --> 03:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell
 
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:18:36.960 --> 03:18:37.849 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
question

03:18:37.849 --> 03:18:37.859 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:18:40.550 --> 03:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
um it says non-public schools
 
03:18:43.250 --> 03:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
um could you explain what you mean by
 
03:18:46.309 --> 03:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
non-public schools and and do we have
 
03:18:51.349 --> 03:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
any control over non-public schools so
 
03:18:51.359 --> 03:18:52.510 align:start position:0%
any control over non-public schools so
um

03:18:52.510 --> 03:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:55.370 --> 03:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
we wanted this to be applicable to the
 
03:18:57.530 --> 03:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
private schools as well and if you look
 
03:19:00.290 --> 03:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
at 189 13A in its entirety it does say
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
that a non-public school does not have
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
to follow the procedure set forth in the
 
03:19:05.399 --> 03:19:06.290 align:start position:0%
to follow the procedure set forth in the
statute

03:19:06.290 --> 03:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:19:08.330 --> 03:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
as it applies to criminal history checks
 
03:19:10.670 --> 03:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
but if they do so they have to follow
 
03:19:13.190 --> 03:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
the entire statutory provision they
 
03:19:15.590 --> 03:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
can't pick and choose which Provisions
 
03:19:17.929 --> 03:19:17.939 align:start position:0%
they take on so this would be saying
 
03:19:20.570 --> 03:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
that if we have an educator who's
 
03:19:23.030 --> 03:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
writing love songs so 13 year old childs
 
03:19:24.650 --> 03:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
children and we don't want them in the
 
03:19:26.809 --> 03:19:26.819 align:start position:0%
public school we don't want them in the
 
03:19:29.150 --> 03:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
private school either
 
03:19:32.570 --> 03:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
and we felt that that was appropriate
 
03:19:35.450 --> 03:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner just thank you and
 
03:19:37.010 --> 03:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
just as a follow-up because I had that
 
03:19:38.809 --> 03:19:38.819 align:start position:0%
circled as well
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
um what about approved schools for
 
03:19:40.800 --> 03:19:42.290 align:start position:0%
um what about approved schools for
tuition

03:19:42.290 --> 03:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
03:19:46.250 --> 03:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh that uh when I see that non-public
 
03:19:48.769 --> 03:19:48.779 align:start position:0%
school I understand about the private
 
03:19:50.330 --> 03:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
school part but what about all these
 
03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
approved schools for tuition purposes
 
03:19:57.110 --> 03:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
my understanding and I can double check
 
03:19:58.910 --> 03:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the approved schools
 
03:20:01.250 --> 03:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
for tuition would fall within the 189
 
03:20:04.550 --> 03:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
13A I think it is equally applicable but
 
03:20:05.990 --> 03:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
I will double check on that and get back
 
03:20:08.090 --> 03:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
to you thank you representative
 
03:20:08.100 --> 03:20:09.469 align:start position:0%
to you thank you representative
cascadden

03:20:09.469 --> 03:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
cascadden
 
03:20:11.690 --> 03:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh thank you
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and I it's a
 
03:20:15.769 --> 03:20:15.779 align:start position:0%
little twofold I'm looking at number one
 
03:20:19.610 --> 03:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
and two in line six seven and eight
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
so if an educator has been suspended for
 
03:20:24.830 --> 03:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
a violation
 
03:20:27.550 --> 03:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
and they are dual certified
 
03:20:30.950 --> 03:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
say English and special ed you can keep
 
03:20:33.230 --> 03:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
that person on staff if they teach
 
03:20:35.450 --> 03:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
special ed if they wrote a song in
 
03:20:35.460 --> 03:20:36.710 align:start position:0%
special ed if they wrote a song in
English

03:20:36.710 --> 03:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
English
 
03:20:38.510 --> 03:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
I mean to the Inc
 
03:20:40.610 --> 03:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
wait a minute so somebody's dual
 
03:20:42.410 --> 03:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
certified yeah
 
03:20:45.170 --> 03:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
and I'll use the example you gave of the
 
03:20:46.849 --> 03:20:46.859 align:start position:0%
teacher wrote A Love Song to a student
 
03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
or however you want to interpret that
 
03:20:53.389 --> 03:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
and he was serving in a cat he or she
 
03:20:54.830 --> 03:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
was serving in a capacity of an English
 
03:20:56.870 --> 03:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
teacher sure
 
03:20:59.330 --> 03:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
so if his English credentials are
 
03:21:02.210 --> 03:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
suspended for that violation can that
 
03:21:04.610 --> 03:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
District keep that teacher on if they
 
03:21:07.550 --> 03:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
reassign them to special education
 
03:21:09.769 --> 03:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
the short answer is no typically when
 
03:21:11.210 --> 03:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
the department takes the action what
 
03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
your what you are referring to are the
 
03:21:15.110 --> 03:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
endorsements right right and it's not
 
03:21:16.910 --> 03:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
unusual for an educator to have multiple
 
03:21:18.590 --> 03:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
endorsements right
 
03:21:21.290 --> 03:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
um special ed endorsement social studies
 
03:21:23.210 --> 03:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
endorsement principal endorsement
 
03:21:24.530 --> 03:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're serving in
 
03:21:26.389 --> 03:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
that capacity employment wise but they
 
03:21:28.269 --> 03:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
have these endorsements
 
03:21:31.309 --> 03:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
typically with very rare exception
 
03:21:34.610 --> 03:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
when the department takes action on an
 
03:21:37.309 --> 03:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
Educator's teaching credential and
 
03:21:39.290 --> 03:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
please know the department does not do
 
03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
that lightly those are very serious
 
03:21:44.750 --> 03:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
offenses it is a child safety issue and
 
03:21:46.490 --> 03:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
the department does not split the
 
03:21:48.769 --> 03:21:48.779 align:start position:0%
endorsements we would not say well you
 
03:21:50.929 --> 03:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
taught this class and you wrote a love
 
03:21:52.490 --> 03:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
song to a child in this class so we're
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
going to take that endorsement
 
03:21:55.309 --> 03:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
historically we have learned that that
 
03:21:56.510 --> 03:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
03:21:58.490 --> 03:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
that is just a slap on the wrist and
 
03:22:00.530 --> 03:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
it's ineffective and so if we take that
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
kind of action
 
03:22:03.769 --> 03:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
um again we don't take it lightly we
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
take it for all endorsement areas there
 
03:22:07.790 --> 03:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
have been some exceptions to that
 
03:22:10.490 --> 03:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
um but that is not the that is not the
 
03:22:10.500 --> 03:22:12.650 align:start position:0%
um but that is not the that is not the
norm

03:22:12.650 --> 03:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
norm
 
03:22:14.750 --> 03:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up please
 
03:22:18.710 --> 03:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
um so the second scenario is
 
03:22:21.290 --> 03:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
Educators who have their credentials
 
03:22:21.300 --> 03:22:22.550 align:start position:0%
Educators who have their credentials
suspended

03:22:22.550 --> 03:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
03:22:25.309 --> 03:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
there's a time limit on that I thought
 
03:22:26.870 --> 03:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
once they were revoked they were revoked
 
03:22:26.880 --> 03:22:27.769 align:start position:0%
once they were revoked they were revoked
forever

03:22:27.769 --> 03:22:27.779 align:start position:0%
forever
 
03:22:29.870 --> 03:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
so a revocation is a permanent
 
03:22:32.990 --> 03:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
rescission okay a revocation is uh
 
03:22:34.550 --> 03:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
reserved permanent
 
03:22:36.889 --> 03:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
for individuals Educators who are having
 
03:22:38.690 --> 03:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
a sexual relationship with a child right
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
we've had examples of that there are
 
03:22:40.920 --> 03:22:41.929 align:start position:0%
we've had examples of that there are
other

03:22:41.929 --> 03:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:22:41.939 --> 03:22:42.830 align:start position:0%
other
um

03:22:42.830 --> 03:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:45.590 --> 03:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
situations where a suspension is the
 
03:22:48.230 --> 03:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate course and we work with the
 
03:22:50.809 --> 03:22:50.819 align:start position:0%
Union to put in parameters they might be
 
03:22:53.269 --> 03:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
classes they might be ethics courses to
 
03:22:55.370 --> 03:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
get that person back into the classroom
 
03:22:57.290 --> 03:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
and those are for set periods of time
 
03:22:58.730 --> 03:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
that we agree ahead of time with the
 
03:23:01.309 --> 03:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
Union what that is so suspension would
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
have an end date yes and I'm sorry can I
 
03:23:08.269 --> 03:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
just finish it up please
 
03:23:11.809 --> 03:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
um so a teacher who has a suspended
 
03:23:14.809 --> 03:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
certification and then the certification
 
03:23:17.389 --> 03:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
lapse and they get their recertification
 
03:23:20.330 --> 03:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
again and go to another District now
 
03:23:21.769 --> 03:23:21.779 align:start position:0%
when they go to another District they
 
03:23:23.210 --> 03:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
have to have criminal background check
 
03:23:25.550 --> 03:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
will that history show up for that
 
03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
district and then is it up to that
 
03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
District to decide whether they hire
 
03:23:31.130 --> 03:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
them or not
 
03:23:34.429 --> 03:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
to follow me I'm just trying to see so
 
03:23:37.790 --> 03:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh well a suspension is different than a
 
03:23:42.650 --> 03:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:45.170 --> 03:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
um the actions that are taken on the
 
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
revoked and suspended educator list
 
03:23:49.849 --> 03:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
do not that list is separate and
 
03:23:51.530 --> 03:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
distinct from a criminal history okay
 
03:23:53.030 --> 03:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's where I was going with that
 
03:23:55.190 --> 03:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
because I mean for me it's like well
 
03:23:57.050 --> 03:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
they've been if they've had credential
 
03:23:59.210 --> 03:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
suspended or revoked I don't really I
 
03:24:02.210 --> 03:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:05.929 --> 03:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
um so we that is a completely separate
 
03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
concept from the criminal history
 
03:24:09.530 --> 03:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
records check okay if someone has
 
03:24:09.540 --> 03:24:10.190 align:start position:0%
records check okay if someone has
um

03:24:10.190 --> 03:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:12.769 --> 03:24:12.779 align:start position:0%
whatever action on the license is not
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
reflective on the criminal history
 
03:24:15.650 --> 03:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
records check
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
um the department does send out the
 
03:24:19.969 --> 03:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
revoked and suspended educator list on a
 
03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
regular basis and it is uh available and
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
then when the person is no longer
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
suspended we remove that person from the
 
03:24:28.250 --> 03:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
list right some superintendents have
 
03:24:29.690 --> 03:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
expressed exactly what you just
 
03:24:32.210 --> 03:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
expressed which is I I don't want to
 
03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
have this so some superintendents as
 
03:24:36.469 --> 03:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
part of their practice hold on to those
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
older lists that's perfectly within
 
03:24:40.490 --> 03:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
their purview from the Department's
 
03:24:42.769 --> 03:24:42.779 align:start position:0%
practice position and the Nei
 
03:24:45.889 --> 03:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
we remove that individual once they are
 
03:24:47.389 --> 03:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
no longer suspended
 
03:24:49.010 --> 03:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you we just want to make sure
 
03:24:50.690 --> 03:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
that once they are no longer suspended
 
03:24:52.130 --> 03:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
their name is off the list there have
 
03:24:53.750 --> 03:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
been cases mistakes in the past where
 
03:24:55.490 --> 03:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
their name has been left on and that's
 
03:24:56.690 --> 03:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
partly why we want to make sure that
 
03:24:59.150 --> 03:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
their name is off like like Dana said
 
03:25:01.010 --> 03:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
it's an employment issue if the
 
03:25:02.690 --> 03:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
superintendent wants to you know hire
 
03:25:04.010 --> 03:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
someone who's been on the list or not
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
for suspension right so up to the
 
03:25:09.170 --> 03:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
district's discretion good thank you
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions represent
 
03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:12.889 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions represent
Belcher

03:25:12.889 --> 03:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
03:25:14.630 --> 03:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:25:17.450 --> 03:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
um obviously I'm a bit newer um and I
 
03:25:19.370 --> 03:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
don't have a full scope of understanding
 
03:25:21.110 --> 03:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the Department's authorities when it
 
03:25:23.030 --> 03:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
comes to this sort of thing you gave an
 
03:25:24.349 --> 03:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
excellent example of somebody who should
 
03:25:25.490 --> 03:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
obviously never be anywhere near
 
03:25:27.650 --> 03:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
children but I'm also curious what are
 
03:25:31.070 --> 03:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
the sort of totality of um Authority the
 
03:25:32.450 --> 03:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
department has when it comes to
 
03:25:34.250 --> 03:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
suspensions and what might the lightest
 
03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
infractions be for which somebody might
 
03:25:38.650 --> 03:25:38.660 align:start position:0%
be suspended
 
03:25:43.790 --> 03:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:46.370 --> 03:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
um it's actually a lot of fun to testify
 
03:25:48.290 --> 03:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
with the Union I wish we we had more of
 
03:25:50.150 --> 03:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
these bills um well it's interesting too
 
03:25:53.090 --> 03:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
he's asking a prosecutor I know right
 
03:25:55.550 --> 03:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
well that was my old job
 
03:25:59.090 --> 03:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
so because the Department issues the
 
03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
credential or the license to teach
 
03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
the department is the exclusive agency
 
03:26:08.210 --> 03:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
that can take action on that document so
 
03:26:11.030 --> 03:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
our Authority if you will only applies
 
03:26:13.550 --> 03:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
to certified Educators so if you are a
 
03:26:15.889 --> 03:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
non-certified para educator
 
03:26:19.130 --> 03:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
we don't have any authority of that
 
03:26:21.290 --> 03:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
um that is separate and apart from
 
03:26:21.300 --> 03:26:24.170 align:start position:0%
um that is separate and apart from
employment

03:26:24.170 --> 03:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:27.290 --> 03:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
and what we have found historically and
 
03:26:30.170 --> 03:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
again if we use that example uh that
 
03:26:32.710 --> 03:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
individual who wrote that love song
 
03:26:35.570 --> 03:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
would would have been and was dealt with
 
03:26:39.469 --> 03:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
employment wise he um offered his
 
03:26:42.050 --> 03:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
resignation it was accepted
 
03:26:44.030 --> 03:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
and the superintendent said quite
 
03:26:46.429 --> 03:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
succinctly I'm done
 
03:26:49.030 --> 03:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
my kids are safe he's out of my district
 
03:26:52.370 --> 03:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
I'm moving on with my life and I asked
 
03:26:55.309 --> 03:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
her one point question which was
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
what about all the other kids
 
03:27:00.110 --> 03:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
where is he going to go
 
03:27:01.729 --> 03:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
what about the children in the next
 
03:27:04.130 --> 03:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
District I myself am a product of New
 
03:27:05.450 --> 03:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public education and my
 
03:27:06.530 --> 03:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
child's in New Hampshire public
 
03:27:08.630 --> 03:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
education please don't send him to my
 
03:27:10.490 --> 03:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
district what about all the other
 
03:27:12.349 --> 03:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
children and that's the Department's
 
03:27:12.359 --> 03:27:14.450 align:start position:0%
children and that's the Department's
purview

03:27:14.450 --> 03:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
purview
 
03:27:18.110 --> 03:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
we have broader jurisdiction we are
 
03:27:19.790 --> 03:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide whereas the superintendent
 
03:27:22.130 --> 03:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
only has Authority in that District
 
03:27:25.309 --> 03:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
representative can speak to that uh more
 
03:27:27.710 --> 03:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
thoroughly than I can however our scope
 
03:27:30.050 --> 03:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
is much narrower and I want to emphasize
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
that so what does that mean there might
 
03:27:34.490 --> 03:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
be a lot of employment infractions that
 
03:27:37.610 --> 03:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
go to the superintendent dress code
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
not having your curriculum in order not
 
03:27:41.870 --> 03:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
having good classroom management skills
 
03:27:45.050 --> 03:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
none of that falls within our radar none
 
03:27:46.070 --> 03:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
of it
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
if it concerns the interactions and
 
03:27:50.330 --> 03:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
safety of a child however
 
03:27:53.710 --> 03:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
then the department steps in so broader
 
03:27:58.969 --> 03:27:58.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:01.490 --> 03:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
go ahead just real quick and that was an
 
03:28:03.050 --> 03:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
excellent response but it brought up one
 
03:28:05.450 --> 03:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
quick idea which is so if it concerns
 
03:28:08.570 --> 03:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
the well-being and sort of What Not of a
 
03:28:11.929 --> 03:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
child would that extend to
 
03:28:14.210 --> 03:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
um things like the social emotional
 
03:28:15.950 --> 03:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
well-being or is this more of a physical
 
03:28:18.530 --> 03:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
threat danger type of a thing threat
 
03:28:21.769 --> 03:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
danger thank you yes further questions
 
03:28:23.690 --> 03:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
03:28:25.610 --> 03:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you it's
 
03:28:28.849 --> 03:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
delightful having both of you together
 
03:28:32.450 --> 03:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
I need a little further understanding on
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
the question of multiple endorsements
 
03:28:35.399 --> 03:28:36.950 align:start position:0%
the question of multiple endorsements
sure

03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:28:39.790 --> 03:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
so from your response to representative
 
03:28:42.769 --> 03:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
cascadden's query
 
03:28:44.630 --> 03:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
I guess I don't really understand why
 
03:28:48.410 --> 03:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
lines eight to ten are in there because
 
03:28:51.849 --> 03:28:51.859 align:start position:0%
I thought I heard you say
 
03:28:51.859 --> 03:28:53.570 align:start position:0%
I thought I heard you say
that

03:28:53.570 --> 03:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:28:57.769 --> 03:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
if your license was suspended or revoked
 
03:29:01.790 --> 03:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:03.710 --> 03:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
it sounded like you said the op to me
 
03:29:05.150 --> 03:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
like you said the opposite of what it
 
03:29:06.410 --> 03:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
says here
 
03:29:06.420 --> 03:29:07.429 align:start position:0%
says here
so

03:29:07.429 --> 03:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:29:09.650 --> 03:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
help me out sure no thank you for the
 
03:29:09.660 --> 03:29:12.110 align:start position:0%
help me out sure no thank you for the
question

03:29:12.110 --> 03:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:14.269 --> 03:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
03:29:16.309 --> 03:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
if the department takes action on a
 
03:29:19.010 --> 03:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
license that includes all endorsement
 
03:29:19.020 --> 03:29:21.590 align:start position:0%
license that includes all endorsement
areas

03:29:21.590 --> 03:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
um two circumstances two instances in
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
which we have said we are going to look
 
03:29:34.370 --> 03:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
at the credential and the endorsements
 
03:29:37.190 --> 03:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
and allow someone to keep a certain
 
03:29:38.929 --> 03:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
endorsement area
 
03:29:41.210 --> 03:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example and I want to
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
just emphasize it's very very rare but
 
03:29:46.729 --> 03:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
Megan was Savvy enough to say let's
 
03:29:48.950 --> 03:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
recognize it even though it might be an
 
03:29:51.710 --> 03:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
anomaly it has happened and I'm sure
 
03:29:52.910 --> 03:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
she's probably thinking in the same
 
03:29:55.190 --> 03:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
cases that I am that's why we put that
 
03:29:56.269 --> 03:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
in here
 
03:29:58.910 --> 03:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
so we have the example I will share with
 
03:30:01.969 --> 03:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
you is we had an educator who
 
03:30:05.570 --> 03:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
um had an endorsement in Special Ed
 
03:30:08.210 --> 03:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
special ed Administration I believe
 
03:30:08.220 --> 03:30:10.070 align:start position:0%
special ed Administration I believe
and

03:30:10.070 --> 03:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:30:12.710 --> 03:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
it was in special ed administration were
 
03:30:15.590 --> 03:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
inappropriate in that
 
03:30:15.600 --> 03:30:16.190 align:start position:0%
inappropriate in that
um

03:30:16.190 --> 03:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:18.410 --> 03:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
it was a misuse of her authority of
 
03:30:20.510 --> 03:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
placing children and it was costing the
 
03:30:20.520 --> 03:30:22.010 align:start position:0%
placing children and it was costing the
district

03:30:22.010 --> 03:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:30:24.050 --> 03:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
thousands if not millions of dollars in
 
03:30:25.969 --> 03:30:25.979 align:start position:0%
violation of regulations
 
03:30:28.490 --> 03:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
and this was systemic and it occurred on
 
03:30:30.290 --> 03:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
a regular basis
 
03:30:30.300 --> 03:30:31.729 align:start position:0%
a regular basis
however

03:30:31.729 --> 03:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:30:33.530 --> 03:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
she was not having an inappropriate
 
03:30:36.050 --> 03:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
relationship with a child
 
03:30:37.849 --> 03:30:37.859 align:start position:0%
and by all accounts in her other
 
03:30:39.410 --> 03:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
endorsement area
 
03:30:42.050 --> 03:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
was an appropriate educator and an
 
03:30:43.969 --> 03:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
effective educator
 
03:30:46.010 --> 03:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
a good educator
 
03:30:48.590 --> 03:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
and that was a very rare occurrence in
 
03:30:51.050 --> 03:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
which we said okay this endorsement area
 
03:30:53.690 --> 03:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
where she has a role of an as an
 
03:30:53.700 --> 03:30:55.309 align:start position:0%
where she has a role of an as an
administrator

03:30:55.309 --> 03:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
03:30:58.729 --> 03:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
that's being used inappropriately
 
03:31:01.190 --> 03:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
she admitted as such
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
and voluntarily gave that endorsement up
 
03:31:07.429 --> 03:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
but we allowed her to stay in the
 
03:31:10.370 --> 03:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
classroom as an educator where she was
 
03:31:14.150 --> 03:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
productive and positive and and by all
 
03:31:14.160 --> 03:31:16.370 align:start position:0%
productive and positive and and by all
accounts

03:31:16.370 --> 03:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
doing good in our schools that doesn't
 
03:31:21.950 --> 03:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
happen every day
 
03:31:25.309 --> 03:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
but the department can and does use that
 
03:31:25.319 --> 03:31:26.570 align:start position:0%
but the department can and does use that
discretion

03:31:26.570 --> 03:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
03:31:28.490 --> 03:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
from time to time
 
03:31:31.190 --> 03:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
um were you thinking of that case okay
 
03:31:34.130 --> 03:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
that's helpful thank you but again very
 
03:31:37.969 --> 03:31:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
does the department share any of this
 
03:31:42.110 --> 03:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
information with our neighboring states
 
03:31:45.650 --> 03:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
Maine Vermont
 
03:31:48.290 --> 03:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in terms of some of the
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
scenarios she was just mentioned so you
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
lose your ticket in this date
 
03:31:54.830 --> 03:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
what happens when they go just a mile
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
away on the other side of the line sure
 
03:31:58.610 --> 03:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's a great question and there's and
 
03:31:59.870 --> 03:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
there's agreement between the states
 
03:32:01.849 --> 03:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
that's when these tickets go back and
 
03:32:03.769 --> 03:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
forth you know you're certified here we
 
03:32:05.269 --> 03:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
accept that certification in our state
 
03:32:07.370 --> 03:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
sure a lot of States Grant reciprocity
 
03:32:07.380 --> 03:32:08.450 align:start position:0%
sure a lot of States Grant reciprocity
yeah

03:32:08.450 --> 03:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
um so there is a national group
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
um the group is NASDAQ National Stock
 
03:32:18.050 --> 03:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
Market not the stock market I spent the
 
03:32:19.729 --> 03:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
six first six months in my job thinking
 
03:32:21.710 --> 03:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
it was the stock market it is a national
 
03:32:25.010 --> 03:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
group and it is designed and created to
 
03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
address the exact issue that
 
03:32:29.809 --> 03:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd just asked about and
 
03:32:32.570 --> 03:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
so you have to be a member of NASDAQ the
 
03:32:33.889 --> 03:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is a member of
 
03:32:35.690 --> 03:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
NASDAQ what does that mean that means
 
03:32:36.960 --> 03:32:36.970 align:start position:0%
when someone comes
 
03:32:36.970 --> 03:32:38.030 align:start position:0%
when someone comes
[Music]

03:32:38.030 --> 03:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:32:40.309 --> 03:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire from another state
 
03:32:42.590 --> 03:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
to get certified as an educator New
 
03:32:44.330 --> 03:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education will
 
03:32:46.190 --> 03:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
run that individual's name and social
 
03:32:49.010 --> 03:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
security number through NASDAQ
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
to see if they have had action taken on
 
03:32:53.870 --> 03:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
their teaching license in another state
 
03:32:56.530 --> 03:32:56.540 align:start position:0%
that's all 50 states
 
03:32:59.990 --> 03:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
and when we take action we will enter
 
03:33:02.809 --> 03:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
that individual into NASDAQ
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:09.170 --> 03:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
um people will enter when they're able
 
03:33:11.210 --> 03:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
to if they're members but it is pretty
 
03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh all-inclusive and it we have had some
 
03:33:16.790 --> 03:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
success with that so we we have gotten
 
03:33:19.370 --> 03:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
calls from other states saying someone
 
03:33:20.870 --> 03:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
has moved here they want a teaching
 
03:33:22.849 --> 03:33:22.859 align:start position:0%
license we see you've taken action what
 
03:33:24.889 --> 03:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
were the grounds for that
 
03:33:27.290 --> 03:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
what's the story behind that I will also
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
just share with you it's a tad off topic
 
03:33:31.969 --> 03:33:31.979 align:start position:0%
but this um legislative body helped to
 
03:33:34.130 --> 03:33:34.140 align:start position:0%
pass it when the Department issues a
 
03:33:37.550 --> 03:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
license to teach they also run a Check
 
03:33:40.190 --> 03:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
of the individual's name into the New
 
03:33:43.250 --> 03:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dcyf essential registry that
 
03:33:44.750 --> 03:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
is a tool that this legislative body
 
03:33:47.809 --> 03:33:47.819 align:start position:0%
helped to pass so we are now doing that
 
03:33:49.790 --> 03:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
and we are working towards doing that in
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
our sister States namely Massachusetts
 
03:33:53.929 --> 03:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
as well that's a tool that a school
 
03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
district does not have
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
so the state agency is taking the lead
 
03:34:01.010 --> 03:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
on that to say when we license we have
 
03:34:04.429 --> 03:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
we will assure you that that person is
 
03:34:06.469 --> 03:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
not in those databases
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
and we're very proud of that initiative
 
03:34:12.050 --> 03:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh further questions
 
03:34:16.610 --> 03:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:23.030 --> 03:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:25.370 --> 03:34:25.380 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's nice so with that
 
03:34:27.710 --> 03:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to close this hearing
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
and move on to the next scheduled
 
03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
hearing which we have today that's
 
03:34:34.130 --> 03:34:34.140 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 1 30 in a couple minutes
 
03:34:35.710 --> 03:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
we'll start that up
 
03:34:38.030 --> 03:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
relative to New Hampshire Workforce
 
03:35:46.610 --> 03:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:46.620 --> 03:35:57.670 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:35:57.670 --> 03:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:01.250 --> 03:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
okay can you please go ahead and protect
 
03:36:02.769 --> 03:36:02.779 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:36:05.570 --> 03:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh Mr Vice
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm Senator David Waters
 
03:36:08.710 --> 03:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
District Four to introduce Senate Bill
 
03:36:11.389 --> 03:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
152 relative natural Workforce training
 
03:36:13.309 --> 03:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
programs and uh we're all trying to do
 
03:36:15.110 --> 03:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
something about Workforce and uh here's
 
03:36:16.729 --> 03:36:16.739 align:start position:0%
a bill that can address a couple of
 
03:36:17.990 --> 03:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
areas you get you're going to get two
 
03:36:20.269 --> 03:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
Workforce uh developments for the price
 
03:36:21.950 --> 03:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
of one in this bill
 
03:36:24.530 --> 03:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
um I want to thank very much Jeff beard
 
03:36:27.229 --> 03:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education who heads
 
03:36:29.210 --> 03:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
up the CTE programs and particularly
 
03:36:31.250 --> 03:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
want to thank commissioner Ada blue for
 
03:36:33.229 --> 03:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
all of his uh work on figuring out how
 
03:36:36.530 --> 03:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
to make this both parts of this build
 
03:36:38.450 --> 03:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
um work so the first part of the bill is
 
03:36:40.870 --> 03:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
going to establish a pathway for marine
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
trades at one of our ctes and um
 
03:36:49.969 --> 03:36:49.979 align:start position:0%
this uh arose initially out of
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
um the Marine trades and marinas up in
 
03:36:55.190 --> 03:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
the Lakes Region who are facing a real
 
03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
critical shortage of workers and are
 
03:36:58.790 --> 03:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
really concerned about how to get a
 
03:37:01.969 --> 03:37:01.979 align:start position:0%
pathway for uh training in that area and
 
03:37:04.370 --> 03:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
you know part of it is that a lot of the
 
03:37:06.229 --> 03:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
um Automotive programs which you might
 
03:37:08.030 --> 03:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
think you know engines or engines but a
 
03:37:09.769 --> 03:37:09.779 align:start position:0%
lot of the students in the automotive
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
programs are really want to do cars so
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
the idea is that if we establish a
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
pathway so that they could have a
 
03:37:17.710 --> 03:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
sequence of courses in this area
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
internships other opportunities for
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
students to get out into the marinas
 
03:37:24.610 --> 03:37:24.620 align:start position:0%
that that would be a good way to go
 
03:37:28.429 --> 03:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
there's a considerable demand for these
 
03:37:31.429 --> 03:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh workers that's the workforce is aging
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
out Marine trades is generally a growth
 
03:37:35.210 --> 03:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
industry whether it's up along the lakes
 
03:37:38.750 --> 03:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
or along the coast and it empowers the
 
03:37:40.130 --> 03:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and specifically
 
03:37:41.929 --> 03:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
commissioner Ada blue and director of
 
03:37:43.490 --> 03:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
Career and Technical education to
 
03:37:48.130 --> 03:37:48.140 align:start position:0%
establish the pathway I didn't specify
 
03:37:50.990 --> 03:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
a particular Center I think it's likely
 
03:37:53.030 --> 03:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
to start up in the in the Lakes Region
 
03:37:54.349 --> 03:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
there's also good cooperation between
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
the CTE up there and um the Community
 
03:37:58.969 --> 03:37:58.979 align:start position:0%
College because I do think that
 
03:38:00.110 --> 03:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
eventually there'll probably be an
 
03:38:01.670 --> 03:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
interest in doing one of these on a Sea
 
03:38:03.950 --> 03:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
Coast as well for marine trades
 
03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:10.190 --> 03:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
um and uh there are existing facilities
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
at these centers that could handle the
 
03:38:14.330 --> 03:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
program so we're not looking for
 
03:38:16.190 --> 03:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
um any kind of appropriation outside of
 
03:38:17.809 --> 03:38:17.819 align:start position:0%
you know if there are some funds needed
 
03:38:18.950 --> 03:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's a grant program that the
 
03:38:20.809 --> 03:38:20.819 align:start position:0%
commissioner has that any Center can
 
03:38:23.330 --> 03:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
apply to for any any reason
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I think you're going to see that a
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
lot of local Business Leaders uh from
 
03:38:28.729 --> 03:38:28.739 align:start position:0%
the marinas and elsewhere really want to
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
want this track
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
um to work and I will also notice
 
03:38:34.190 --> 03:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
because of actions taken in the
 
03:38:35.570 --> 03:38:35.580 align:start position:0%
legislature that there is a tax credit
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
program for
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
um businesses that want to contribute
 
03:38:41.570 --> 03:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
equipment to the ctes or staff time for
 
03:38:43.610 --> 03:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
training they can get a tax credit by
 
03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
working with the CTE so I suspect
 
03:38:49.190 --> 03:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
that'll be a nice incentive uh as well
 
03:38:50.870 --> 03:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
um the other part of the bill deals the
 
03:38:52.010 --> 03:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
offshore wind
 
03:38:54.410 --> 03:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
industry and I'll just tell you you know
 
03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
explain why we need to do this right
 
03:38:58.370 --> 03:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
right now and how I put the bill
 
03:39:00.889 --> 03:39:00.899 align:start position:0%
together I'm chair of our New Hampshire
 
03:39:02.210 --> 03:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
offshore wind
 
03:39:04.670 --> 03:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh important development commission uh
 
03:39:07.309 --> 03:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu three years three four
 
03:39:09.769 --> 03:39:09.779 align:start position:0%
years ago now um was the governor who
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
called for the creation of Gulf of Maine
 
03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
task force for offshore wind industry
 
03:39:15.309 --> 03:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
composed of Massachusetts New Hampshire
 
03:39:18.229 --> 03:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
and uh Massachusetts
 
03:39:21.410 --> 03:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
um this is a huge industry uh it is uh
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
enormous financial support from the
 
03:39:25.849 --> 03:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
industry and from other sources if you
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
look around it's certainly developing
 
03:39:29.450 --> 03:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
very quickly along Southern New England
 
03:39:31.010 --> 03:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
coast and up and down the east coast and
 
03:39:34.729 --> 03:39:34.739 align:start position:0%
now off of California and Oregon as well
 
03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
um the plans are for about 3.2 gigawatts
 
03:39:40.849 --> 03:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
in the initial energy development field
 
03:39:43.130 --> 03:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
out in the Gulf of Maine Gulf of Maine
 
03:39:45.229 --> 03:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
has been called the Saudi Arabia of wind
 
03:39:46.729 --> 03:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
because we have extraordinary wind
 
03:39:49.490 --> 03:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
resources out there that would power
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
that's about 3C Brooks so we're talking
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
about you know one and a half million
 
03:39:55.429 --> 03:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
homes potentially powered by it in a lot
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
of Industry as well about a three three
 
03:40:00.410 --> 03:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
to five billion dollar construction
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
phase about a 12 to 16 billion dollar
 
03:40:05.690 --> 03:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
supply chain so the industry is chopping
 
03:40:07.729 --> 03:40:07.739 align:start position:0%
at the bit to get a Workforce and to get
 
03:40:10.910 --> 03:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
these Investments made for New Hampshire
 
03:40:14.330 --> 03:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of Maine auctions the they've
 
03:40:16.490 --> 03:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
just established the lease auction areas
 
03:40:18.530 --> 03:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
the final map was released just a few
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
weeks ago and now there are five
 
03:40:22.610 --> 03:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
developers are going to bid into those
 
03:40:25.610 --> 03:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
auctions on third quarter of next year
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
which in terms of the industry is really
 
03:40:28.490 --> 03:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so they're going to start
 
03:40:31.010 --> 03:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
looking at ports they can use and how
 
03:40:33.710 --> 03:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to get a Workforce for it
 
03:40:36.050 --> 03:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
so that's the impetus behind the bill is
 
03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
that we need to get ready on doing some
 
03:40:42.170 --> 03:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh Workforce
 
03:40:45.349 --> 03:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
um on development now you'll see what
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
the bill does then it establishes a fund
 
03:40:49.790 --> 03:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
so they can we receive non-state
 
03:40:52.309 --> 03:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and come into this fund I
 
03:40:54.590 --> 03:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
will say at this point that the industry
 
03:40:56.090 --> 03:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
has already put tens of millions of
 
03:40:58.010 --> 03:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
dollars into similar training facilities
 
03:41:00.650 --> 03:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
in Southern New England and up and down
 
03:41:03.190 --> 03:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
the east coast and elsewhere
 
03:41:07.969 --> 03:41:07.979 align:start position:0%
the IRA act has many billions of dollars
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
of funding for Workforce Development and
 
03:41:12.769 --> 03:41:12.779 align:start position:0%
also apparently there's a new
 
03:41:15.530 --> 03:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
requirement for offshore wind auctions
 
03:41:19.010 --> 03:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
of five percent of the auctions being
 
03:41:21.170 --> 03:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
dedicated towards Workforce Development
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
the most recent auctions were held were
 
03:41:26.030 --> 03:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
for floating offshore wind which is what
 
03:41:28.010 --> 03:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to have out off the coast of
 
03:41:28.020 --> 03:41:29.090 align:start position:0%
we're going to have out off the coast of
California

03:41:29.090 --> 03:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
California
 
03:41:31.610 --> 03:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
and the average price for the three
 
03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
loose areas just about the same size
 
03:41:35.389 --> 03:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is about 160 570
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars so you can do the math
 
03:41:38.929 --> 03:41:38.939 align:start position:0%
and five percent of that we're going to
 
03:41:40.969 --> 03:41:40.979 align:start position:0%
have some real money coming in for for
 
03:41:42.530 --> 03:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
Workforce training so we got to set up a
 
03:41:45.229 --> 03:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
fund um so we can receive those funds
 
03:41:47.750 --> 03:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then a process whereby the
 
03:41:50.570 --> 03:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
commission of education and the Bia and
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
the industry
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
um Department of Employment Security
 
03:41:56.389 --> 03:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
community college system University
 
03:41:56.399 --> 03:41:57.950 align:start position:0%
community college system University
system

03:41:57.950 --> 03:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
um other entities such as unions the
 
03:42:02.990 --> 03:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
industries that are going to emerge in
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire manufacturing around this
 
03:42:06.349 --> 03:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
industry they're going to be
 
03:42:08.330 --> 03:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
Consolidated together and say what do we
 
03:42:11.690 --> 03:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
need uh in this in this and then there's
 
03:42:13.849 --> 03:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
going to be you'll see on page two
 
03:42:16.490 --> 03:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
we've set up this um Training Center
 
03:42:19.250 --> 03:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
committee which I think has all the
 
03:42:21.769 --> 03:42:21.779 align:start position:0%
people on or who wanted to be on it and
 
03:42:24.110 --> 03:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
are appropriate to
 
03:42:28.010 --> 03:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
be on it um so that this group uh can
 
03:42:29.809 --> 03:42:29.819 align:start position:0%
make some determinations
 
03:42:31.550 --> 03:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
um about recommendations on Workforce
 
03:42:33.410 --> 03:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
training you know what what trade should
 
03:42:35.269 --> 03:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
be focused on
 
03:42:39.229 --> 03:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
um particularly uh to pick a site there
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
are several possibilities
 
03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
the feeling is after conversation with
 
03:42:45.349 --> 03:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
Great Bay Community College and others
 
03:42:47.570 --> 03:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
that this ought to be at the Port so
 
03:42:49.670 --> 03:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
Gina Marconi or the Port Authority is
 
03:42:51.170 --> 03:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
interested we could have facility there
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
Granite Shore power which some of you
 
03:42:56.150 --> 03:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
may know in Newington has a lot of land
 
03:42:58.610 --> 03:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
they have some plans to develop some
 
03:43:01.250 --> 03:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
very large facilities there warehouses
 
03:43:02.750 --> 03:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
and other training facilities so it
 
03:43:04.790 --> 03:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
could be there or one of the empty
 
03:43:06.650 --> 03:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
buildings over at the mall are all
 
03:43:09.530 --> 03:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
Targets for of Interest around around
 
03:43:09.540 --> 03:43:11.870 align:start position:0%
Targets for of Interest around around
that

03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:43:14.809 --> 03:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
um and uh so potentially um you know
 
03:43:17.330 --> 03:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
money from the industry and elsewhere to
 
03:43:18.889 --> 03:43:18.899 align:start position:0%
figure out where to where to do this
 
03:43:21.710 --> 03:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
what what is appropriate to build and uh
 
03:43:24.410 --> 03:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
and who to train there
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
um so you see the bill is crafted not to
 
03:43:28.670 --> 03:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
require State appropriation at this uh
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
time we're going to get reports both on
 
03:43:34.729 --> 03:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
the activities of that group and on any
 
03:43:36.830 --> 03:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
fund activities as well you see that on
 
03:43:38.750 --> 03:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
page three pretty much weight language
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
for the way we handle uh handle funds
 
03:43:46.969 --> 03:43:46.979 align:start position:0%
um I just didn't in conclusion will say
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
I think this is an extraordinary
 
03:43:52.070 --> 03:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for New Hampshire good high
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
paying jobs extraordinary amounts of
 
03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
energy that's going to likely to come in
 
03:43:58.309 --> 03:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
at a much cheaper supply of energies
 
03:44:00.290 --> 03:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
than any other source that uh that we
 
03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
have available to us and um I don't want
 
03:44:04.849 --> 03:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
all those jobs going to Massachusetts in
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
May and I want them right here in New
 
03:44:12.530 --> 03:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
of course
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for being here and
 
03:44:18.410 --> 03:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward
 
03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
if this bill were signed into law what
 
03:44:22.790 --> 03:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
would be the timeline for training
 
03:44:25.130 --> 03:44:25.140 align:start position:0%
Educators acquiring a location getting
 
03:44:26.690 --> 03:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
all the resources and really getting
 
03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
this program off the ground
 
03:44:30.110 --> 03:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's your question
 
03:44:30.120 --> 03:44:31.429 align:start position:0%
that's your question
um

03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
I mean Marine trades program I think
 
03:44:34.670 --> 03:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
we're going right away the one up in the
 
03:44:37.190 --> 03:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region on the other other part
 
03:44:37.200 --> 03:44:38.210 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region on the other other part
here

03:44:38.210 --> 03:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:44:38.220 --> 03:44:38.990 align:start position:0%
here
um

03:44:38.990 --> 03:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:41.330 --> 03:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to speculate just a little
 
03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
bit okay so if the auctions are coming
 
03:44:43.680 --> 03:44:44.809 align:start position:0%
bit okay so if the auctions are coming
up

03:44:44.809 --> 03:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:44:46.849 --> 03:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
third quarter next year
 
03:44:49.250 --> 03:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
I think we're gonna we're already seeing
 
03:44:50.690 --> 03:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
the industry looking around New
 
03:44:52.070 --> 03:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's an office that's been
 
03:44:55.250 --> 03:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
opened up in Boston by uh
 
03:44:56.450 --> 03:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
um one of the biggest
 
03:44:58.910 --> 03:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
um energy developers in this area and
 
03:45:00.349 --> 03:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
there's actually three of them already
 
03:45:01.969 --> 03:45:01.979 align:start position:0%
have offices there and they're looking
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
around we had an offshore wind Summit
 
03:45:07.429 --> 03:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
um last spring I should mention uh
 
03:45:09.769 --> 03:45:09.779 align:start position:0%
assistant Des commissioner Mark Sanborn
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
who's the governor's Point person
 
03:45:13.309 --> 03:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
offshore wind he's down at offshore wind
 
03:45:14.929 --> 03:45:14.939 align:start position:0%
industry meetings down in New Jersey
 
03:45:16.250 --> 03:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
right now otherwise I think he would
 
03:45:18.170 --> 03:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
have been would have been here
 
03:45:20.330 --> 03:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
um and I right now we're trying through
 
03:45:22.910 --> 03:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
our office of offshore wind in business
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs trying to talk to folks
 
03:45:28.010 --> 03:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's very possible next
 
03:45:29.570 --> 03:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
year we'll start to see some real action
 
03:45:34.150 --> 03:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:36.410 --> 03:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:45:38.150 --> 03:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:45:40.309 --> 03:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
um does this have a connection or a link
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
to Community College or is this industry
 
03:45:45.050 --> 03:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
ready to hire high school graduates that
 
03:45:47.690 --> 03:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
have gone through this Marines trades
 
03:45:47.700 --> 03:45:49.130 align:start position:0%
have gone through this Marines trades
program

03:45:49.130 --> 03:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:45:51.050 --> 03:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
um all of the above
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
um Great Bay Community College and a
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
Consortium of ctes are going to be very
 
03:45:57.170 --> 03:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
important here
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the sea Grant operation at uh
 
03:46:01.849 --> 03:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire is empowered
 
03:46:04.309 --> 03:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
by federal statute to work on Workforce
 
03:46:06.469 --> 03:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
Development so they're they're at the
 
03:46:09.290 --> 03:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
table here as well and um the kind of
 
03:46:10.670 --> 03:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
jobs I mean it's everything from from
 
03:46:14.990 --> 03:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care uh to manufacturing to
 
03:46:18.290 --> 03:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
um you know divers if you have a welding
 
03:46:20.269 --> 03:46:20.279 align:start position:0%
and if you if you have welding out of
 
03:46:23.030 --> 03:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
CTE and a diver certificate you started
 
03:46:25.969 --> 03:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
like 150 000 a year plus benefits so um
 
03:46:27.410 --> 03:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
and then plus everything everybody else
 
03:46:30.790 --> 03:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
seeing my thing on electrical servicing
 
03:46:33.530 --> 03:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh you know the servicing the industry
 
03:46:36.290 --> 03:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
getting workers out there so I think
 
03:46:37.370 --> 03:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
there's going to be opportunities for
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
all levels but the hot you know I want
 
03:46:41.690 --> 03:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
us to get the good paying jobs and so
 
03:46:44.330 --> 03:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
the student who goes through CTE if they
 
03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
are are welding electrical manufacturing
 
03:46:48.110 --> 03:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
kinds of programs they're going to be
 
03:46:49.969 --> 03:46:49.979 align:start position:0%
well positioned to get additional
 
03:46:52.849 --> 03:46:52.859 align:start position:0%
training specific to the industry and
 
03:46:54.650 --> 03:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
then of course the seat the Community
 
03:46:57.050 --> 03:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
College programs that we have existing
 
03:46:59.330 --> 03:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
in in the area is going to be hireable
 
03:47:01.190 --> 03:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
here so
 
03:47:05.389 --> 03:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:06.769 --> 03:47:06.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:47:08.750 --> 03:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
03:47:10.849 --> 03:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
so generally with CTE programs I'm I'm
 
03:47:12.410 --> 03:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
pretty excited about the idea of them I
 
03:47:14.510 --> 03:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
like the idea that our students are
 
03:47:16.849 --> 03:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
getting trained to do jobs but I also
 
03:47:18.290 --> 03:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
think because the you know obviously the
 
03:47:19.729 --> 03:47:19.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxpayer is footing the
 
03:47:22.190 --> 03:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
bill the overall they should overall see
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
a benefit from it so I have a little bit
 
03:47:25.250 --> 03:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
of a concern and I'm hoping you can
 
03:47:27.710 --> 03:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
speak to that on the wind energy portion
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
of it because I I know when I'm looking
 
03:47:31.610 --> 03:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
at some of the stats wind energy being
 
03:47:34.309 --> 03:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
per unit of energy produced one of the
 
03:47:37.190 --> 03:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
highest subsidized types of energy right
 
03:47:39.290 --> 03:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
now is this not effectively another
 
03:47:42.349 --> 03:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
subsidy for wind energy
 
03:47:44.510 --> 03:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
oh I mean it's it's an interesting
 
03:47:46.849 --> 03:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
argument you know in that um clearly
 
03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:47:51.229 --> 03:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of funding support for
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
this industry in the ira
 
03:47:56.809 --> 03:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
and in other incentives being offered I
 
03:47:59.150 --> 03:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
think the kind of recognition is that as
 
03:48:00.229 --> 03:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
the price
 
03:48:02.510 --> 03:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh and the supply chain you know as
 
03:48:04.210 --> 03:48:04.220 align:start position:0%
we're starting to build these
 
03:48:07.190 --> 03:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
that the necessity of those kinds of
 
03:48:09.769 --> 03:48:09.779 align:start position:0%
support for industry and for renewable
 
03:48:11.570 --> 03:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
energy standards
 
03:48:13.910 --> 03:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
um may change I will say right now
 
03:48:15.650 --> 03:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
though for New Hampshire's perspective
 
03:48:17.809 --> 03:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
that we are not a state that is
 
03:48:20.150 --> 03:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
providing direct subsidies here right
 
03:48:21.410 --> 03:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
because other other you know
 
03:48:23.389 --> 03:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts another removal forefoose
 
03:48:25.490 --> 03:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
standards and we have not decided to do
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
that so I think our taxpayers actually
 
03:48:30.710 --> 03:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
stand to really benefit greatly uh from
 
03:48:36.769 --> 03:48:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for answering all
 
03:48:40.010 --> 03:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
these questions
 
03:48:41.929 --> 03:48:41.939 align:start position:0%
um just to follow up on what the
 
03:48:43.610 --> 03:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
representative is saying
 
03:48:46.309 --> 03:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
the offshore wind industry is big but
 
03:48:49.309 --> 03:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
it's not just in New Hampshire so
 
03:48:51.530 --> 03:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
is the committee going to look at how to
 
03:48:54.050 --> 03:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
keep keep our Workforce here I mean or
 
03:48:56.570 --> 03:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
incentives to to just use the training
 
03:48:58.849 --> 03:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
where they got it yes thanks for your
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
question representative I mean it's a
 
03:49:02.150 --> 03:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
great question I think a lot of the jobs
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
are likely to be local and you know the
 
03:49:06.590 --> 03:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
construction phase those folks the
 
03:49:09.729 --> 03:49:09.739 align:start position:0%
construction phase will will be done and
 
03:49:12.650 --> 03:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's like with our um you
 
03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
know Local ibw 104 workers the people
 
03:49:18.290 --> 03:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
who do the high wires that's a mobile
 
03:49:20.750 --> 03:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce and some people New Hampshire
 
03:49:22.969 --> 03:49:22.979 align:start position:0%
already now training down in New Bedford
 
03:49:25.250 --> 03:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
and then they come up they'll come up
 
03:49:26.690 --> 03:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
here and do this work so you know
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
there's some Mobility they go over the
 
03:49:30.650 --> 03:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
gonna go where the jobs are
 
03:49:33.650 --> 03:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
um but I what I fear the most is that if
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
we don't train a Workforce they're going
 
03:49:37.010 --> 03:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
to bring in European workers
 
03:49:39.530 --> 03:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
and uh because the industry is far more
 
03:49:42.410 --> 03:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
advanced in in Europe than it is here so
 
03:49:42.420 --> 03:49:43.130 align:start position:0%
advanced in in Europe than it is here so
um

03:49:43.130 --> 03:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:44.809 --> 03:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
you know I I think we have an
 
03:49:45.950 --> 03:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity here I think there's going
 
03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of ongoing jobs uh there'll
 
03:49:50.330 --> 03:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
probably be a second phase to the Gulf
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
of Maine 10 years or so from now so um
 
03:49:55.190 --> 03:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's a Marketplace though isn't
 
03:49:56.870 --> 03:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
it you know it's the industry is the
 
03:49:59.150 --> 03:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
industry and uh I just want to make sure
 
03:50:01.250 --> 03:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire says we're open for
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
business and we want some good jobs here
 
03:50:05.570 --> 03:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
and um the business the industry will
 
03:50:11.269 --> 03:50:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:12.769 --> 03:50:12.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
another one of my questions
 
03:50:17.570 --> 03:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
some other programs such as the Health
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
Sciences students can graduate with like
 
03:50:22.490 --> 03:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
an l a certificate or EMT license would
 
03:50:24.590 --> 03:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
there be a certificate at the end of
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
this program to give students a
 
03:50:27.590 --> 03:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
competitive advantage in entering the
 
03:50:29.450 --> 03:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
workforce is there something in this
 
03:50:31.490 --> 03:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
field like that
 
03:50:33.050 --> 03:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question I would hope so
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know health care workers um even you
 
03:50:37.849 --> 03:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
know um catering you know there's all
 
03:50:39.950 --> 03:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of jobs here but the health the
 
03:50:42.410 --> 03:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
health health and safety kind of um jobs
 
03:50:44.450 --> 03:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
are very important to the industry and
 
03:50:46.490 --> 03:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know I would think you work for this
 
03:50:48.050 --> 03:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
you've got a great credential you maybe
 
03:50:49.849 --> 03:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
you want to go on to another
 
03:50:52.130 --> 03:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
another project like this or maybe
 
03:50:53.450 --> 03:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
you're going to work for one of the
 
03:50:55.309 --> 03:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals or for another for another
 
03:50:55.319 --> 03:50:56.330 align:start position:0%
hospitals or for another for another
business

03:50:56.330 --> 03:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:50:56.340 --> 03:50:57.590 align:start position:0%
business
um

03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:59.450 --> 03:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
and I just think it's I think these are
 
03:51:01.610 --> 03:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
great opportunities and uh we gotta we
 
03:51:04.429 --> 03:51:04.439 align:start position:0%
got to do a Workforce uh uh trying to
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
increase the workforce and Healthcare
 
03:51:07.450 --> 03:51:07.460 align:start position:0%
here too don't we yes
 
03:51:12.469 --> 03:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:14.809 --> 03:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you Senator Waters
 
03:51:17.929 --> 03:51:17.939 align:start position:0%
just wondering currently where these
 
03:51:19.610 --> 03:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
opportunities don't exist in New
 
03:51:19.620 --> 03:51:21.050 align:start position:0%
opportunities don't exist in New
Hampshire

03:51:21.050 --> 03:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:51:24.290 --> 03:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
where do people get this training if
 
03:51:25.910 --> 03:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
this weren't to happen where are people
 
03:51:25.920 --> 03:51:26.929 align:start position:0%
this weren't to happen where are people
going

03:51:26.929 --> 03:51:26.939 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:51:28.849 --> 03:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
well education part is actually the
 
03:51:30.530 --> 03:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
question in the industry
 
03:51:32.330 --> 03:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
um you know Massachusetts and connecting
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
around do their laws a little bit
 
03:51:35.330 --> 03:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
different and the nicer to Coalition
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
which is New York New Jersey you know
 
03:51:39.950 --> 03:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
all the places where offshore industry
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
developing I'll do a little bit
 
03:51:42.710 --> 03:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
different about how their training
 
03:51:44.570 --> 03:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
worker in education and and what kinds
 
03:51:46.309 --> 03:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
of money and incentives
 
03:51:47.750 --> 03:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
um because of the way they did some of
 
03:51:49.370 --> 03:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
their contract done in Massachusetts I
 
03:51:51.469 --> 03:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
think is like 40 million is in for
 
03:51:53.090 --> 03:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
Workforce training
 
03:51:55.429 --> 03:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
um at Mass Maritime
 
03:51:57.710 --> 03:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
and in New Bedford
 
03:51:59.150 --> 03:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
um if you go to the port of Portsmouth
 
03:52:00.710 --> 03:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh Porter
 
03:52:00.720 --> 03:52:01.550 align:start position:0%
uh Porter
um

03:52:01.550 --> 03:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
Providence you'll see Workforce training
 
03:52:06.889 --> 03:52:06.899 align:start position:0%
centers there that are that are run by
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
the industry and by the unions so
 
03:52:11.570 --> 03:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different models there
 
03:52:13.309 --> 03:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
and as I said some of our workers are
 
03:52:16.309 --> 03:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
going down there to get training now
 
03:52:17.809 --> 03:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
um but the demand is going to be here
 
03:52:20.030 --> 03:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
too now I the model I put together here
 
03:52:21.530 --> 03:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
is a New Hampshire model
 
03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:23.279 align:start position:0%
we have to get everybody at the table
 
03:52:24.670 --> 03:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
the Bia
 
03:52:27.229 --> 03:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner education Community
 
03:52:29.690 --> 03:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
College is the University get the unions
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
in there because all their you know
 
03:52:32.630 --> 03:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
they're training
 
03:52:34.849 --> 03:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
begins to train a lot of folks and why
 
03:52:36.349 --> 03:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
have duplicate efforts let's see if we
 
03:52:38.330 --> 03:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
can get them the ctes get everybody
 
03:52:40.490 --> 03:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
together and figure out how we're going
 
03:52:41.870 --> 03:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
to train our workers best so we're going
 
03:52:43.729 --> 03:52:43.739 align:start position:0%
to have our own model and the idea is
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
that we're going to get the money in
 
03:52:47.090 --> 03:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
from the feds and from the industry and
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're you know once the
 
03:52:50.389 --> 03:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
auctions happen next
 
03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
year that's when I think we'll start to
 
03:52:58.330 --> 03:52:58.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I don't know
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
understand enough about the the
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
windforce one I don't understand what
 
03:53:07.849 --> 03:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
the auctions are oh excuse me
 
03:53:11.229 --> 03:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
so um the Bureau of energy ocean
 
03:53:14.330 --> 03:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
management or Bureau of ocean Energy
 
03:53:16.729 --> 03:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
Management volume as we call it
 
03:53:19.250 --> 03:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
um is the lead agency from the federal
 
03:53:22.070 --> 03:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
government for offshore wind development
 
03:53:24.830 --> 03:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
because these are you know they're these
 
03:53:25.790 --> 03:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
are going to be out in federal waters
 
03:53:28.370 --> 03:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
like 40 40 50 miles out
 
03:53:30.050 --> 03:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
um we're going to ensure the power so we
 
03:53:31.729 --> 03:53:31.739 align:start position:0%
have state some State authority over it
 
03:53:34.370 --> 03:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
as well so what they do is they set up a
 
03:53:37.070 --> 03:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
task force process where there's a gulf
 
03:53:39.349 --> 03:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
of Maine task force and that has dozens
 
03:53:40.929 --> 03:53:40.939 align:start position:0%
of people on it from the three states
 
03:53:44.330 --> 03:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
and the government agencies and so forth
 
03:53:47.229 --> 03:53:47.239 align:start position:0%
and so the process is not only
 
03:53:50.690 --> 03:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
developing the auction leases defining
 
03:53:52.729 --> 03:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
what area out in the Gulf of Maine is
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
suitable environmentally for the
 
03:53:58.610 --> 03:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
Fisheries for Homeland Security for the
 
03:54:03.110 --> 03:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
Navy the Coast Guard Transit Lanes I
 
03:54:04.969 --> 03:54:04.979 align:start position:0%
mean you name it it's complicated bottom
 
03:54:07.630 --> 03:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
out there so they Define those areas
 
03:54:10.550 --> 03:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
that are would be available
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
and then they have lease auctions where
 
03:54:14.929 --> 03:54:14.939 align:start position:0%
you bid
 
03:54:17.389 --> 03:54:17.399 align:start position:0%
to have the right to develop a certain
 
03:54:20.929 --> 03:54:20.939 align:start position:0%
part of that real estate the most recent
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
auctions down in New York went out for
 
03:54:26.150 --> 03:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
3.2 billion dollars
 
03:54:27.650 --> 03:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
um that was a little high I think
 
03:54:28.969 --> 03:54:28.979 align:start position:0%
they're good and they're going to have
 
03:54:31.250 --> 03:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
maybe a little trouble
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
um but doing that you know for that that
 
03:54:37.309 --> 03:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
price is just the entry level but uh set
 
03:54:40.189 --> 03:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
out out in California it's quite similar
 
03:54:44.450 --> 03:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
to us 160 570 million uh per loose area
 
03:54:46.370 --> 03:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
so the auction will be held would be an
 
03:54:48.590 --> 03:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
open auction people will bid and they'll
 
03:54:50.630 --> 03:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
select the winners and and the bids will
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
will have all you know have got the
 
03:54:54.469 --> 03:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
environmental the workforce the
 
03:54:56.269 --> 03:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
relationship with the states outlined in
 
03:54:58.490 --> 03:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
the the bid and then they'll go they'll
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
be awarded a bid and then that that
 
03:55:03.469 --> 03:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
starts to several your process of um of
 
03:55:05.689 --> 03:55:05.699 align:start position:0%
environmental review
 
03:55:06.769 --> 03:55:06.779 align:start position:0%
um work about how you're going to
 
03:55:09.490 --> 03:55:09.500 align:start position:0%
onshore the power I mean you name it so
 
03:55:14.269 --> 03:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:16.969 --> 03:55:16.979 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Cornell
 
03:55:21.410 --> 03:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
so yeah how long do the leases last once
 
03:55:27.650 --> 03:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:28.910 --> 03:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember it was 20 years
 
03:55:30.710 --> 03:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
or 30 years
 
03:55:33.170 --> 03:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
something like that okay yeah
 
03:55:34.790 --> 03:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
which is kind of the lifespan of the
 
03:55:36.769 --> 03:55:36.779 align:start position:0%
equipment now they they can always
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
replace them but um you know the the
 
03:55:41.450 --> 03:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's it's that period
 
03:55:41.460 --> 03:55:43.729 align:start position:0%
it's it's that period
hmm

03:55:43.729 --> 03:55:43.739 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
03:55:47.150 --> 03:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
my question is it's just pretty concern
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
that I do have regarding
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
all the equipments are in your dark
 
03:55:55.010 --> 03:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
enough is that offshore
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's not like they have an Ellenberg a
 
03:56:00.530 --> 03:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
lot of champagne or Bangor New York
 
03:56:02.990 --> 03:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
I can't but it looks like he went
 
03:56:05.450 --> 03:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
through a poverty-stricken area with the
 
03:56:08.090 --> 03:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
power of the turbines are there people
 
03:56:14.210 --> 03:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:16.309 --> 03:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks for the question this is
 
03:56:17.809 --> 03:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
offshore wind
 
03:56:20.450 --> 03:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
industry entirely offshore wind we're
 
03:56:23.150 --> 03:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
talking as I said you know 40 50 miles
 
03:56:23.160 --> 03:56:25.070 align:start position:0%
talking as I said you know 40 50 miles
out

03:56:25.070 --> 03:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:56:32.270 --> 03:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:32.280 --> 03:56:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:48.050 --> 03:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
yeah and other trade and other trades
 
03:56:50.030 --> 03:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
too you notice that um that training
 
03:56:54.410 --> 03:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
center is not delimited in terms of what
 
03:56:56.330 --> 03:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
can be done there so if there's the
 
03:56:58.610 --> 03:56:58.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity to train people and that
 
03:56:59.750 --> 03:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
they will be able to work in this
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
industry or go off and work in a similar
 
03:57:04.490 --> 03:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
industry that might be on land or you
 
03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
know might be cabling
 
03:57:12.650 --> 03:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:14.570 --> 03:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Senator
 
03:57:17.809 --> 03:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
um I've read several articles about
 
03:57:17.819 --> 03:57:18.590 align:start position:0%
um I've read several articles about
um

03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:20.510 --> 03:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh I guess it's probably in California
 
03:57:25.809 --> 03:57:25.819 align:start position:0%
where they've had a number of mass
 
03:57:32.050 --> 03:57:32.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:35.769 --> 03:57:35.779 align:start position:0%
fishing and dying and there's some spec
 
03:57:40.490 --> 03:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
excuse me speculation that the testing
 
03:57:43.070 --> 03:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's being done for the sighting of
 
03:57:45.469 --> 03:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
offshore wind
 
03:57:49.150 --> 03:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
um is the cause of some of um those um
 
03:57:52.729 --> 03:57:52.739 align:start position:0%
uh problems uh have in your discussions
 
03:57:56.150 --> 03:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
with um others around the area
 
03:57:57.889 --> 03:57:57.899 align:start position:0%
um have you heard of any discussion
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
along those lines well that's your
 
03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
question and um you know we're getting a
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
little off the bill but let me say it
 
03:58:04.250 --> 03:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
because I am chair of the commission and
 
03:58:06.170 --> 03:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
we have discussed these things and I
 
03:58:07.969 --> 03:58:07.979 align:start position:0%
would say thanks to um assistant
 
03:58:11.150 --> 03:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner Mark Sanborn we have forged
 
03:58:13.070 --> 03:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
a partnership with our fishermen in the
 
03:58:15.769 --> 03:58:15.779 align:start position:0%
state which is unlike any other state
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
um to listen to them and make sure that
 
03:58:19.250 --> 03:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
they're involved and all their concerns
 
03:58:22.309 --> 03:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
are are being addressed we also and I
 
03:58:25.070 --> 03:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
just not entirely aside we passed the
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
bill last year
 
03:58:29.689 --> 03:58:29.699 align:start position:0%
which declared consistency which is a
 
03:58:31.790 --> 03:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
small part of federal government you
 
03:58:33.469 --> 03:58:33.479 align:start position:0%
know we have state waters up to three
 
03:58:36.410 --> 03:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
miles Federal's out of 200. if we take
 
03:58:38.809 --> 03:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
advantage of that federal statute we can
 
03:58:42.229 --> 03:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
declare interests out to 200 miles when
 
03:58:44.689 --> 03:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
it comes to economic and environmental
 
03:58:46.849 --> 03:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
interests so we can protect our our
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
fishermen out there now what you're
 
03:58:51.229 --> 03:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
referring to is some concern about whale
 
03:58:53.570 --> 03:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
death off of New Jersey
 
03:58:55.670 --> 03:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
um there has been if there's been some
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
scientific study that has done shown two
 
03:58:59.870 --> 03:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
things that those whales were most
 
03:59:03.530 --> 03:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
likely killed by strikes from increased
 
03:59:06.950 --> 03:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
um traffic for container ships
 
03:59:09.950 --> 03:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
and then secondly the kinds of concerns
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
about Sonic effects
 
03:59:15.889 --> 03:59:15.899 align:start position:0%
are not done by the offshore wind
 
03:59:17.689 --> 03:59:17.699 align:start position:0%
industry they don't use that kind of
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
that kind of so uh sonar uh that is the
 
03:59:21.479 --> 03:59:22.250 align:start position:0%
that kind of so uh sonar uh that is the
Navy

03:59:22.250 --> 03:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
Navy
 
03:59:25.849 --> 03:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
that's doing that out in deeper waters
 
03:59:25.859 --> 03:59:27.590 align:start position:0%
that's doing that out in deeper waters
and

03:59:27.590 --> 03:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:29.450 --> 03:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
um particularly with our our areas we're
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
not going to be driving piles into the
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
bottom because these are floating
 
03:59:36.410 --> 03:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
and um so and the mapping is being done
 
03:59:38.150 --> 03:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
in a different way so I I know that was
 
03:59:39.650 --> 03:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
out there I read all the Articles and
 
03:59:41.410 --> 03:59:41.420 align:start position:0%
then I've also read the article saying
 
03:59:44.150 --> 03:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh actually probably not related to
 
03:59:45.710 --> 03:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
Offshore wind but you know this is why
 
03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
we do research always has to continue
 
03:59:47.880 --> 03:59:49.429 align:start position:0%
we do research always has to continue
and

03:59:49.429 --> 03:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:51.170 --> 03:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
um you know we're I think we're dealing
 
03:59:53.090 --> 03:59:53.100 align:start position:0%
with that very well in other areas this
 
03:59:55.330 --> 03:59:55.340 align:start position:0%
is about Workforce Development and um
 
04:00:04.809 --> 04:00:04.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:07.070 --> 04:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
you can connect later if you'd like
 
04:00:13.790 --> 04:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh I've got James Anderson
 
04:00:23.050 --> 04:00:23.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:28.010 --> 04:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:29.689 --> 04:00:29.699 align:start position:0%
well good afternoon chairman Ladd
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
04:00:35.830 --> 04:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
I am president and CEO of granite Shore
 
04:00:42.290 --> 04:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
power testifying in support of Senate
 
04:00:44.290 --> 04:00:44.300 align:start position:0%
bill 152.
 
04:00:46.370 --> 04:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
granted Shore power is a wholesale
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
electric generator providing over one
 
04:00:50.330 --> 04:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
gigawatt of seasonal and peaking
 
04:00:53.150 --> 04:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
electric generation from its 11 fuel
 
04:00:54.830 --> 04:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
diverse generating stations located
 
04:00:56.809 --> 04:00:56.819 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire
 
04:00:59.150 --> 04:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
Grand Shore power has operated these
 
04:01:02.030 --> 04:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
facilities since its acquisition of the
 
04:01:03.710 --> 04:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
assets from Public Service Company of
 
04:01:06.110 --> 04:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in 2018
 
04:01:09.410 --> 04:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
following the state mandated divestiture
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
from our earliest days gsp's message has
 
04:01:14.870 --> 04:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
been consistent and clear
 
04:01:17.210 --> 04:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
Granite sure power can be dependent on
 
04:01:20.269 --> 04:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
whether on our coldest nights or hottest
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
days and we strongly support a
 
04:01:24.830 --> 04:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
transition to the next generation of
 
04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
energy resources in New Hampshire
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
we encourage a constructive dialogue
 
04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
about how best to achieve our shared
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
decarbonization goals and advancing a
 
04:01:36.650 --> 04:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
renewable and reliable energy
 
04:01:38.689 --> 04:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for the New England
 
04:01:38.699 --> 04:01:40.010 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for the New England
region

04:01:40.010 --> 04:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
region
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and other renewable
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
generation are rapidly becoming a
 
04:01:47.990 --> 04:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
realistic opportunity as policy and
 
04:01:50.330 --> 04:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
resources are better aligned
 
04:01:52.729 --> 04:01:52.739 align:start position:0%
we know there is approximately 35
 
04:01:55.550 --> 04:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
gigawatts of offshore wind projects
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
either announced or in development
 
04:02:02.630 --> 04:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
spanning from North Carolina to Maine
 
04:02:04.490 --> 04:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
we are encouraged by the prospects of
 
04:02:06.670 --> 04:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
projects located in the Gulf of Maine
 
04:02:09.110 --> 04:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
once the U.S department of Interiors
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
Bureau of ocean and energy management
 
04:02:14.809 --> 04:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
completes its leasing process
 
04:02:16.910 --> 04:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
the offshore wind and other renewable
 
04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
generation sectors require a
 
04:02:22.729 --> 04:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
well-trained professional Workforce if
 
04:02:25.010 --> 04:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is going to benefit from
 
04:02:27.490 --> 04:02:27.500 align:start position:0%
energy transition and renewable energy
 
04:02:30.830 --> 04:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities not only decarbonization
 
04:02:33.889 --> 04:02:33.899 align:start position:0%
efforts but also the economic growth it
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
is imperative that the state encourage
 
04:02:38.150 --> 04:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce training and support
 
04:02:40.130 --> 04:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
investment in a Workforce Training
 
04:02:42.590 --> 04:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
Center convenient to the port facilities
 
04:02:44.330 --> 04:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth
 
04:02:46.610 --> 04:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is well suited to take
 
04:02:48.889 --> 04:02:48.899 align:start position:0%
advantage of its highly qualified trade
 
04:02:50.750 --> 04:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
professionals and educational
 
04:02:53.090 --> 04:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
institutions to compete for the
 
04:02:55.550 --> 04:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
businesses that will support projects
 
04:02:58.189 --> 04:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
necessary to transition the region to
 
04:03:00.290 --> 04:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
the next generation of energy resources
 
04:03:03.410 --> 04:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
and Drive New Hampshire Commerce
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
Granite Shore power has a strong
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
relationship with the IBEW and employs
 
04:03:10.670 --> 04:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
many of its professionals who are
 
04:03:14.090 --> 04:03:14.100 align:start position:0%
electricians mechanics operators and
 
04:03:17.389 --> 04:03:17.399 align:start position:0%
instrument and control technicians
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
we commend the sponsor and co-sponsor
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
for putting SB 152 forward and we
 
04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
strongly support it
 
04:03:26.330 --> 04:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
this bill will help New Hampshire lead
 
04:03:28.729 --> 04:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
the way enabling energy and
 
04:03:30.950 --> 04:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects that are truly
 
04:03:30.960 --> 04:03:32.269 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects that are truly
transformative

04:03:32.269 --> 04:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
transformative
 
04:03:35.090 --> 04:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
moreover establishing a Workforce
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
Training Center committee that actively
 
04:03:39.410 --> 04:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
engages the private sector and will
 
04:03:41.389 --> 04:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
recommend sound policies is the right
 
04:03:42.769 --> 04:03:42.779 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
04:03:45.010 --> 04:03:45.020 align:start position:0%
that committee will consider training
 
04:03:48.290 --> 04:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
facilities and partners that will enable
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
critical Workforce Development and
 
04:03:52.130 --> 04:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
create long-term employment
 
04:03:54.590 --> 04:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities in close proximity to
 
04:03:55.969 --> 04:03:55.979 align:start position:0%
these projects
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
it is critical that this work begin now
 
04:04:01.309 --> 04:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
so we are not disadvantaged by other
 
04:04:03.650 --> 04:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
states taking the lead New Hampshire
 
04:04:05.929 --> 04:04:05.939 align:start position:0%
should lead in this area and this bill
 
04:04:08.210 --> 04:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
will help do just that
 
04:04:09.830 --> 04:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to share
 
04:04:11.809 --> 04:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
My Views and I'll be happy to take any
 
04:04:11.819 --> 04:04:16.370 align:start position:0%
My Views and I'll be happy to take any
questions

04:04:16.370 --> 04:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:19.729 --> 04:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
in the CTE programs we have now
 
04:04:23.090 --> 04:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
in another area of inviting business to
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
help us out we have the New Hampshire
 
04:04:27.250 --> 04:04:27.260 align:start position:0%
Automobile Dealers Association
 
04:04:31.849 --> 04:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
bringing Toyota forward GM Etc standards
 
04:04:34.370 --> 04:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
and personnel and dollars to help us
 
04:04:38.450 --> 04:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
with CPE is your area of the business
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
willing to do the same
 
04:04:42.590 --> 04:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
we are I mean I'm here advocating for
 
04:04:46.849 --> 04:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
the IBEW members that I employ and their
 
04:04:48.530 --> 04:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
professional trades that they represent
 
04:04:51.530 --> 04:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
I believe those are critical jobs to New
 
04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and to our country frankly and
 
04:04:55.670 --> 04:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
I think there's tremendous growth
 
04:04:58.070 --> 04:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity in the renewable sector not
 
04:05:00.650 --> 04:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
just the offshore wind projects but also
 
04:05:02.450 --> 04:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
other renewable projects and I think New
 
04:05:03.650 --> 04:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs to be a leader in
 
04:05:05.809 --> 04:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
training those professionals to to lead
 
04:05:08.330 --> 04:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:05:22.969 --> 04:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:24.830 --> 04:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon members of committee
 
04:05:26.750 --> 04:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh chairman lad nice to see you uh
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
Associated builders and contractors we
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
will present uh about 270 employers here
 
04:05:32.809 --> 04:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that are primarily uh
 
04:05:34.849 --> 04:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial and heavy
 
04:05:36.530 --> 04:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
construction contractors throughout the
 
04:05:38.990 --> 04:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
state and uh for me more of I thought
 
04:05:40.490 --> 04:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'd be here just as sort of a resource
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
let you all know if you have questions
 
04:05:43.729 --> 04:05:43.739 align:start position:0%
about how apprenticeship things like
 
04:05:45.290 --> 04:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
that function just in general we feel
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill makes some good strides we
 
04:05:49.130 --> 04:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
are supportive of the bill because we
 
04:05:51.410 --> 04:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
feel like offshore wind development is
 
04:05:52.910 --> 04:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
something that's long overdue here in
 
04:05:54.650 --> 04:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
the region
 
04:05:56.990 --> 04:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
um just generally speaking the structure
 
04:05:58.250 --> 04:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
of the bill seems to work pretty well
 
04:06:01.010 --> 04:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
for it it is uh got a good
 
04:06:02.689 --> 04:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
representation across the board from
 
04:06:04.250 --> 04:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
some of the different constituencies
 
04:06:05.809 --> 04:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
that will be affected um it doesn't
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily have specifically a
 
04:06:08.929 --> 04:06:08.939 align:start position:0%
contractor representative on the
 
04:06:10.250 --> 04:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
commission but we fill within the
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
current structure we'd be able to work
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
with uh the commission to develop a good
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
training program the ABC is one that is
 
04:06:17.570 --> 04:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
actually helped create apprenticeship
 
04:06:19.130 --> 04:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
programs across the country and right
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire as well we help a
 
04:06:22.370 --> 04:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
lot of contractors to develop their
 
04:06:24.290 --> 04:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
Workforce which is important for us
 
04:06:25.849 --> 04:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
because we feel bills like this will
 
04:06:27.650 --> 04:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
help address some of the shortages we
 
04:06:29.570 --> 04:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
have in the workforce issues that we're
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
facing to give an example the average
 
04:06:32.809 --> 04:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
age of a craft worker in the states
 
04:06:34.990 --> 04:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
about 55 years young
 
04:06:38.150 --> 04:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
and uh you know it we talk about a
 
04:06:39.290 --> 04:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
little bit but it's it's becoming an
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
issue where today we don't have enough
 
04:06:43.309 --> 04:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
people coming in through the trades uh
 
04:06:45.290 --> 04:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
for for merit that is open shop or Union
 
04:06:47.150 --> 04:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
and we feel at the end of the day that
 
04:06:48.410 --> 04:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
the more we can do to help promote some
 
04:06:50.090 --> 04:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
of those trainings through the CTE
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
centers and helping the pipeline in
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
through employers that have their own
 
04:06:54.650 --> 04:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
independent apprenticeship programs as
 
04:06:57.170 --> 04:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
well it certainly be welcome so as this
 
04:06:58.670 --> 04:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
moves forward we encourage the support
 
04:07:00.889 --> 04:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
of the bill and we hope to be a partner
 
04:07:03.469 --> 04:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
to help develop what the bill sets
 
04:07:05.689 --> 04:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
forward to do so with that have you take
 
04:07:07.550 --> 04:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
any questions if anyone has any um
 
04:07:08.929 --> 04:07:08.939 align:start position:0%
otherwise thank you for letting me speak
 
04:07:12.130 --> 04:07:12.140 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
04:07:29.040 --> 04:07:29.990 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
committee

04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:07:31.790 --> 04:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Rob Warner I'm the state
 
04:07:32.990 --> 04:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
director here in New Hampshire for the
 
04:07:34.969 --> 04:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
leak of conservation voters
 
04:07:38.809 --> 04:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
I also and the New Hampshire lead for a
 
04:07:40.370 --> 04:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
coalition throughout the region called
 
04:07:42.889 --> 04:07:42.899 align:start position:0%
New England for offshore wind
 
04:07:44.750 --> 04:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
so I want to Echo a lot of what other
 
04:07:46.610 --> 04:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
speakers have said in terms of the
 
04:07:46.620 --> 04:07:47.830 align:start position:0%
speakers have said in terms of the
opportunity

04:07:47.830 --> 04:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
but I think that
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
this opportunity is going to create
 
04:07:54.479 --> 04:07:57.189 align:start position:0%
this opportunity is going to create
tremendous

04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
04:08:00.229 --> 04:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
situations for many workers across the
 
04:08:02.150 --> 04:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
region not only New Hampshire
 
04:08:06.010 --> 04:08:06.020 align:start position:0%
to create very well-paying jobs
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that we are taking
 
04:08:12.650 --> 04:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
advantage of this industry as I've been
 
04:08:14.050 --> 04:08:14.060 align:start position:0%
stated previously
 
04:08:16.490 --> 04:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
there are billions of dollars that are
 
04:08:18.170 --> 04:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
going to be invested and are already
 
04:08:20.809 --> 04:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
being invested this industry is well
 
04:08:23.570 --> 04:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
underway throughout the east coast and
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts for example The
 
04:08:27.229 --> 04:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
Vineyard wind project is already laying
 
04:08:30.889 --> 04:08:30.899 align:start position:0%
cable to be connected to Barnstable so
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
there are active projects going on right
 
04:08:33.359 --> 04:08:34.450 align:start position:0%
there are active projects going on right
now

04:08:34.450 --> 04:08:34.460 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:08:37.250 --> 04:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
our group of League conservation voters
 
04:08:38.929 --> 04:08:38.939 align:start position:0%
and New England Frost our wind feels
 
04:08:41.150 --> 04:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
very strongly that New Hampshire must
 
04:08:43.849 --> 04:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
position itself to take best advantage
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
of this opportunity it means a lot of
 
04:08:47.990 --> 04:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
economic development for our communities
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
it means Economic Opportunity for our
 
04:08:53.150 --> 04:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
workers and it is a very long-term
 
04:08:56.450 --> 04:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
proposition in terms of the Investments
 
04:08:57.769 --> 04:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
that are going to be made so are you
 
04:09:01.010 --> 04:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
talking about welders electricians are
 
04:09:02.170 --> 04:09:02.180 align:start position:0%
you talking about
 
04:09:04.130 --> 04:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
administrators talking about project
 
04:09:07.210 --> 04:09:07.220 align:start position:0%
managers it's really a wide range of
 
04:09:09.349 --> 04:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity and jobs that will be
 
04:09:13.130 --> 04:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
created throughout the region and and in
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
this state because of the Investments
 
04:09:17.929 --> 04:09:17.939 align:start position:0%
that are being made and will be made so
 
04:09:20.030 --> 04:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
we will feel very strongly that this is
 
04:09:21.729 --> 04:09:21.739 align:start position:0%
a investment
 
04:09:25.010 --> 04:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
in Education and Training that is
 
04:09:28.010 --> 04:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
essential for New Hampshire and the
 
04:09:30.410 --> 04:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
future of our people and grew up
 
04:09:33.410 --> 04:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
providing opportunity for our citizens
 
04:09:35.809 --> 04:09:35.819 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Marine trades Association
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
we're here in support of Senate bill
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
152. I did submit testimony through
 
04:10:34.610 --> 04:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
email but I have copies here as well if
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
anybody needs one I'll start with a
 
04:10:37.550 --> 04:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
general statement and I'm going to turn
 
04:10:39.290 --> 04:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
it over to the expert to uh to continue
 
04:10:41.389 --> 04:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:10:43.729 --> 04:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
so for the record we support this spill
 
04:10:45.530 --> 04:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly we're specifically
 
04:10:47.150 --> 04:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
speaking to section one of the bill
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
which creates the Marine trades pathway
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
so it's uh page one lines one through
 
04:10:54.410 --> 04:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
six we're going to focus our testimony
 
04:10:55.729 --> 04:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
just really right there because it's
 
04:10:57.950 --> 04:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
about the Marine trades
 
04:10:59.809 --> 04:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
um we would have had more marinas here
 
04:11:01.309 --> 04:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
today to support and show the commitment
 
04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the industry toward this program but
 
04:11:05.030 --> 04:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
today actually is the annual education
 
04:11:08.210 --> 04:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
day fundamental so I have a picture of
 
04:11:11.090 --> 04:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
about 70 Marina operators owners and
 
04:11:13.250 --> 04:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
employees that have their thumbs up to
 
04:11:14.689 --> 04:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
show you how supportive they are of this
 
04:11:16.189 --> 04:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill I apologize that they couldn't be
 
04:11:17.809 --> 04:11:17.819 align:start position:0%
here today
 
04:11:20.150 --> 04:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
um recreational boating is about a one
 
04:11:22.969 --> 04:11:22.979 align:start position:0%
two one point two billion dollar annual
 
04:11:25.550 --> 04:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
economic impact in New Hampshire and
 
04:11:28.250 --> 04:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
those are 2018 numbers as many of you
 
04:11:30.290 --> 04:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
might know during the pandemic a lot of
 
04:11:32.630 --> 04:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
people turn to the water to get out and
 
04:11:34.370 --> 04:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
get out with their families so we're
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
expecting the 2023 numbers to come in
 
04:11:39.469 --> 04:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
probably higher than that we have a lot
 
04:11:41.389 --> 04:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire marine-based businesses
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
that belong to the association
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
both in the Seacoast as well as in The
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region and there are lakes all
 
04:11:49.250 --> 04:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
around our state so we're finding a
 
04:11:51.469 --> 04:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
challenge with Workforce we're trying to
 
04:11:53.450 --> 04:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
try to um work together and we're very
 
04:11:56.150 --> 04:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
appreciative of sponsor Senator Waters
 
04:11:57.650 --> 04:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
and representative Cordelia and all the
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
other sponsors who have seen this as a
 
04:12:02.510 --> 04:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
need in our community so I will turn it
 
04:12:05.809 --> 04:12:05.819 align:start position:0%
to Jeremiah who is the Oxford
 
04:12:08.570 --> 04:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thanks for for hearing us
 
04:12:08.580 --> 04:12:09.950 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thanks for for hearing us
today

04:12:09.950 --> 04:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:12:12.650 --> 04:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
um I grew up in in The Lakes Region and
 
04:12:15.950 --> 04:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh love what New Hampshire has to offer
 
04:12:18.769 --> 04:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
and boating is one of those things that
 
04:12:20.809 --> 04:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
brings families together it brings
 
04:12:25.490 --> 04:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
people together and uh is is one of the
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
things that attracts a lot of tourists
 
04:12:31.010 --> 04:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
to our area in The Lakes Region when I
 
04:12:33.830 --> 04:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
became general manager of Goodhue
 
04:12:33.840 --> 04:12:34.790 align:start position:0%
became general manager of Goodhue
um

04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh looking towards Workforce and needing
 
04:12:40.689 --> 04:12:40.699 align:start position:0%
to to sustain our growing business
 
04:12:43.309 --> 04:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
there weren't really places to go to
 
04:12:46.010 --> 04:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
find uh development so I started
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
reaching out to Lakes Region Technology
 
04:12:52.130 --> 04:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
Center right there in Wolfeboro for in
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with them uh invited field
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
trips to come out go to their career
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
days we're seeing students now with good
 
04:13:03.050 --> 04:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
few t-shirts and sweatshirts that didn't
 
04:13:07.330 --> 04:13:07.340 align:start position:0%
even work at Goodhue wearing these these
 
04:13:11.710 --> 04:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
apparel and creating a buzz around
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
marinas and the industry and a lot of
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
times these students don't even realize
 
04:13:20.410 --> 04:13:20.420 align:start position:0%
that there are careers in Marina
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
specifically there's currently not a
 
04:13:25.250 --> 04:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
program at the Lakes Region Technology
 
04:13:27.969 --> 04:13:27.979 align:start position:0%
Center for marine
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
as I going through the search trying to
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
find where do we attract people and and
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
just you know know workers no other
 
04:13:39.530 --> 04:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
program that I could find in New
 
04:13:39.540 --> 04:13:40.929 align:start position:0%
program that I could find in New
Hampshire

04:13:40.929 --> 04:13:40.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:13:43.570 --> 04:13:43.580 align:start position:0%
at the CT level
 
04:13:46.269 --> 04:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
existed that I know of
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
there is at the community college a
 
04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
program which is a phenomenal program
 
04:13:56.210 --> 04:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
and we we actually use that program to
 
04:13:58.070 --> 04:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
train technicians and continue their
 
04:14:01.630 --> 04:14:01.640 align:start position:0%
education and send them to school there
 
04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
but I had to actually go to Maine to
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
find a CTE program
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
at that level
 
04:14:11.809 --> 04:14:11.819 align:start position:0%
had an Enlightenment there that the
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
actual curriculum exists already for
 
04:14:18.530 --> 04:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
this type of program American boating
 
04:14:21.349 --> 04:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
and Yacht council is a very well-known
 
04:14:23.630 --> 04:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
accreditation and program within the
 
04:14:26.090 --> 04:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
marina industry they have the textbooks
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
they have workbooks they have all of the
 
04:14:32.210 --> 04:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
curriculum necessary to plug in and play
 
04:14:38.210 --> 04:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
into our schools here in New Hampshire
 
04:14:41.809 --> 04:14:41.819 align:start position:0%
um so certainly as far as timing to kind
 
04:14:43.729 --> 04:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
of answer your question on if it's the
 
04:14:47.090 --> 04:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
CTE programs in timing I feel that when
 
04:14:49.309 --> 04:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
working with Lakes Region Technology
 
04:14:51.290 --> 04:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
Center this could happen really quickly
 
04:14:54.170 --> 04:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
the curriculums there the the program
 
04:14:56.750 --> 04:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
the the principal and the school is
 
04:14:58.610 --> 04:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
willing and our Partnerships with the
 
04:15:00.610 --> 04:15:00.620 align:start position:0%
Marine trades Association we're ready to
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
help facilitate how we can
 
04:15:06.650 --> 04:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
um which will also feed that Community
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
College level as well so I'm very
 
04:15:13.309 --> 04:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
excited I started on this road probably
 
04:15:15.889 --> 04:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
three or four years ago I feel like Cove
 
04:15:18.349 --> 04:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
had kind of derailed it a little bit but
 
04:15:21.290 --> 04:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
excited just to see it back moving
 
04:15:23.929 --> 04:15:23.939 align:start position:0%
forward now if we can take any questions
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
if if you have any
 
04:15:27.170 --> 04:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
04:15:27.180 --> 04:15:29.929 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

04:15:29.929 --> 04:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
not seeing thank you very much have a
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:37.849 --> 04:15:37.859 align:start position:0%
I don't have any other cards up here for
 
04:15:39.950 --> 04:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:15:42.170 --> 04:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
um is anybody else out there
 
04:15:48.410 --> 04:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:52.490 --> 04:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
you said Cornell wants director
 
04:15:54.490 --> 04:15:54.500 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
04:16:03.600 --> 04:16:04.610 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
committee

04:16:04.610 --> 04:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:16:06.170 --> 04:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
um I'll just open it up to uh two
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions I'm happy to answer any 10
 
04:16:09.170 --> 04:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
questions anyone may have you better
 
04:16:13.130 --> 04:16:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you how soon do you think the
 
04:16:17.210 --> 04:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
program could be up and running in
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
whichever location is best for for this
 
04:16:22.490 --> 04:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
program but it would be very quick the
 
04:16:24.410 --> 04:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
the way this would work is rather than
 
04:16:26.150 --> 04:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
bringing a separate and distinct Marine
 
04:16:28.189 --> 04:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
trades program we would treat it as a
 
04:16:30.889 --> 04:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
pathway uh course or a Capstone within
 
04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
an existing program there's a number of
 
04:16:35.210 --> 04:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
programs that would be good fits uh so
 
04:16:37.969 --> 04:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
if we're thinking about Hull repair for
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
example auto body is going to be a
 
04:16:41.510 --> 04:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
natural fit where students that are
 
04:16:42.590 --> 04:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
going through the auto body program
 
04:16:44.450 --> 04:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
would then take a Capstone or additional
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
course that would then be specific to
 
04:16:48.189 --> 04:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
hole repair
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
we would develop a set of competencies
 
04:16:52.689 --> 04:16:52.699 align:start position:0%
that are unique to Marine trades
 
04:16:55.250 --> 04:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
the things that a student would need to
 
04:16:57.050 --> 04:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
know and be able to do in order to work
 
04:16:59.150 --> 04:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
in a field that's related to something
 
04:17:00.769 --> 04:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
we've already studied so I think some of
 
04:17:02.570 --> 04:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
the natural fits would be auto body
 
04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
repair technology Auto Body rather Auto
 
04:17:08.769 --> 04:17:08.779 align:start position:0%
technology for the the engine part of it
 
04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
diesel equipment but also there's some
 
04:17:13.729 --> 04:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
other interesting opportunity is an area
 
04:17:17.150 --> 04:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
of welding welding soldering and I think
 
04:17:18.889 --> 04:17:18.899 align:start position:0%
those can be brought on very quickly the
 
04:17:20.090 --> 04:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
there's a question earlier about
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
industry recognized credentials and that
 
04:17:25.389 --> 04:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
dual certification of welding
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
certification and Diving would be a
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
great fit a number of our CTE programs
 
04:17:33.410 --> 04:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
have Municipal pools that are right
 
04:17:35.570 --> 04:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
close by Dover and Portsmouth will
 
04:17:37.370 --> 04:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
spring to mind so young person could be
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
scuba certified and do a welding program
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
at the same CT Center come out with two
 
04:17:43.199 --> 04:17:45.290 align:start position:0%
at the same CT Center come out with two
certifications

04:17:45.290 --> 04:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
certifications
 
04:17:46.429 --> 04:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden thank you thank
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
you for coming to the table you made me
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
think of a question I think this is a
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
great Bell I love to see expansion of
 
04:17:58.010 --> 04:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
ctes and pathways
 
04:17:59.929 --> 04:17:59.939 align:start position:0%
but from an administrative perspective
 
04:18:01.849 --> 04:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
does that mean the school district needs
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
to seek out in an additional
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
Personnel to be able to from the field
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide that program or
 
04:18:13.309 --> 04:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
would it be integrated within whatever
 
04:18:15.889 --> 04:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
programs the school has already
 
04:18:16.849 --> 04:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden um the answer is
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
is the latter the the existing program
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
would have these additional competencies
 
04:18:25.849 --> 04:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
every CTE program has a program advisory
 
04:18:27.950 --> 04:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee one of our requirements is
 
04:18:29.689 --> 04:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
work-based learning so taking part in
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
either authentic or simulated uh work
 
04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
that includes sustained interaction with
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
industry professionals so some of that
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
direct instruction that's specific to
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
the Marine trades could be provided by
 
04:18:44.330 --> 04:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
the supervision could be provided by
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
that program advisory committee member
 
04:18:48.170 --> 04:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
coming in and doing their time taking
 
04:18:50.410 --> 04:18:50.420 align:start position:0%
advantage of the tax credit
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
and the the district would not need to
 
04:18:56.870 --> 04:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
hire any additional Advanced endorse
 
04:18:59.809 --> 04:18:59.819 align:start position:0%
endorsements of certified personnel
 
04:19:02.030 --> 04:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:19:03.769 --> 04:19:03.779 align:start position:0%
I'm on track with you instead of
 
04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
increasing that budget by 2 million to
 
04:19:07.849 --> 04:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
11 million per year of the biennium
 
04:19:10.969 --> 04:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to increase it to
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to grow
 
04:19:15.229 --> 04:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:19:20.150 --> 04:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
my question how much capacity do the
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
existing programs have for instance when
 
04:19:24.830 --> 04:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
you referenced the overlap with the auto
 
04:19:27.530 --> 04:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
body can you accommodate a lot more
 
04:19:29.929 --> 04:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
students that's a great question and I
 
04:19:31.309 --> 04:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
think the way that it will work out is
 
04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
it probably won't be an influx of
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
additional students to begin with I
 
04:19:36.170 --> 04:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
think once these these path leads are
 
04:19:38.210 --> 04:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
established that may attract more
 
04:19:40.010 --> 04:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
students that have an interest I think
 
04:19:41.870 --> 04:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
the way it will work in the present time
 
04:19:44.570 --> 04:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
is already we've we've opened up um
 
04:19:47.389 --> 04:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
thank you to to this body
 
04:19:49.849 --> 04:19:49.859 align:start position:0%
um CTE is now open to students that have
 
04:19:51.469 --> 04:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
completed one year of high school so
 
04:19:53.689 --> 04:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
whereas in the past CT was often junior
 
04:19:55.729 --> 04:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
year senior year now it's sophomore year
 
04:19:57.650 --> 04:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
junior year senior year so there's an
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity that opens up for a young
 
04:20:02.330 --> 04:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
person who goes into a program in the
 
04:20:04.010 --> 04:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
sophomore year to go through say let's
 
04:20:05.450 --> 04:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
say for the sake of argument Auto Tech
 
04:20:08.210 --> 04:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
you learn how to work on cars in 10th
 
04:20:10.010 --> 04:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
Grade 11th grade they decide they want
 
04:20:12.889 --> 04:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
to focus on marine tech in senior year
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
which could include some work-based
 
04:20:17.150 --> 04:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
learning um component or some study it
 
04:20:19.309 --> 04:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
at the local community college so I
 
04:20:21.530 --> 04:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
think that that the capacity building
 
04:20:24.110 --> 04:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
potential is there and I think that we
 
04:20:26.210 --> 04:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
could turn the lights on on a pathway of

okay

04:21:49.929 --> 04:21:49.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:52.130 --> 04:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
Sarah Carson you always been here before
 
04:21:54.889 --> 04:21:54.899 align:start position:0%

Affairs or
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I spent eight years in this
 
04:22:01.610 --> 04:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
room as a House member so yeah I'm very
 
04:22:03.769 --> 04:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
familiar not with this layout but when
 
04:22:05.750 --> 04:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
the room was much smaller but it is a
 
04:22:07.790 --> 04:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be back here
 
04:22:09.889 --> 04:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
um in House Education
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much and you're
 
04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
welcome to have the floor thank you Mr
 
04:22:17.870 --> 04:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh good afternoon honorable
 
04:22:19.969 --> 04:22:19.979 align:start position:0%
members of the House Education committee
 
04:22:22.370 --> 04:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Sharon Carson
 
04:22:24.349 --> 04:22:24.359 align:start position:0%
and I have the pleasure of representing
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
Senate District 14 comprising the towns
 
04:22:30.050 --> 04:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
of Londonderry Hudson and Auburn and I
 
04:22:31.490 --> 04:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
have for your consideration this
 
04:22:34.429 --> 04:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon Senate Bill 16 which seeks to
 
04:22:36.290 --> 04:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
make changes to the requirements for the
 
04:22:40.130 --> 04:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
Civics for civics education in school Mr
 
04:22:41.809 --> 04:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
chairman as you are well aware because
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
you were here we have passed a Civics
 
04:22:48.290 --> 04:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
requirement for our children in schools
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
that they must have before they graduate
 
04:22:52.729 --> 04:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately we really didn't flush
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
it out too much and so what this bill
 
04:22:59.090 --> 04:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
tries to do is set up those parameters
 
04:23:01.490 --> 04:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
um so everyone is on the same page when
 
04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
it comes to our students getting a
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
Civics education in our Public School
 
04:23:06.960 --> 04:23:08.689 align:start position:0%
Civics education in our Public School
System

04:23:08.689 --> 04:23:08.699 align:start position:0%
System
 
04:23:12.050 --> 04:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 216 was written by uh was
 
04:23:14.090 --> 04:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
written to establish a Civics education
 
04:23:17.150 --> 04:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
commission as well
 
04:23:19.490 --> 04:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
um Civics is quite frankly more than
 
04:23:21.769 --> 04:23:21.779 align:start position:0%
learning about government Civics
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
encompasses how government works in
 
04:23:27.769 --> 04:23:27.779 align:start position:0%
action and quite frankly Mr chairman I
 
04:23:29.330 --> 04:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
don't know most people are aware of this
 
04:23:31.250 --> 04:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
but I teach classes in government in
 
04:23:34.429 --> 04:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
politics at a community college in our
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
state so I see a lot of the students
 
04:23:38.929 --> 04:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
when they come out of public our Public
 
04:23:42.530 --> 04:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
School Systems some of them have a
 
04:23:44.450 --> 04:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
little bit of knowledge but the vast
 
04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
majority of them just really do not
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
understand how our government works and
 
04:23:53.210 --> 04:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
more importantly how they can access
 
04:23:55.969 --> 04:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
government and I tell my students it's
 
04:23:58.189 --> 04:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
important that you realize government
 
04:24:00.889 --> 04:24:00.899 align:start position:0%
determines how we live our lives every
 
04:24:03.769 --> 04:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
day it tells us what you can do and it
 
04:24:06.650 --> 04:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
tells you what you can't do and so how
 
04:24:08.389 --> 04:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
can you participate
 
04:24:11.150 --> 04:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
if you don't understand it if you don't
 
04:24:13.969 --> 04:24:13.979 align:start position:0%
know how you can make government work
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
for you and how you can let your voice
 
04:24:18.590 --> 04:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
be heard
 
04:24:22.429 --> 04:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I went to public school a
 
04:24:24.830 --> 04:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
very long time ago I'm not afraid to say
 
04:24:28.849 --> 04:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
that and we were taught Civics we were
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
taught Civics beginning in Grammar
 
04:24:30.960 --> 04:24:31.969 align:start position:0%
taught Civics beginning in Grammar
School

04:24:31.969 --> 04:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
School
 
04:24:35.450 --> 04:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
and for some reason and somehow it just
 
04:24:37.790 --> 04:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
seemed to kind of drop off the face of
 
04:24:41.389 --> 04:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
the map for a while but I think today it
 
04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
is more important than ever that our
 
04:24:47.090 --> 04:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
children learn about our system of
 
04:24:50.450 --> 04:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
government and how it actually works so
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
they again can access it and be a part
 
04:24:58.849 --> 04:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:58.859 --> 04:25:00.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:03.469 --> 04:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
we I firmly believe that the education
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
of all of our citizens is critical for
 
04:25:08.689 --> 04:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
the development and advancement not only
 
04:25:10.849 --> 04:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
of our state but of our country as well
 
04:25:13.969 --> 04:25:13.979 align:start position:0%
and they must be equipped with knowledge
 
04:25:17.090 --> 04:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
so they can stand up
 
04:25:19.250 --> 04:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
and fight for what they believe is best
 
04:25:22.130 --> 04:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
for our country and for our state
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
this is civics is a non-partisan subject
 
04:25:27.170 --> 04:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
there's no you'll see there's no mention
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
of parties in there anywhere
 
04:25:32.990 --> 04:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
this is truly about educating our
 
04:25:35.210 --> 04:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
children so they can become good
 
04:25:37.610 --> 04:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
citizens and knowing how to access our
 
04:25:37.620 --> 04:25:39.229 align:start position:0%
citizens and knowing how to access our
systems

04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
systems
 
04:25:40.969 --> 04:25:40.979 align:start position:0%
um it's important that students
 
04:25:43.490 --> 04:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
understand that we have a two-party
 
04:25:46.849 --> 04:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
system and why we have a two-party
 
04:25:49.910 --> 04:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
system and how it has evolved over time
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
because if any of you have been a
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
political science students you know that
 
04:25:59.210 --> 04:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
it's it's not straightforward it kind of
 
04:26:01.010 --> 04:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
goes back and forth and around and
 
04:26:03.170 --> 04:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
around and what was once a republican is
 
04:26:05.330 --> 04:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
now a Democrat and what is now a
 
04:26:07.370 --> 04:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
Democrat was once a republican in fact
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
there was once a party called the
 
04:26:11.269 --> 04:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
Democrat Republicans
 
04:26:13.550 --> 04:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
um and it helps to put that into context
 
04:26:16.250 --> 04:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
when you're teaching Civics to children
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
to understand the background of the
 
04:26:21.410 --> 04:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
evolution of our political system and
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
our and our government what it also
 
04:26:27.110 --> 04:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
wants to do is really have students
 
04:26:30.050 --> 04:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
develop critical thinking skills when it
 
04:26:31.969 --> 04:26:31.979 align:start position:0%
comes to government to think
 
04:26:35.269 --> 04:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
independently for yourself because when
 
04:26:37.010 --> 04:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
you go in that voting booth whether
 
04:26:39.050 --> 04:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
you're voting on a warrant article at
 
04:26:41.469 --> 04:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
the local level with spending of money
 
04:26:45.410 --> 04:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
or you're voting for candidates you want
 
04:26:47.809 --> 04:26:47.819 align:start position:0%
to make what I tell my students is an
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
educated decision
 
04:26:51.769 --> 04:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
how do you make that kind of a decision
 
04:26:55.610 --> 04:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
well you look into the candidate you
 
04:26:57.290 --> 04:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
meet the candidate and quite frankly
 
04:26:59.689 --> 04:26:59.699 align:start position:0%
that's one of the great things about New
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that every two years you've
 
04:27:05.389 --> 04:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
got a whole bunch of people that are
 
04:27:08.269 --> 04:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
running for office and quick there were
 
04:27:09.889 --> 04:27:09.899 align:start position:0%
a lot of kids and young students that
 
04:27:12.889 --> 04:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
are afraid to approach a candidate
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
and so I asked them I said look it's
 
04:27:17.870 --> 04:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
somebody who's running for office in
 
04:27:20.149 --> 04:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
your District reach out to them send
 
04:27:23.210 --> 04:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
them an email ask them questions if they
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
don't respond to you that's an
 
04:27:27.410 --> 04:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
indication right there
 
04:27:30.170 --> 04:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
but it's important that they have those
 
04:27:32.689 --> 04:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
critical thinking skills so they can
 
04:27:35.450 --> 04:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
make those decisions and if we don't
 
04:27:37.790 --> 04:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
give them the basic knowledge of our
 
04:27:40.670 --> 04:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
government and how it works how are they
 
04:27:43.189 --> 04:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
going to be able to make those kinds of
 
04:27:44.689 --> 04:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
decisions if they don't even know where
 
04:27:45.649 --> 04:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
to start
 
04:27:48.229 --> 04:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
I tell students that they ask well how
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
can I get involved and I said well
 
04:27:53.570 --> 04:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's up to you sometimes it's just as
 
04:27:55.849 --> 04:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
easy as putting a lot a sign on your
 
04:27:59.210 --> 04:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
front lawn or a bumper sticker on your
 
04:28:01.429 --> 04:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
car letting people know that you support
 
04:28:03.290 --> 04:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
a particular candidate you believe
 
04:28:05.510 --> 04:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
strongly in that account in that
 
04:28:07.849 --> 04:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
candidate or you can write a letter to
 
04:28:10.250 --> 04:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
the editor of your local paper in
 
04:28:12.969 --> 04:28:12.979 align:start position:0%
support of a candidate or go to an event
 
04:28:16.610 --> 04:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
and a lot of students don't I didn't
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
know I could do that but I think if they
 
04:28:22.849 --> 04:28:22.859 align:start position:0%
had this grounding in Civics they would
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
understand that our system works based
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
on participation
 
04:28:30.410 --> 04:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
that our forefathers created our
 
04:28:33.710 --> 04:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
government for them to participate we
 
04:28:36.649 --> 04:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
tend to forget Mr chair that we started
 
04:28:40.370 --> 04:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
out as a colony and we think of colonies
 
04:28:42.170 --> 04:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
and Colonial and people were dressed in
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
nice little big dresses and the
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
gentlemen were wearing hoes and fancy
 
04:28:46.439 --> 04:28:47.389 align:start position:0%
gentlemen were wearing hoes and fancy
suits

04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
suits
 
04:28:49.610 --> 04:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
but we did not have the ability to
 
04:28:51.530 --> 04:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
govern ourselves
 
04:28:54.349 --> 04:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
we had Colonial legislatures which over
 
04:28:57.170 --> 04:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
time became more powerful than I think
 
04:29:01.309 --> 04:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
what England had intended them to be but
 
04:29:04.670 --> 04:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
that be that at his may they were
 
04:29:07.370 --> 04:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
hamstringed they had no representation
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
in Congress I mean in Parliament
 
04:29:13.130 --> 04:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
whatsoever nothing but most students
 
04:29:15.649 --> 04:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
aren't taught that type of History just
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
so you know my degrees are in history
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
and early American history so I'm one of
 
04:29:21.889 --> 04:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
those folks I start talking about and I
 
04:29:23.570 --> 04:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
just kind of go on and on and on about
 
04:29:26.450 --> 04:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
it but it does directly tie into Civics
 
04:29:29.450 --> 04:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
because you need that background and
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
really what this bill tries to do is set
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
those parameters and get that necessary
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
education for these kids that's uniform
 
04:29:42.050 --> 04:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
and so hopefully everyone's learning the
 
04:29:43.610 --> 04:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
same thing there'll be a little little
 
04:29:46.729 --> 04:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
variations of course but it's that basic
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
background that we're looking for this
 
04:29:50.640 --> 04:29:51.370 align:start position:0%
background that we're looking for this
um

04:29:51.370 --> 04:29:51.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:53.929 --> 04:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
came at the request of Administrators
 
04:29:57.530 --> 04:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
and students I've had the pleasure of
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
attending a 603 Civics presentation that
 
04:30:04.250 --> 04:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
was done in our state supreme court and
 
04:30:06.649 --> 04:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you how pleasant it was to
 
04:30:08.410 --> 04:30:08.420 align:start position:0%
see these young children
 
04:30:11.530 --> 04:30:11.540 align:start position:0%
participating in our in our government
 
04:30:15.170 --> 04:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
and it's it just really I think is was
 
04:30:17.630 --> 04:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
just wonderful and I hope that this
 
04:30:19.670 --> 04:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee if you have the opportunity to
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
attend an event for
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
um for this
 
04:30:27.889 --> 04:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
um 603 Civic 603 that you do that
 
04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
um it's great to see these kids
 
04:30:29.279 --> 04:30:31.130 align:start position:0%
um it's great to see these kids
participate

04:30:31.130 --> 04:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
participate
 
04:30:34.429 --> 04:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
um and so Mr chairman I could go on on
 
04:30:36.830 --> 04:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
and on and all they I know it's a long
 
04:30:39.530 --> 04:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
it's been a long day for you folks and
 
04:30:41.630 --> 04:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
as a teacher I kind of know when it's
 
04:30:44.750 --> 04:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
time to stop because I I could go on and
 
04:30:46.969 --> 04:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
talk about the English Civil War and the
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
impact on yeah you don't need that so
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
anyway I hope the committee looks
 
04:30:53.630 --> 04:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
favorably on this bill
 
04:30:55.750 --> 04:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
um there are folks from Civic 603 here
 
04:30:59.450 --> 04:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
that can answer your questions and again
 
04:31:01.490 --> 04:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
I hope you look favorably on this Bill
 
04:31:03.889 --> 04:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you very
 
04:31:05.450 --> 04:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions for the
 
04:31:05.460 --> 04:31:06.649 align:start position:0%
much are there any questions for the
senator

04:31:06.649 --> 04:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
senator
 
04:31:09.889 --> 04:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
oh hands go up representative Cornell
 
04:31:11.870 --> 04:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
Thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
question this doesn't seem to have a
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
specific curriculum attached to it so it
 
04:31:17.870 --> 04:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
does leave it up to the Local District
 
04:31:20.269 --> 04:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
to develop their own
 
04:31:22.849 --> 04:31:22.859 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that that is
 
04:31:25.490 --> 04:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
part of it the bill was amended in the
 
04:31:27.530 --> 04:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
Senate and I did not get an opportunity
 
04:31:31.130 --> 04:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
to really purview that Amendment so if
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
that very well could have happened
 
04:31:35.870 --> 04:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
um in the uh Senate education thank you
 
04:31:37.610 --> 04:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
you're welcome represent McDonald did
 
04:31:40.010 --> 04:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up thank you Mr chair
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you Senator Carson I would
 
04:31:44.450 --> 04:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
agree with you that Civics rarely is not
 
04:31:46.250 --> 04:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
taught the way that it used to be or
 
04:31:48.769 --> 04:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
that it should be I see within this bill
 
04:31:51.710 --> 04:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
specifically page two you have ABC right
 
04:31:54.649 --> 04:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
at the top lines five for seven and it
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
says opportunities and responsibilities
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
for civic involvement in your experience
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
as a teacher would you say that students
 
04:32:04.250 --> 04:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
who understand how government functions
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
are more likely to be involved and that
 
04:32:07.910 --> 04:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
this this bill would have the positive
 
04:32:10.370 --> 04:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
influence on increasing let's say voter
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
turnout or citizen participation in
 
04:32:12.479 --> 04:32:13.370 align:start position:0%
turnout or citizen participation in
government

04:32:13.370 --> 04:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:32:16.070 --> 04:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes I firmly agree that if you
 
04:32:19.250 --> 04:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
understand it you'll participate thank
 
04:32:19.260 --> 04:32:19.969 align:start position:0%
understand it you'll participate thank
you

04:32:19.969 --> 04:32:19.979 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:32:22.849 --> 04:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
further questions represent Belcher
 
04:32:24.410 --> 04:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:32:26.330 --> 04:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question I love a lot of this
 
04:32:28.189 --> 04:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
stuff I I really love the idea of
 
04:32:30.110 --> 04:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
expanding Civics the Declaration of
 
04:32:32.030 --> 04:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
Independence and other things there's
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
one question I have that's a little bit
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
of a concern based on actually testimony
 
04:32:37.910 --> 04:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
we heard just a little bit earlier in
 
04:32:40.250 --> 04:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
the day when there was a bill that came
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
up and non-public schools were um
 
04:32:44.990 --> 04:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
brought up and the Department of
 
04:32:47.149 --> 04:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
Education seemed to testify that that
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
would that that would include
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
um such things as homeschool collectives
 
04:32:53.750 --> 04:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
is that something that this bill would
 
04:32:55.490 --> 04:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
be applicable to
 
04:32:57.290 --> 04:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question I really
 
04:32:59.149 --> 04:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
cannot answer that
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
um because it was my understanding we're
 
04:33:05.090 --> 04:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
looking at Public Schools so so
 
04:33:08.090 --> 04:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
um this curriculum but again there are
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
folks here who probably can answer that
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
question for you I I just don't have the
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
knowledge and I'm not going to mislead
 
04:33:15.289 --> 04:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
04:33:18.769 --> 04:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
I do have a question for you um
 
04:33:21.529 --> 04:33:21.539 align:start position:0%
I was also a history major geography
 
04:33:24.769 --> 04:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
major in that first degree
 
04:33:27.230 --> 04:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
um and happened to write the main
 
04:33:28.730 --> 04:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
studies curriculum which dealt with
 
04:33:30.890 --> 04:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
social studies for grades K through 12
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
in Maine yeah down east spotted out
 
04:33:38.590 --> 04:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
um I have a difficult time
 
04:33:40.730 --> 04:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
divorcing and you've mentioned it
 
04:33:42.051 --> 04:33:42.061 align:start position:0%
several times for example I'm talking
 
04:33:44.090 --> 04:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
about Shay's Rebellion a rebellion
 
04:33:46.849 --> 04:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
against taxes and all that in the state
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
next door to us right now or south of us
 
04:33:51.289 --> 04:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts western Mass
 
04:33:53.590 --> 04:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
um how do you divorce teaching history
 
04:33:56.689 --> 04:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
Civics and government if you're going to
 
04:33:58.609 --> 04:33:58.619 align:start position:0%
really and I noticed that you're you can
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
embed this in the Elementary grades as
 
04:34:03.470 --> 04:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
you so desire that's wonderful idea
 
04:34:05.449 --> 04:34:05.459 align:start position:0%
um why not why can't you do that in in
 
04:34:07.310 --> 04:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
the in the middle school as well where
 
04:34:09.830 --> 04:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
you have it you shall teach a course in
 
04:34:09.840 --> 04:34:11.990 align:start position:0%
you have it you shall teach a course in
civics

04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
civics
 
04:34:16.730 --> 04:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
um why not Civics slash government
 
04:34:18.650 --> 04:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
slash history
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman you're preaching to the
 
04:34:23.209 --> 04:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
choir okay I mean we can we can talk

going to tell you three of my favorite
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
reasons why this is so important there
 
04:38:04.910 --> 04:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
are so many and you're going to hear a
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
lot of reasons today but my favorite
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
reasons and ones that are close to my
 
04:38:10.080 --> 04:38:10.970 align:start position:0%
reasons and ones that are close to my
heart

04:38:10.970 --> 04:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
heart
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
Civics education has the potential to
 
04:38:16.970 --> 04:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
unite our state and our country and to
 
04:38:19.250 --> 04:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
help us move on together to solve
 
04:38:21.769 --> 04:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
problems in spite of differences of
 
04:38:21.779 --> 04:38:22.910 align:start position:0%
problems in spite of differences of
opinion

04:38:22.910 --> 04:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
in a poll taken recently by Dr Frank
 
04:38:29.330 --> 04:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
Lutz for civics now it was found that 56
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
percent of Democrats and 56 percent of
 
04:38:35.209 --> 04:38:35.219 align:start position:0%
Republicans thought Civics education was
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
the best way to unify as a country and
 
04:38:40.131 --> 04:38:40.141 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
04:38:42.650 --> 04:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
um that is in you know in comparing it
 
04:38:44.330 --> 04:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
to things like national service and
 
04:38:46.189 --> 04:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
other other ways to to bring people
 
04:38:46.199 --> 04:38:47.510 align:start position:0%
other other ways to to bring people
together

04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:38:50.090 --> 04:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
we know this is the second reason we
 
04:38:51.769 --> 04:38:51.779 align:start position:0%
know that Civics and the social studies
 
04:38:53.390 --> 04:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
in general
 
04:38:55.849 --> 04:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
have been marginalized have been back
 
04:38:58.730 --> 04:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
burnered for several reasons including
 
04:39:00.289 --> 04:39:00.299 align:start position:0%
the enactment of the No Child Left
 
04:39:00.299 --> 04:39:02.090 align:start position:0%
the enactment of the No Child Left
Behind

04:39:02.090 --> 04:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
Behind
 
04:39:06.051 --> 04:39:06.061 align:start position:0%
laws of federal laws um that started in
 
04:39:10.010 --> 04:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
the early 2000s since that time about 20
 
04:39:13.250 --> 04:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
years ago 44 of school districts have
 
04:39:15.709 --> 04:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
reduced time for social studies
 
04:39:18.349 --> 04:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
social studies receives the least amount
 
04:39:20.090 --> 04:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
of instructional time in Elementary
 
04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
grades when compared to the amount of
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
my third and the last one I will share
 
04:39:31.551 --> 04:39:31.561 align:start position:0%
is that the preparation for civic life
 
04:39:34.131 --> 04:39:34.141 align:start position:0%
was the original purpose of public
 
04:39:34.141 --> 04:39:36.230 align:start position:0%
was the original purpose of public
schools

04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:39:36.240 --> 04:39:36.949 align:start position:0%
schools
um

04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:40.610 --> 04:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:43.368 --> 04:39:43.378 align:start position:0%
our constitutional democracy won't last
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
without better and more Civics education
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
we know that students who receive
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
effective and high quality Civics
 
04:39:52.090 --> 04:39:52.100 align:start position:0%
education as um
 
04:39:55.250 --> 04:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald made reference
 
04:39:57.288 --> 04:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
to they're more likely to vote
 
04:39:59.090 --> 04:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
they're four times more likely to
 
04:40:01.070 --> 04:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer and work with their neighbors
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
on community issues
 
04:40:04.850 --> 04:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
they're more confident in their ability
 
04:40:07.010 --> 04:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
to speak publicly and to communicate
 
04:40:09.350 --> 04:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
with elected representatives
 
04:40:12.590 --> 04:40:12.600 align:start position:0%

um a report that was done uh maybe 12 14
 
04:41:16.368 --> 04:41:16.378 align:start position:0%
years ago about Civics instruction in
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I I believe Justice
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
from Justice Suiter and maybe even
 
04:41:22.190 --> 04:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
Sandra Day O'Connor were involved in
 
04:41:23.750 --> 04:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
that report
 
04:41:26.570 --> 04:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
um and it reading this reminded me of
 
04:41:28.670 --> 04:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
that because maybe you can correct me if
 
04:41:31.010 --> 04:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong if you remember it but I think
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
it talked about New Hampshire leading
 
04:41:34.990 --> 04:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
the nation and having Civics instruction
 
04:41:38.090 --> 04:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
at every grade level beginning at
 
04:41:40.850 --> 04:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
kindergarten level do you recall that by
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
any chance yes
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure about a report but I
 
04:41:48.948 --> 04:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
know that both Justice Suiter and um
 
04:41:52.250 --> 04:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
just Justice O'Connor came to Concord
 
04:41:54.110 --> 04:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
and spoke about the importance of civics
 
04:41:56.690 --> 04:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
education and the danger
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
um of of having a citizenry that is
 
04:42:04.368 --> 04:42:04.378 align:start position:0%
ignorant about how they can have their
 
04:42:07.430 --> 04:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
voices heard how the government works uh
 
04:42:09.770 --> 04:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
how dangerous that was
 
04:42:11.390 --> 04:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if that is what you
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
are making reference to but
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
um certainly you know the Supreme Court
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
Justices are very concerned it doesn't
 
04:42:20.090 --> 04:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
matter if you know what
 
04:42:22.010 --> 04:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
um side of the
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
um aisle you're on whether it's just a
 
04:42:27.050 --> 04:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
Sotomayor um Justice Gorsuch they you
 
04:42:28.850 --> 04:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
know Justice Roberts they're all very
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about this issue so it seems
 
04:42:31.850 --> 04:42:31.860 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
um important to them because they I
 
04:42:36.410 --> 04:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
think they see sort of the results of of
 
04:42:39.948 --> 04:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
not having it very clearly yeah yes
 
04:42:42.350 --> 04:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden thank you Mr
 
04:42:43.910 --> 04:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:42:46.190 --> 04:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
it's just for clarification
 
04:42:46.200 --> 04:42:47.090 align:start position:0%
it's just for clarification
um

04:42:47.090 --> 04:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
because I am familiar with with the bell
 
04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
and and definitely needs to be on the
 
04:42:54.470 --> 04:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
books but my question is in regards to
 
04:42:57.530 --> 04:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
the assessments so every student who
 
04:42:59.810 --> 04:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
takes a Civics course has to take a
 
04:43:02.750 --> 04:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
locally developed assessment
 
04:43:04.670 --> 04:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
and they're required to take the
 
04:43:08.330 --> 04:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
Naturalization examination as well
 
04:43:11.390 --> 04:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
to graduate I think that's what it is
 
04:43:13.190 --> 04:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
right now in high school okay that was
 
04:43:17.090 --> 04:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
my question this is it's now yeah um but
 
04:43:18.530 --> 04:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
this is something different this is
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
focused on k through eight
 
04:43:21.120 --> 04:43:22.128 align:start position:0%
focused on k through eight
um because

04:43:22.128 --> 04:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
um because
 
04:43:22.138 --> 04:43:22.850 align:start position:0%
um because
um

04:43:22.850 --> 04:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:26.930 --> 04:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
it's not enough to introduce a new topic
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
to students
 
04:43:31.788 --> 04:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
um you know in their senior year when
 
04:43:33.830 --> 04:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
they're halfway out the door
 
04:43:36.350 --> 04:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
um I I want to respond also to the time
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
question about integrating with with
 
04:43:40.910 --> 04:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
history and and
 
04:43:42.590 --> 04:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
um you certainly can do that in
 
04:43:44.150 --> 04:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
elementary school there's a little more
 
04:43:46.550 --> 04:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
time in elementary school so we have to
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
integrate right with music with art with
 
04:43:52.850 --> 04:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
literacy with classroom management there
 
04:43:55.788 --> 04:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
are many many easy ways for for teachers
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
to do that and it's almost just a mind
 
04:44:00.050 --> 04:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
shift and some really good professional
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
development I mean we have kindergarten
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
teachers who are teaching coding now so
 
04:44:08.030 --> 04:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
if they can do that
 
04:44:09.590 --> 04:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
um they were trained to do that they
 
04:44:11.570 --> 04:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
didn't go to school you know to college
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
to learn about coding they were trained
 
04:44:17.570 --> 04:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
by the stem Community to teach coding in
 
04:44:19.490 --> 04:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
kindergarten they can do that so if they
 
04:44:21.530 --> 04:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
can do that um
 
04:44:23.810 --> 04:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
we can we can support our elementary
 
04:44:26.690 --> 04:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
school teachers to integrate Civics into
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
what they are already doing
 
04:44:30.948 --> 04:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I answered your question
 
04:44:34.490 --> 04:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
um in the bill it does it it's the
 
04:44:37.128 --> 04:44:37.138 align:start position:0%
expectation that it would be required at
 
04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
the elementary level or just integrated
 
04:44:40.730 --> 04:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
within the curriculum yeah this doesn't
 
04:44:42.770 --> 04:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
have an assessment okay attached to it
 
04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
although you know we didn't change the
 
04:44:46.670 --> 04:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
other the high school
 
04:44:48.830 --> 04:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
um policies at all okay but we're
 
04:44:51.670 --> 04:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
proposing that it starts in kindergarten
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
we know that it's too late right the way
 
04:44:56.990 --> 04:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
it is is done right now the other thing
 
04:44:58.730 --> 04:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
about history is the history keeps
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
getting longer and longer yes and I know
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
my own my own kids they learned sort of
 
04:45:08.810 --> 04:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
you know Colonial period through
 
04:45:12.050 --> 04:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
um maybe reconstruction several times in
 
04:45:13.970 --> 04:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
school they learned that over and over
 
04:45:17.090 --> 04:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
and they never even got to Vietnam and
 
04:45:19.730 --> 04:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
so what this is doing is saying yes
 
04:45:21.410 --> 04:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
that's all important history is super
 
04:45:24.410 --> 04:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
important but if we you know history
 
04:45:26.750 --> 04:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
keeps getting larger we need to carve
 
04:45:29.090 --> 04:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
out some time specifically for civics
 
04:45:32.208 --> 04:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
because it's getting lost in the history
 
04:45:32.218 --> 04:45:33.650 align:start position:0%
because it's getting lost in the history
curriculum

04:45:33.650 --> 04:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
um and it's really really important not
 
04:45:37.368 --> 04:45:37.378 align:start position:0%
to say that you can't teach them in an
 
04:45:39.470 --> 04:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
integrated way you can but it's not
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
always done and it's important that it
 
04:45:43.610 --> 04:45:43.620 align:start position:0%
be focused on right now and it was
 
04:45:45.890 --> 04:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
integrated in the past
 
04:45:45.900 --> 04:45:46.550 align:start position:0%
integrated in the past
um

04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
as part of just teaching thank you
 
04:45:51.948 --> 04:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
representative Meyer did you have your
 
04:45:51.958 --> 04:45:53.150 align:start position:0%
representative Meyer did you have your
hand

04:45:53.150 --> 04:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
hand
 
04:45:55.490 --> 04:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and thank you
 
04:45:57.770 --> 04:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you we
 
04:46:00.910 --> 04:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
currently have in the law
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh the teaching of government and Civics
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's noted here this expands it to the
 
04:46:10.788 --> 04:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
elementary schools
 
04:46:13.128 --> 04:46:13.138 align:start position:0%
but my sense is that the reason why this
 
04:46:14.750 --> 04:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
has come before us
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
is that even though it's been in the law
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's not being taught enough
 
04:46:23.690 --> 04:46:23.700 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
why do you think the passage of this law
 
04:46:30.530 --> 04:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
since it's already in the law
 
04:46:34.730 --> 04:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
would demand greater teaching of it
 
04:46:37.430 --> 04:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
well um
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
I think there was some confusion because
 
04:46:42.050 --> 04:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
the the first iteration of this law that
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
I saw said no later than grade eight I
 
04:46:47.810 --> 04:46:47.820 align:start position:0%
believe so there is a change within this
 
04:46:49.490 --> 04:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
law I think there was some inconsistency
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
because elsewhere it talked about K-12
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
but in this lot we're making it
 
04:46:58.850 --> 04:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
consistent so that it should be clear
 
04:47:00.410 --> 04:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
that it should be getting in
 
04:47:04.010 --> 04:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and it should be taught in
 
04:47:05.810 --> 04:47:05.820 align:start position:0%
an integrated way
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
through great through grade five and
 
04:47:12.590 --> 04:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
then in grade six seven or eight and
 
04:47:15.230 --> 04:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
again there's flexibility there for
 
04:47:17.690 --> 04:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
localities to do it however they want
 
04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
but somewhere in those grades of six
 
04:47:22.670 --> 04:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
seven or eight there should be the
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a half year of civics
 
04:47:27.948 --> 04:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
and we know that middle school is a
 
04:47:31.128 --> 04:47:31.138 align:start position:0%
great time to teach Civics because these
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
young people are starting to think like
 
04:47:33.120 --> 04:47:34.128 align:start position:0%
young people are starting to think like
adults

04:47:34.128 --> 04:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
adults
 
04:47:36.410 --> 04:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
and yeah and and they're not jaded yet
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know like a senior in high school
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
might be like oh you know rolling their
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
eyes about whatever
 
04:47:44.570 --> 04:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
um we know developmentally that middle
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
school is a really terrific time to
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
introduce cynics and I and
 
04:47:52.490 --> 04:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think that's done in a
 
04:47:55.448 --> 04:47:55.458 align:start position:0%
consistent way in our state thank you so
 
04:47:58.490 --> 04:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
further a represent luno
 
04:48:00.590 --> 04:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thank
 
04:48:02.570 --> 04:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
you Martha for joining us this thank you
 
04:48:05.208 --> 04:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
and I know you've you've worked uh many
 
04:48:07.550 --> 04:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
years on this and it's involved a lot of
 
04:48:09.890 --> 04:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
people a lot of stakeholders and and
 
04:48:11.570 --> 04:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
they're really really complement the
 
04:48:13.970 --> 04:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
effort to to Really thanks but fourth I
 
04:48:16.730 --> 04:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
think you know a a bill that really does
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
provide some comprehensive reforms and
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
improvements to our to the framework for
 
04:48:25.128 --> 04:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
our Civics education both at the um at
 
04:48:28.010 --> 04:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
the elementary middle and um and at the
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
high school level too
 
04:48:32.750 --> 04:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
um but what I wanted to focus on was um
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
was it the is it the high school level
 
04:48:38.810 --> 04:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
and there there is a um there is a
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
provision in existing law that uh Dr
 
04:48:43.850 --> 04:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
cascadden I think had had
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
um had had uh asked about uh you said
 
04:48:50.208 --> 04:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's an existing law and uh
 
04:48:52.670 --> 04:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
that provision came into being I think
 
04:48:57.530 --> 04:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
two years ago uh maybe uh uh devoid of
 
04:49:00.050 --> 04:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
any instruction devoid of any curriculum
 
04:49:02.330 --> 04:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
it was just a graduation requirement
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
where um where every every High School
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
in order to graduate from high school
 
04:49:10.670 --> 04:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
you had to get a 70 or better on 128
 
04:49:14.930 --> 04:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
question naturalization exam and uh with
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely no curriculum behind it at
 
04:49:18.410 --> 04:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
all and so
 
04:49:19.910 --> 04:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
04:49:23.208 --> 04:49:23.218 align:start position:0%
um you know as part of any bill you can
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
amend existing language too
 
04:49:28.910 --> 04:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
um the when that bill was presented to
 
04:49:28.920 --> 04:49:29.690 align:start position:0%
um the when that bill was presented to
us

04:49:29.690 --> 04:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:49:32.690 --> 04:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
um the prime sponsor said that the um
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
that the knowledge would just wash over
 
04:49:37.010 --> 04:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
the students and I noticed you didn't
 
04:49:39.410 --> 04:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
use that type of language at all when
 
04:49:41.390 --> 04:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
talking about what students would learn
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
through from the Frank when the Frank
 
04:49:46.128 --> 04:49:46.138 align:start position:0%
using the framework that that you've got
 
04:49:49.610 --> 04:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
here but I do have a concern and um and
 
04:49:51.010 --> 04:49:51.020 align:start position:0%
just want to ask you
 
04:49:55.310 --> 04:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
on the on the first page will the half
 
04:49:58.730 --> 04:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
year or how will the half year course
 
04:50:01.330 --> 04:50:01.340 align:start position:0%
of instruction so this is on line 17
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
Civics in high school required for high
 
04:50:05.810 --> 04:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
school graduation
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
and then the definitions of civics
 
04:50:13.310 --> 04:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
um in lines 19 through 30. how will that
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
prepare students to take that high
 
04:50:21.530 --> 04:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
stakes 128 question wash over me wash
 
04:50:23.628 --> 04:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
the answers wash over me
 
04:50:23.638 --> 04:50:25.690 align:start position:0%
the answers wash over me
um

04:50:25.690 --> 04:50:25.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:27.770 --> 04:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
naturalization tests required for
 
04:50:31.670 --> 04:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
graduation well I think um
 
04:50:33.770 --> 04:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
you know we can we can certainly have a
 
04:50:37.550 --> 04:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
debate about pedagogy I you know my
 
04:50:39.530 --> 04:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
personal opinion isn't really relevant
 
04:50:41.690 --> 04:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
here we have worked really hard to
 
04:50:44.330 --> 04:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
create consensus
 
04:50:48.650 --> 04:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
um and so while I feel that um a
 
04:50:50.510 --> 04:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
multiple choice test I personally feel
 
04:50:52.788 --> 04:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
that that's not the best way to instruct
 
04:50:55.490 --> 04:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
people I also know that testing drives
 
04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
instruction so even if you have a really
 
04:50:59.230 --> 04:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
poor test
 
04:51:02.330 --> 04:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
if teachers are trying to ready their
 
04:51:05.448 --> 04:51:05.458 align:start position:0%
kids for that test they can't help alert
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
something I don't have an objection to
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
people knowing facts I think facts are
 
04:51:12.708 --> 04:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
important but if you don't know how to
 
04:51:14.810 --> 04:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
use them and you're not critical about
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
where you find those facts and you don't
 
04:51:20.448 --> 04:51:20.458 align:start position:0%
think about who is choosing those
 
04:51:22.550 --> 04:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
questions you know which questions are
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
left out I think you know um but you
 
04:51:29.390 --> 04:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
know we as a coalition did not really
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
monkey around with what was already
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
there we didn't go there
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and I you know I think that's for
 
04:51:40.250 --> 04:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
another project what we were doing you
 
04:51:42.470 --> 04:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
know today what we're doing today is
 
04:51:45.650 --> 04:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
asking for more time to prepare students
 
04:51:48.288 --> 04:51:48.298 align:start position:0%
not only to take that test but to
 
04:51:50.330 --> 04:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
actually be good citizens and know how
 
04:51:52.970 --> 04:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
to participate as they get older
 
04:51:52.980 --> 04:51:54.470 align:start position:0%
to participate as they get older
um

04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:55.788 --> 04:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answers your
 
04:51:59.090 --> 04:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
question but it helps a lot yeah it's
 
04:52:01.730 --> 04:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
not yeah it's this is a you know all of
 
04:52:03.890 --> 04:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
this is is compromise and that's one
 
04:52:05.208 --> 04:52:05.218 align:start position:0%
thing I don't think that you know
 
04:52:07.070 --> 04:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
students are learning enough about is
 
04:52:10.250 --> 04:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
that nothing like this isn't exactly how
 
04:52:13.010 --> 04:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
I would put it right but this is what
 
04:52:14.350 --> 04:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
the group
 
04:52:17.868 --> 04:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
you know a couple of years of work has
 
04:52:19.970 --> 04:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
put forth for now and we're not going to
 
04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
get we're not stopping we're going to
 
04:52:25.010 --> 04:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
continue to work but for now we feel
 
04:52:26.990 --> 04:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:52:28.970 --> 04:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
whether it's for the test or whether
 
04:52:31.550 --> 04:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's for being a good citizen or for
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
whatever reason we're going to have more
 
04:52:35.868 --> 04:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
success if we start earlier and that
 
04:52:37.510 --> 04:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
young people have that Foundation
 
04:52:39.530 --> 04:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
foundational knowledge so that when they
 
04:52:40.730 --> 04:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
get to high school they have something
 
04:52:42.170 --> 04:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
to pull on they have some prior
 
04:52:44.690 --> 04:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
knowledge to connect
 
04:52:47.628 --> 04:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
to right and so it's going to stick and
 
04:52:48.770 --> 04:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
they're going to remember it more it's
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
going to be more meaningful to them if
 
04:52:53.410 --> 04:52:53.420 align:start position:0%
they have a context for it
 
04:52:55.850 --> 04:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much represent
 
04:52:55.860 --> 04:52:57.128 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much represent
Belcher

04:52:57.128 --> 04:52:57.138 align:start position:0%
Belcher
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for uh
 
04:53:01.970 --> 04:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
for being here for your testimony
 
04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
um so obviously Civics is incredibly
 
04:53:06.350 --> 04:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
important it's something that we need to
 
04:53:09.050 --> 04:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
focus on and get into uh curriculum
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
um no disagreements there I believe you
 
04:53:14.690 --> 04:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
said your group New Hampshire Civics
 
04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
um very involved with this your
 
04:53:18.530 --> 04:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan group yes um I did go to the
 
04:53:20.270 --> 04:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
website real quick just to see exactly
 
04:53:21.830 --> 04:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
what is happening
 
04:53:24.288 --> 04:53:24.298 align:start position:0%
um and what is being recommended and
 
04:53:25.970 --> 04:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
when I click on educator resources one
 
04:53:27.288 --> 04:53:27.298 align:start position:0%
of the first things that comes up is an
 
04:53:29.208 --> 04:53:29.218 align:start position:0%
article called what kind of Citizen the
 
04:53:32.570 --> 04:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
politics of educating for democracy that
 
04:53:34.788 --> 04:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
goes on to denigrate the conservative
 
04:53:38.810 --> 04:53:38.820 align:start position:0%
view of the word citizen as narrow and
 
04:53:38.820 --> 04:53:40.368 align:start position:0%
view of the word citizen as narrow and
ideological

04:53:40.368 --> 04:53:40.378 align:start position:0%
ideological
 
04:53:44.208 --> 04:53:44.218 align:start position:0%
and insufficiently good for democracy
 
04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
and Justice oriented so I guess my
 
04:53:48.890 --> 04:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
question is exactly how nonpartisan is
 
04:53:48.900 --> 04:53:50.030 align:start position:0%
question is exactly how nonpartisan is
this

04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
this is completely completely
 
04:53:54.110 --> 04:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan as you
 
04:53:56.690 --> 04:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
um could see from the sport in the
 
04:53:56.700 --> 04:53:58.070 align:start position:0%
um could see from the sport in the
Senate

04:53:58.070 --> 04:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
04:54:00.830 --> 04:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
um we've had speakers of all Stripes
 
04:54:02.810 --> 04:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
come and speak and right I think that
 
04:54:05.690 --> 04:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
was a Joel Westheimer event but we've
 
04:54:08.510 --> 04:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
had Susan Collins come and we've had you
 
04:54:11.930 --> 04:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
know that a republican appointed Supreme
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
Court Justices come to speak so we are
 
04:54:17.810 --> 04:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
very aware that we need to be balanced
 
04:54:19.368 --> 04:54:19.378 align:start position:0%
in our approach because otherwise we
 
04:54:21.770 --> 04:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of credibility right we
 
04:54:23.530 --> 04:54:23.540 align:start position:0%
really do want
 
04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
participation informed participation
 
04:54:29.990 --> 04:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
but we do not have a political
 
04:54:32.030 --> 04:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
orientation at all
 
04:54:34.368 --> 04:54:34.378 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions represent
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
Allison oh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:54:39.230 --> 04:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and you
 
04:54:42.110 --> 04:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
may not be the right person to to answer
 
04:54:43.910 --> 04:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
this I'm going to ask you anyways okay
 
04:54:46.850 --> 04:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
uh just I I like the way the bill is
 
04:54:49.850 --> 04:54:49.860 align:start position:0%
laid out I like the requirements as a
 
04:54:52.010 --> 04:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
former social studies teacher and now
 
04:54:54.770 --> 04:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
being on this committee for for five
 
04:54:54.780 --> 04:54:55.850 align:start position:0%
being on this committee for for five
years

04:54:55.850 --> 04:54:55.860 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
what we might want to happen in the
 
04:55:00.230 --> 04:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
local schools and what does happen can
 
04:55:02.628 --> 04:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
be two different things was there any
 
04:55:04.970 --> 04:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
discussion with a lot of discussion on
 
04:55:06.470 --> 04:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
all of this but was any of that
 
04:55:11.090 --> 04:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
discussion uh about how do we know that
 
04:55:13.610 --> 04:55:13.620 align:start position:0%
you know the high schools are teaching
 
04:55:16.010 --> 04:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
what we thought they should teach or how
 
04:55:17.868 --> 04:55:17.878 align:start position:0%
are they is there was there any
 
04:55:20.330 --> 04:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
discussion about mechanism for trying to
 
04:55:22.550 --> 04:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
figure that out one year down the road
 
04:55:25.550 --> 04:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
two years down the road
 
04:55:25.560 --> 04:55:26.690 align:start position:0%
two years down the road
um

04:55:26.690 --> 04:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
we feel that our Coalition we have
 
04:55:31.788 --> 04:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
people involved from the Department of
 
04:55:31.798 --> 04:55:33.110 align:start position:0%
people involved from the Department of
Education

04:55:33.110 --> 04:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
Education
 
04:55:36.288 --> 04:55:36.298 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know superintendents and
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
people principals people who have you
 
04:55:41.208 --> 04:55:41.218 align:start position:0%
know some some considerable power within
 
04:55:43.070 --> 04:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
the structure and
 
04:55:43.080 --> 04:55:44.810 align:start position:0%
the structure and
um

04:55:44.810 --> 04:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:49.010 --> 04:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
so we feel that the Coalition will be a
 
04:55:51.470 --> 04:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
good check to see if this bill is making
 
04:55:54.530 --> 04:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
a difference if people if if teachers
 
04:55:55.788 --> 04:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
are actually
 
04:55:58.128 --> 04:55:58.138 align:start position:0%
teaching this and following through and
 
04:56:00.770 --> 04:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
what the results are
 
04:56:03.470 --> 04:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
so that's that's how we we're viewing
 
04:56:07.550 --> 04:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
the Coalition as an informal body that
 
04:56:10.970 --> 04:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
would be very Vigilant about this
 
04:56:13.368 --> 04:56:13.378 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:56:15.890 --> 04:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to just ask it try to ask
 
04:56:21.708 --> 04:56:21.718 align:start position:0%
it in the form of a question
 
04:56:23.930 --> 04:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
and I think that either represent mile
 
04:56:27.410 --> 04:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
or represent luno alluded to this
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
um we've had in fact it was Senator
 
04:56:32.570 --> 04:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
dalessandro myself
 
04:56:35.270 --> 04:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
who wrote part of this here and we stole
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
it from Ohio really and
 
04:56:42.288 --> 04:56:42.298 align:start position:0%
we put it in because we felt that this
 
04:56:45.170 --> 04:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
stuff wasn't being taught
 
04:56:48.110 --> 04:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
I also remember when
 
04:56:51.170 --> 04:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
Mary guile and Mary Heath were on this
 
04:56:52.910 --> 04:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee at a time that's dating it
 
04:56:55.190 --> 04:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
back a while and we have the Statewide
 
04:56:55.200 --> 04:56:56.330 align:start position:0%
back a while and we have the Statewide
assessment

04:56:56.330 --> 04:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:56:58.730 --> 04:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
and the Statewide assessment was once
 
04:57:02.208 --> 04:57:02.218 align:start position:0%
inclusive of social studies
 
04:57:03.948 --> 04:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at the old Frameworks
 
04:57:06.650 --> 04:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
which were developed for social studies
 
04:57:10.430 --> 04:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
which background what 2008 thereabouts
 
04:57:14.448 --> 04:57:14.458 align:start position:0%
six eight and and
 
04:57:14.458 --> 04:57:15.110 align:start position:0%
six eight and and
um

04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:17.330 --> 04:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
so in those evidently become our
 
04:57:19.128 --> 04:57:19.138 align:start position:0%
standards I guess
 
04:57:22.010 --> 04:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
um so my concern is the question is if
 
04:57:23.930 --> 04:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
in fact we've had some of this onboard
 
04:57:23.940 --> 04:57:25.788 align:start position:0%
in fact we've had some of this onboard
in-law

04:57:25.788 --> 04:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
in-law
 
04:57:28.730 --> 04:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
yeah how do we ensure it is taught in
 
04:57:31.368 --> 04:57:31.378 align:start position:0%
these schools when the schools have the
 
04:57:33.530 --> 04:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility for instruction and
 
04:57:35.448 --> 04:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
curriculum we have the responsibility
 
04:57:38.510 --> 04:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
for academic standards the way if we put
 
04:57:41.208 --> 04:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
this note there but how do we do we put
 
04:57:43.550 --> 04:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
forth another Statewide assessment of
 
04:57:44.628 --> 04:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
some kind
 
04:57:47.090 --> 04:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
or involve it in the annual Statewide
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
assessment or or there's lots of
 
04:57:52.368 --> 04:57:52.378 align:start position:0%
different ways of assessing too you know
 
04:57:55.250 --> 04:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
portfolios the whole nine yards so I
 
04:57:56.868 --> 04:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
guess that's where I'm hung up yeah we
 
04:57:58.810 --> 04:57:58.820 align:start position:0%
haven't really gotten to that yet
 
04:58:02.090 --> 04:58:02.100 align:start position:0%
assessment is one of those policies on
 
04:58:04.070 --> 04:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
the policy menu that we're you know
 
04:58:06.110 --> 04:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
we've considered
 
04:58:10.490 --> 04:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and I guess we feel that um that
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
right now the assessment is this
 
04:58:15.050 --> 04:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
naturalization test that's a very high
 
04:58:18.430 --> 04:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
stakes test it's attached to graduation
 
04:58:21.650 --> 04:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
so we better get together if we're if
 
04:58:23.690 --> 04:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the assessment we
 
04:58:26.270 --> 04:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
better spend some time on it right we
 
04:58:27.890 --> 04:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
don't want people not to be graduating
 
04:58:29.390 --> 04:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
from high school
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
um but that yeah I think that's an
 
04:58:33.708 --> 04:58:33.718 align:start position:0%
important question I personally love the
 
04:58:36.050 --> 04:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
like a digital portfolio as an
 
04:58:39.050 --> 04:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
assessment but again I'm not in charge
 
04:58:42.170 --> 04:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
of everything so that would be my
 
04:58:43.910 --> 04:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
preference is to have something that
 
04:58:46.010 --> 04:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
that starts in kindergarten and sort of
 
04:58:49.730 --> 04:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
tracks that person's Civic life Civic
 
04:58:53.530 --> 04:58:53.540 align:start position:0%
learning through high school so
 
04:58:56.448 --> 04:58:56.458 align:start position:0%
oh but again and what we want to do is
 
04:58:59.570 --> 04:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
in a coalition is to be very supportive
 
04:59:02.330 --> 04:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
of teachers and one thing that Carl had
 
04:59:04.610 --> 04:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
asked for is a whole year before this is
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
implemented so that teachers and schools
 
04:59:08.810 --> 04:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
can get ready and get up to speed
 
04:59:10.910 --> 04:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
they're already doing a lot of things
 
04:59:15.110 --> 04:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
and they're like saturated so um what we
 
04:59:17.030 --> 04:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
want to do within the Coalition is make
 
04:59:19.250 --> 04:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
sure that teachers and administrators
 
04:59:21.890 --> 04:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
know about all the excellent resources
 
04:59:24.288 --> 04:59:24.298 align:start position:0%
that are out there
 
04:59:27.170 --> 04:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
um uh and and to really give them some
 
04:59:29.690 --> 04:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
support some professional development to
 
04:59:31.970 --> 04:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
make it easy for them to access
 
04:59:34.850 --> 04:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
easy for them to implement these things
 
04:59:38.090 --> 04:59:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Myler yeah thank you
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
for that clarification because uh
 
04:59:42.288 --> 04:59:42.298 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative LED that's my
 
04:59:44.330 --> 04:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
concern yeah is that you can you can
 
04:59:46.730 --> 04:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
pass all kinds of laws you want to but
 
04:59:48.890 --> 04:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
if there's nobody there to try to
 
04:59:50.448 --> 04:59:50.458 align:start position:0%
implement that law
 
04:59:52.490 --> 04:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
and then it just sits on the books and
 
04:59:54.050 --> 04:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
it's in the shelf of indecision
 
04:59:57.110 --> 04:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
basically so I I'm very pleased to hear
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
your commitment of your Coalition I've
 
05:00:02.270 --> 05:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
checked with the the social studies
 
05:00:04.368 --> 05:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
Teachers Association and they're
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
committed to this yes so I think if the
 
05:00:09.170 --> 05:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
Coalition follows through with this then
 
05:00:10.970 --> 05:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
in fact what you're saying in this law
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
that you're proposing then it will
 
05:00:14.990 --> 05:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
happen because those are the
 
05:00:16.788 --> 05:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
practitioners that are going to be
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
implementing it so right we've done the
 
05:00:20.330 --> 05:00:20.340 align:start position:0%
work clarification sir we've done the
 
05:00:22.250 --> 05:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
work and we you know not imposing
 
05:00:24.590 --> 05:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
something but asking people
 
05:00:26.990 --> 05:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
you know over two years trying to get
 
05:00:28.850 --> 05:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
find something that people agree on and
 
05:00:30.948 --> 05:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
this is what they've agreed on
 
05:00:32.628 --> 05:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
um I think having buy-in will make sure
 
05:00:33.948 --> 05:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
you know that's more makes it more
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
likely that people will actually
 
05:00:35.040 --> 05:00:36.530 align:start position:0%
likely that people will actually
implement

05:00:36.530 --> 05:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
implement
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
and also providing support with that to
 
05:00:39.360 --> 05:00:40.670 align:start position:0%
and also providing support with that to
them

05:00:40.670 --> 05:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:00:42.650 --> 05:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to take a moment and read
 
05:00:44.690 --> 05:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
the statute on this assessment because I
 
05:00:46.850 --> 05:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
think that's important it says history
 
05:00:49.730 --> 05:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
geography civics and economics remain
 
05:00:52.368 --> 05:00:52.378 align:start position:0%
required critical areas of study
 
05:00:54.948 --> 05:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
therefore assessment of these subjects
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
remains within the purview of the local
 
05:00:59.570 --> 05:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
school board
 
05:01:02.810 --> 05:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
so what we did because the state wasn't
 
05:01:02.820 --> 05:01:04.250 align:start position:0%
so what we did because the state wasn't
assessing

05:01:04.250 --> 05:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
assessing
 
05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
we knocked it down at that time to the
 
05:01:08.570 --> 05:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
local school board to ensure that it was
 
05:01:08.580 --> 05:01:09.350 align:start position:0%
local school board to ensure that it was
taught

05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
taught
 
05:01:11.448 --> 05:01:11.458 align:start position:0%
there were people on this committee at
 
05:01:12.830 --> 05:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
that time that didn't want to do that
 
05:01:12.840 --> 05:01:14.030 align:start position:0%
that time that didn't want to do that
either

05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
either
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
however we didn't have the Statewide
 
05:01:17.090 --> 05:01:17.100 align:start position:0%
assessment so we were just sort of in
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
this where do we go
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
so in order for this on and I I guess I
 
05:01:23.948 --> 05:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
shouldn't I should be asking questions
 
05:01:26.448 --> 05:01:26.458 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
05:01:28.730 --> 05:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
would you believe that you need to or we
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
all need to
 
05:01:32.868 --> 05:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
develop how we're going to hold people
 
05:01:35.628 --> 05:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
accountable for for the subject of
 
05:01:35.638 --> 05:01:37.510 align:start position:0%
accountable for for the subject of
civics

05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
civics
 
05:01:41.090 --> 05:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
the future policy question right yeah I
 
05:01:43.070 --> 05:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
think it's a future policy question I
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
think there is some accountability in in
 
05:01:47.690 --> 05:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
the testing that's there already
 
05:01:47.700 --> 05:01:48.350 align:start position:0%
the testing that's there already
um

05:01:48.350 --> 05:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:50.448 --> 05:01:50.458 align:start position:0%
and I think having buy-in and having
 
05:01:53.208 --> 05:01:53.218 align:start position:0%
support will go a long way but
 
05:01:56.090 --> 05:01:56.100 align:start position:0%
assessment is you know is is another is
 
05:01:57.530 --> 05:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
another piece that we could look at
 
05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
another time
 
05:02:02.750 --> 05:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
so further comments or questions from
 
05:02:05.810 --> 05:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
the committee here yes represent Damon
 
05:02:08.350 --> 05:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
05:02:11.570 --> 05:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
independent of that very credible and
 
05:02:16.030 --> 05:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:19.730 --> 05:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make this into a question
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
um on lines 27 through 30 when you list
 
05:02:26.400 --> 05:02:26.990 align:start position:0%
um on lines 27 through 30 when you list
um

05:02:26.990 --> 05:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:29.448 --> 05:02:29.458 align:start position:0%
some examples of
 
05:02:31.788 --> 05:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
topics to help with appreciation of free
 
05:02:33.830 --> 05:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
speech and civil discourse
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
and reflecting on your observation that
 
05:02:38.570 --> 05:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
your own children and I parallel the
 
05:02:40.610 --> 05:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
experience with mine
 
05:02:43.550 --> 05:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
had some repeated history learning over
 
05:02:45.650 --> 05:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
time and therefore did not get to
 
05:02:47.868 --> 05:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
current or more recent events very
 
05:02:50.990 --> 05:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:54.490 --> 05:02:54.500 align:start position:0%
I'd love to see the end of line 30
 
05:02:58.788 --> 05:02:58.798 align:start position:0%
additionally say and contemporary or
 
05:03:02.208 --> 05:03:02.218 align:start position:0%
maybe in current topics in civics
 
05:03:06.110 --> 05:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
because 1960s well certainly a very
 
05:03:08.510 --> 05:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
important part of civics is now a long
 
05:03:10.430 --> 05:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
time ago and lots of things have
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
happened and will happen going forward
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
so that isn't a question we're living
 
05:03:21.590 --> 05:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
the 1960s I lived it I did too I'm not
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
dissing the 1960s I'm just saying
 
05:03:25.730 --> 05:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
there's yet more right it keeps getting
 
05:03:25.740 --> 05:03:27.670 align:start position:0%
there's yet more right it keeps getting
longer

05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
longer
 
05:03:30.890 --> 05:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
anyway any further
 
05:03:32.930 --> 05:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
comments or questions
 
05:03:34.670 --> 05:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Martha thank you
 
05:03:36.530 --> 05:03:36.540 align:start position:0%

05:03:56.570 --> 05:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:58.610 --> 05:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman that distinguished

05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
bill over across the or over across the
 
05:04:07.128 --> 05:04:07.138 align:start position:0%
hall that we hopefully will get passed
 
05:04:09.470 --> 05:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
for the record I've said it alludalos
 
05:04:12.170 --> 05:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
who know I represent District 20. BHS
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
Awards two three four ten eleven and
 
05:04:18.830 --> 05:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
twelve and I could be for you as as one
 
05:04:20.570 --> 05:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
of the sponsors of the Civics piece of
 
05:04:20.580 --> 05:04:21.890 align:start position:0%
of the sponsors of the Civics piece of
legislation

05:04:21.890 --> 05:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:04:24.288 --> 05:04:24.298 align:start position:0%
now the chair and I have worked for a
 
05:04:27.410 --> 05:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
number of years on Civics and try to
 
05:04:30.830 --> 05:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
develop a Civics play in for our schools
 
05:04:32.990 --> 05:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
particularly at the at the secondary
 
05:04:35.510 --> 05:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
level this covers more than just the
 
05:04:38.448 --> 05:04:38.458 align:start position:0%
secondary level it indeed I think it's
 
05:04:40.490 --> 05:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
indicative of what's happening in our
 
05:04:42.970 --> 05:04:42.980 align:start position:0%
country people don't know anything about
 
05:04:45.050 --> 05:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
Civics they don't know anything about
 
05:04:47.030 --> 05:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
government they don't know about the
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
structure they don't know how to
 
05:04:48.240 --> 05:04:49.550 align:start position:0%
structure they don't know how to
participate

05:04:49.550 --> 05:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
participate
 
05:04:52.070 --> 05:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
and as a result we have chaos
 
05:04:54.288 --> 05:04:54.298 align:start position:0%
and they must tell you that that what
 
05:04:56.690 --> 05:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
we're witnessing what I'm witnessing
 
05:04:59.208 --> 05:04:59.218 align:start position:0%
in terms of of the government of our
 
05:05:01.850 --> 05:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
nation the governments around around the
 
05:05:01.860 --> 05:05:02.750 align:start position:0%
nation the governments around around the
world

05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
world
 
05:05:06.650 --> 05:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
is a a totally consistency a chaotic
 
05:05:06.660 --> 05:05:08.330 align:start position:0%
is a a totally consistency a chaotic
situation

05:05:08.330 --> 05:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:05:08.340 --> 05:05:10.730 align:start position:0%
situation
and

05:05:10.730 --> 05:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:15.890 --> 05:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's it's depressing to be uh
 
05:05:18.530 --> 05:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
I taught I've taught Civics I've taught
 
05:05:20.390 --> 05:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
it at Kennett High School at Conway New
 
05:05:22.670 --> 05:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I taught it at Bishop Bradley
 
05:05:24.368 --> 05:05:24.378 align:start position:0%
High School in beatchester New Hampshire
 
05:05:26.750 --> 05:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
taught at New Hampshire college and
 
05:05:29.690 --> 05:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
Franklin Pierce University and of Saint
 
05:05:32.810 --> 05:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
Anselm College so I I I've spent my life
 
05:05:35.868 --> 05:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
trying to inform people about what it is
 
05:05:38.750 --> 05:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
to be a participant
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
and how important your vote is how
 
05:05:44.330 --> 05:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
important your knowledge of the system
 
05:05:46.730 --> 05:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
is how it works how it works and how it
 
05:05:49.310 --> 05:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
functions for you and if you don't
 
05:05:49.320 --> 05:05:50.930 align:start position:0%
functions for you and if you don't
participate

05:05:50.930 --> 05:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
participate
 
05:05:52.910 --> 05:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
you can't complain
 
05:05:55.850 --> 05:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
you just can't complain
 
05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
you've got to be an active participant
 
05:06:00.670 --> 05:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we're pretty good at it
 
05:06:03.050 --> 05:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
particularly in presidential purpose we
 
05:06:05.230 --> 05:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
get the vote out but I'll tell you
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
computable elections are a disgrace
 
05:06:12.708 --> 05:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
we get very few people out a 20 turnout
 
05:06:16.010 --> 05:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes an 18 percent turnout
 
05:06:19.368 --> 05:06:19.378 align:start position:0%
that's that's ridiculous and what do we
 
05:06:22.128 --> 05:06:22.138 align:start position:0%
do we complete we just look at the
 
05:06:24.288 --> 05:06:24.298 align:start position:0%
newspaper listen to people talking of
 
05:06:25.610 --> 05:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
the street and what are they doing
 
05:06:27.530 --> 05:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
they're complaining why are they
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
complain anymore oh this lousy
 
05:06:30.948 --> 05:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
government doesn't work
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
my taxes are too high
 
05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not getting the services that I want
 
05:06:38.208 --> 05:06:38.218 align:start position:0%
well you got to be a player you got to
 
05:06:38.218 --> 05:06:40.070 align:start position:0%
well you got to be a player you got to
participate

05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
participate
 
05:06:42.350 --> 05:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
that you've you've got to be an active
 
05:06:45.650 --> 05:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
participant and hopefully we could do
 
05:06:49.550 --> 05:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
that we could excite uh young people
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
I've got three children I've got they
 
05:06:53.628 --> 05:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
grandchildren I've got two
 
05:06:53.638 --> 05:06:55.250 align:start position:0%
grandchildren I've got two
great-grandchildren

05:06:55.250 --> 05:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
great-grandchildren
 
05:07:00.170 --> 05:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
hopefully somebody in that crew is going
 
05:07:03.410 --> 05:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
to follow follow uh followed by foots
 
05:07:05.570 --> 05:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
episode to speak uh I have a daughter
 
05:07:07.610 --> 05:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
who's very active in politics she's very
 
05:07:09.770 --> 05:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
active around this legislature and I
 
05:07:12.288 --> 05:07:12.298 align:start position:0%
think doing a good job her knowledge of
 
05:07:14.990 --> 05:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
the system is is good in her ability to
 
05:07:17.448 --> 05:07:17.458 align:start position:0%
interact with people is I I think
 
05:07:18.910 --> 05:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
pronounced I have another
 
05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law who's a school nurse I
 
05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
talked to her about her this morning
 
05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
before another piece of legislation and
 
05:07:26.868 --> 05:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
and she's working with kids on a daily
 
05:07:30.050 --> 05:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
basis she's going to help kids out so
 
05:07:32.270 --> 05:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
some of the treatably has has
 
05:07:34.730 --> 05:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
participated and I just hope that we
 
05:07:36.288 --> 05:07:36.298 align:start position:0%
could spread the word
 
05:07:39.230 --> 05:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
just Enlighten people as the young
 
05:07:41.810 --> 05:07:41.820 align:start position:0%
involvement in the process makes a
 
05:07:45.288 --> 05:07:45.298 align:start position:0%
difference you make a difference I uh
 
05:07:48.530 --> 05:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
you all you all have are here and uh uh
 
05:07:50.208 --> 05:07:50.218 align:start position:0%

05:07:51.948 --> 05:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
you make any difference by your
 
05:07:51.958 --> 05:07:53.868 align:start position:0%

participation
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
and your votes are going to be big
 
05:07:58.430 --> 05:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're coming up but you're going to be
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
voting on the budget for the State of
 
05:08:01.810 --> 05:08:01.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hopefully we'll be working
 
05:08:04.010 --> 05:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
on the Senate side
 
05:08:06.050 --> 05:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
but unless we understand the process
 
05:08:08.810 --> 05:08:08.820 align:start position:0%
unless we understand that how meaningful
 
05:08:12.530 --> 05:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
participation is it's all for not
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
so I hope that we'll continue to pursue
 
05:08:18.410 --> 05:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
a good Civics program you know I'd like
 
05:08:21.410 --> 05:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
to see it K-12 obvious obviously because
 
05:08:23.208 --> 05:08:23.218 align:start position:0%
we never stop learning
 
05:08:26.330 --> 05:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
it it indeed the better the better we
 
05:08:29.390 --> 05:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
are acquainted with the facts the better
 
05:08:31.850 --> 05:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
the decision-making process will be in
 
05:08:34.368 --> 05:08:34.378 align:start position:0%
at the better successful have it making
 
05:08:37.070 --> 05:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh our City's better making our talents
 
05:08:38.930 --> 05:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
better and and certainly our state's
 
05:08:40.670 --> 05:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
better and uh we've got to have our
 
05:08:42.170 --> 05:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
influence on the direction of the
 
05:08:43.910 --> 05:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
country so with that Mr chairman I thank
 
05:08:45.470 --> 05:08:45.480 align:start position:0%

05:09:43.128 --> 05:09:43.138 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Elizabeth Jewell I'm the
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
director of education at the New
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Historical Society
 
05:09:50.690 --> 05:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
um we are a supporter of this bill
 
05:09:53.090 --> 05:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
um and we have any good of a story I
 
05:09:54.530 --> 05:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
just want to give a little context to
 
05:09:54.540 --> 05:09:55.250 align:start position:0%
just want to give a little context to
this

05:09:55.250 --> 05:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:09:56.810 --> 05:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Historical Society
 
05:09:58.970 --> 05:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
is one of the oldest non-profits in the
 
05:09:58.980 --> 05:10:00.110 align:start position:0%
is one of the oldest non-profits in the
state

05:10:00.110 --> 05:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:10:01.970 --> 05:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
um we have had a dedicated education
 
05:10:05.810 --> 05:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
program since 1964. we worked with
 
05:10:08.448 --> 05:10:08.458 align:start position:0%
thousands of school kids every year
 
05:10:10.970 --> 05:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
um at the moment our rubric with roughly
 
05:10:13.128 --> 05:10:13.138 align:start position:0%
30 000 school kids in New Hampshire a
 
05:10:13.138 --> 05:10:14.330 align:start position:0%
30 000 school kids in New Hampshire a
year

05:10:14.330 --> 05:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:10:16.128 --> 05:10:16.138 align:start position:0%
um they come through our program through
 
05:10:18.650 --> 05:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
those field trips they certificate in uh
 
05:10:24.368 --> 05:10:24.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:27.050 --> 05:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
for elementary students and they worked
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
with us through that so we have a long
 
05:10:31.430 --> 05:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
history of a lot of kids on which to
 
05:10:33.770 --> 05:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
track Trends and see how things are
 
05:10:36.350 --> 05:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
changing and things are changing really
 
05:10:36.360 --> 05:10:37.610 align:start position:0%
changing and things are changing really
dramatically

05:10:37.610 --> 05:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
05:10:40.070 --> 05:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and about 2015
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
oh sorry about 2015 or 2016 and we
 
05:10:46.730 --> 05:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
started seeing a real change in the
 
05:10:49.070 --> 05:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
students that we were working with their
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
understanding and knowledge of history
 
05:10:53.090 --> 05:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
and Civics just plummeted it happened
 
05:10:56.090 --> 05:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
very quickly it was very dramatic
 
05:10:58.310 --> 05:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
um in response to this our Board of
 
05:11:01.128 --> 05:11:01.138 align:start position:0%
Trustees decided to to dive in with both
 
05:11:02.990 --> 05:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
feet we're very concerned about it we
 
05:11:04.310 --> 05:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
started an initiative called the
 
05:11:07.310 --> 05:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
Democracy project we raised 1.2 million
 
05:11:10.670 --> 05:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
dollars to devote to it and we started
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
really kind of delving into this issue
 
05:11:15.590 --> 05:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
which included a Statewide listening
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
tour with Educators to see what was
 
05:11:20.330 --> 05:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
really going on what we found was that
 
05:11:23.810 --> 05:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
the crisis is really at K-8 a lot of
 
05:11:25.788 --> 05:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
attention is paid to Social Studies and
 
05:11:28.128 --> 05:11:28.138 align:start position:0%
Civics at the high school level but that
 
05:11:30.230 --> 05:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
isn't really where the problem is the
 
05:11:32.990 --> 05:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
problem is at these younger grades and
 
05:11:34.970 --> 05:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
the lack of foundational knowledge that
 
05:11:36.850 --> 05:11:36.860 align:start position:0%
kids are getting and the marginally
 
05:11:39.230 --> 05:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
marginalization of social studies across
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
the board
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
what we found when we talked to teachers
 
05:11:44.448 --> 05:11:44.458 align:start position:0%
and Educators administrators library
 
05:11:47.208 --> 05:11:47.218 align:start position:0%
media Specialists was that especially in
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
K-5 social studies is is not really
 
05:11:52.730 --> 05:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
being taught in the vast majority of New
 
05:11:54.770 --> 05:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire schools anymore
 
05:11:58.128 --> 05:11:58.138 align:start position:0%
um this was back in 2016 2017.
 
05:12:00.410 --> 05:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
um time for social studies had virtually
 
05:12:02.690 --> 05:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
disappeared in their school day with
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
block scheduling all the time was being
 
05:12:06.490 --> 05:12:06.500 align:start position:0%
spent on English language arts and math
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
most schools had a 45-minute block per
 
05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
week that was spent on social studies or
 
05:12:15.948 --> 05:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
science and in practice teachers told us
 
05:12:19.490 --> 05:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
it almost always went to science
 
05:12:22.070 --> 05:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
um so in response to this we like I said
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
we raised the money we did a big
 
05:12:26.270 --> 05:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
initiative to provide curricular
 
05:12:27.890 --> 05:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
resources to provide professional
 
05:12:31.010 --> 05:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
development to be a more active Advocate
 
05:12:33.110 --> 05:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Educators and to work with
 
05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
them and find out what they needed we
 
05:12:38.110 --> 05:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
support this bill in particular because
 
05:12:40.490 --> 05:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
there are two Provisions that are really
 
05:12:42.890 --> 05:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
I think key here the first is we've
 
05:12:45.110 --> 05:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
talked about it a little bit this change
 
05:12:48.230 --> 05:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
in language between social studies or
 
05:12:50.390 --> 05:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
history and Civics education should
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
start no later than eighth grade that
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
actually is some of you have alluded to
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
that actually contradicts what's in the
 
05:12:58.910 --> 05:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
minimum standards right now which says
 
05:13:00.650 --> 05:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
that social studies needs to be taught
 
05:13:03.288 --> 05:13:03.298 align:start position:0%
at every grade level the problem is that
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
for many people RSA 18911 has been
 
05:13:09.470 --> 05:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
revised and looked at so many time in
 
05:13:11.330 --> 05:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
times in recent years that that's kind
 
05:13:13.670 --> 05:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
of become the blueprint that they that
 
05:13:15.350 --> 05:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
Educators look at when they're teaching
 
05:13:17.030 --> 05:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
Social Science Education and so that
 
05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
language is confusing it makes it sound
 
05:13:22.490 --> 05:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
like it's actually
 
05:13:24.890 --> 05:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
um optional before eighth grade when
 
05:13:27.610 --> 05:13:27.620 align:start position:0%
it's not so by clarifying the language
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
you are sending a clear message about
 
05:13:32.690 --> 05:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
the state expectations which have
 
05:13:34.010 --> 05:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
already been set in the minimum
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
standards you're just emphasizing
 
05:13:38.690 --> 05:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
reiterating those expectations
 
05:13:40.970 --> 05:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
the second piece is that middle school
 
05:13:43.550 --> 05:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
that half credit Middle School social or
 
05:13:46.730 --> 05:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
Civics course which again is essential a
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
handful of states in America now require
 
05:13:52.190 --> 05:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
a middle school course of this nature
 
05:13:54.770 --> 05:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should be one of them we
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
should be leading the country as we
 
05:13:59.208 --> 05:13:59.218 align:start position:0%
already do in representative government
 
05:14:00.650 --> 05:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
through town meetings through our
 
05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
citizen legislature through the
 
05:14:04.910 --> 05:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
presidential primary so we should be
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
investing in that because the truth is
 
05:14:09.650 --> 05:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
as as Martha Manson already mentioned by
 
05:14:11.230 --> 05:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
the time those kids get to high school
 
05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
they need to have that basis of
 
05:14:15.650 --> 05:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
foundational knowledge or they're not
 
05:14:16.910 --> 05:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do in high school
 
05:14:20.208 --> 05:14:20.218 align:start position:0%
the things you they need to learn to be
 
05:14:21.530 --> 05:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
able to become fully functioning
 
05:14:21.540 --> 05:14:22.610 align:start position:0%
able to become fully functioning
citizens

05:14:22.610 --> 05:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
05:14:25.610 --> 05:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons we support this
 
05:14:28.550 --> 05:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
we support this bill wholeheartedly as I
 
05:14:30.110 --> 05:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned some of you have asked
 
05:14:31.730 --> 05:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
questions about how do we get people to
 
05:14:33.230 --> 05:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
teach this how do we get it done in the
 
05:14:33.240 --> 05:14:34.310 align:start position:0%
teach this how do we get it done in the
schools

05:14:34.310 --> 05:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:14:36.288 --> 05:14:36.298 align:start position:0%
um I did reference the new Statewide
 
05:14:38.090 --> 05:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
social studies curriculum for upper
 
05:14:39.770 --> 05:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
elementary schools called Moose on the
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
loose it's available online if you go to

taught

05:14:52.670 --> 05:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
taught
 
05:14:56.330 --> 05:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
and it provides that foundational basis
 
05:14:58.190 --> 05:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be all that's taught in
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
social studies other programs other
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
resources are very important to make a
 
05:15:06.230 --> 05:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
really well-rounded education but we've
 
05:15:08.090 --> 05:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
already started with non-profits like
 
05:15:09.708 --> 05:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
mine non-profits like New Hampshire
 
05:15:11.930 --> 05:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
Civics providing the kind of support
 
05:15:14.990 --> 05:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
that schools need we need the state to
 
05:15:17.090 --> 05:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
make a clear statement that you support
 
05:15:21.650 --> 05:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
social studies education at grades K-12
 
05:15:24.230 --> 05:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions from the
 
05:15:24.240 --> 05:15:26.570 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions from the
committee

05:15:26.570 --> 05:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:15:29.208 --> 05:15:29.218 align:start position:0%
do you know if they're teaching in this
 
05:15:31.970 --> 05:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
state I know we did when I was over in
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
Maine that in the fourth grade you all
 
05:15:36.590 --> 05:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
teach Maine history and Civics and
 
05:15:36.600 --> 05:15:37.730 align:start position:0%
teach Maine history and Civics and
government

05:15:37.730 --> 05:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:15:40.250 --> 05:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
is that occurring not Maine but New
 
05:15:42.708 --> 05:15:42.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Civics and because it used to
 
05:15:45.050 --> 05:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
be a fourth grade thing right and it is
 
05:15:47.030 --> 05:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
traditionally that is when State history
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
has been taught and we we usually see
 
05:15:51.470 --> 05:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
fourth graders as you all know right the
 
05:15:52.610 --> 05:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
fourth graders come through here and
 
05:15:54.110 --> 05:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
then they walk across the street and
 
05:15:55.550 --> 05:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
come and see us at the New Hampshire
 
05:15:57.708 --> 05:15:57.718 align:start position:0%
Historical Society we get a lot of field
 
05:15:59.090 --> 05:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
trips still
 
05:16:00.830 --> 05:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
um but what we were seeing more and more
 
05:16:03.170 --> 05:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
was that teachers were telling us
 
05:16:05.390 --> 05:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
instead of that experience being the
 
05:16:07.730 --> 05:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
Capstone to a year-long study of State
 
05:16:10.010 --> 05:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
history it had become the substitute for
 
05:16:12.650 --> 05:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
it and for many of these students that
 
05:16:14.690 --> 05:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
two-hour field trip was all they were
 
05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
getting of State history
 
05:16:18.230 --> 05:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
um social studies has been in Decline
 
05:16:20.930 --> 05:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
for a long time and No Child Left Behind
 
05:16:22.430 --> 05:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
was really The Tipping Point right
 
05:16:24.470 --> 05:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
because the it only emphasized English
 
05:16:27.288 --> 05:16:27.298 align:start position:0%
language arts and math now you're seeing
 
05:16:29.448 --> 05:16:29.458 align:start position:0%
for a while schools try to keep it in I
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
mean educators are just as concerned
 
05:16:33.410 --> 05:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
about this as the rest of us are they
 
05:16:35.570 --> 05:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
tried to keep it in but it's been almost
 
05:16:37.610 --> 05:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
it's been 20 years since that went in
 
05:16:40.430 --> 05:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
and now we have a whole generation of
 
05:16:42.830 --> 05:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
teachers who did not get social studies
 
05:16:45.050 --> 05:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
education when they were in kids when
 
05:16:46.368 --> 05:16:46.378 align:start position:0%
they were in school
 
05:16:49.250 --> 05:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
so it's it's the problem is simply
 
05:16:49.260 --> 05:16:50.868 align:start position:0%
so it's it's the problem is simply
compounding

05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
compounding
 
05:16:52.250 --> 05:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I know I've heard you know some of
 
05:16:55.550 --> 05:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
your questions to to Martha I can sense
 
05:16:57.230 --> 05:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
your frustration that we're not doing
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
more but at the same time it's kind of
 
05:17:00.830 --> 05:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
like that old adage about how do you eat
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
an elephant one bite at a time I mean
 
05:17:05.208 --> 05:17:05.218 align:start position:0%
you got to start somewhere and this is a
 
05:17:06.830 --> 05:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
start something that we thought was
 
05:17:09.050 --> 05:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
achievable that we had consensus around
 
05:17:11.868 --> 05:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
bipartisan consensus that was a step in
 
05:17:13.850 --> 05:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
the right direction there's lots of work
 
05:17:16.250 --> 05:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
still to be done but this is a first
 
05:17:18.170 --> 05:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
step thank you
 
05:17:20.150 --> 05:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:17:22.430 --> 05:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
for the question thank you very much
 
05:17:35.810 --> 05:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon thank you
 
05:17:40.490 --> 05:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
very much for having me
 
05:17:40.500 --> 05:17:41.750 align:start position:0%
very much for having me
um

05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:44.330 --> 05:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
I have uh I wrote my thoughts down so I
 
05:17:45.890 --> 05:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
wouldn't forget anything
 
05:17:48.350 --> 05:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
um dear Representatives my name is Holly
 
05:17:50.690 --> 05:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
Wilson and I am the winner of last
 
05:17:53.150 --> 05:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
year's Mary Susan Leahy New Hampshire
 
05:17:56.208 --> 05:17:56.218 align:start position:0%
Civics teacher of the year
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
8th grade US history and seventh grade
 
05:18:00.830 --> 05:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
civics at Weir Middle School and I've
 
05:18:02.628 --> 05:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
been an educator and Coach most of my
 
05:18:02.638 --> 05:18:03.830 align:start position:0%
been an educator and Coach most of my
life

05:18:03.830 --> 05:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:18:06.110 --> 05:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
I also sit on the New Hampshire Learning
 
05:18:09.410 --> 05:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
Coalition which wrote this bill
 
05:18:11.570 --> 05:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
it continues to shock me that seventh
 
05:18:13.070 --> 05:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
graders do not know the three branches
 
05:18:14.510 --> 05:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
of government when they enter my civics
 
05:18:16.310 --> 05:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
class in the fall
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
it shocks me to hear students Proclaim
 
05:18:20.990 --> 05:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
with utter certainty that the president
 
05:18:22.788 --> 05:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
has more power than anyone else in
 
05:18:22.798 --> 05:18:24.288 align:start position:0%
has more power than anyone else in
government

05:18:24.288 --> 05:18:24.298 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
it pains me to watch jaws drop in
 
05:18:31.490 --> 05:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
astonishment when I teach about lynching
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
students can't believe this has happened
 
05:18:34.970 --> 05:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
in our country
 
05:18:37.030 --> 05:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
they know so little about our government
 
05:18:40.368 --> 05:18:40.378 align:start position:0%
our rights as individuals and our power
 
05:18:45.170 --> 05:18:45.180 align:start position:0%
to change the future why why is this
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
I know why
 
05:18:49.368 --> 05:18:49.378 align:start position:0%
my own children attend a school district
 
05:18:52.070 --> 05:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
that does not dedicate any class to the
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
sole subject of civics until they are
 
05:18:55.730 --> 05:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
sophomores in high school
 
05:18:58.788 --> 05:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
and this is a good school district
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
if they had not heard through
 
05:19:02.090 --> 05:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
conversations at home about the workings
 
05:19:03.650 --> 05:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
of our government
 
05:19:05.750 --> 05:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
if they had not witnessed their parents
 
05:19:07.970 --> 05:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
make the effort to vote
 
05:19:09.948 --> 05:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
if their grandmother had not been a
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
selectman in the town where they lived
 
05:19:14.270 --> 05:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
my children would not have understood
 
05:19:15.830 --> 05:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
how government works until they were
 
05:19:15.840 --> 05:19:17.750 align:start position:0%
how government works until they were
teenagers

05:19:17.750 --> 05:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
teenagers
 
05:19:20.030 --> 05:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's never too soon to help our children
 
05:19:22.070 --> 05:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
our future leaders
 
05:19:24.530 --> 05:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
to recognize and know the workings of
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
our constitution
 
05:19:28.730 --> 05:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
like the national anthem we should teach
 
05:19:31.490 --> 05:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
and reteach Civics year after year
 
05:19:33.948 --> 05:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
we should teach and reteach what our
 
05:19:36.948 --> 05:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
government looks like year after year
 
05:19:39.410 --> 05:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
we should teach and reteach how to
 
05:19:41.208 --> 05:19:41.218 align:start position:0%
become involved
 
05:19:43.730 --> 05:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
specifically within our communities year
 
05:19:45.470 --> 05:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
after year
 
05:19:47.810 --> 05:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
imagine if students were exposed to
 
05:19:50.208 --> 05:19:50.218 align:start position:0%
Civics each year of their education
 
05:19:53.510 --> 05:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
those Snippets of civics remind me of a
 
05:19:55.730 --> 05:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
quote from Desmond Tutu
 
05:19:58.250 --> 05:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
do your little bit of good where you are
 
05:20:01.430 --> 05:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's those little bits of good put
 
05:20:04.430 --> 05:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
together that overwhelm the world
 
05:20:08.090 --> 05:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
please support sb216 more time on Civics
 
05:20:08.100 --> 05:20:09.230 align:start position:0%
please support sb216 more time on Civics
bill

05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
let's expose our youth to Civics from
 
05:20:13.610 --> 05:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
grades K-12 and produce the next
 
05:20:18.170 --> 05:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:20.208 --> 05:20:20.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
05:20:23.890 --> 05:20:23.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:27.470 --> 05:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
as Civics teacher of the year do you
 
05:20:29.030 --> 05:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
know of a curriculum that's out there
 
05:20:30.590 --> 05:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's been written for elementary
 
05:20:30.600 --> 05:20:33.190 align:start position:0%
that's been written for elementary
schools

05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:20:35.810 --> 05:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
specifically for civics
 
05:20:39.470 --> 05:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
well for for even social studies you
 
05:20:41.270 --> 05:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
know you know it used to be a
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
requirement you had X number of minutes
 
05:20:45.770 --> 05:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
per week taught in this subject area we
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
took that stuff out all over the country
 
05:20:49.850 --> 05:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
and now we're sitting there as you say
 
05:20:51.530 --> 05:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
because we don't measure in a Statewide
 
05:20:53.690 --> 05:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
assessment I'm not held accountable for
 
05:20:57.230 --> 05:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
a social studies so why teach it well I
 
05:20:59.208 --> 05:20:59.218 align:start position:0%
can speak from what I see where I teach
 
05:21:01.730 --> 05:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
and it is a it's a tremendous School
 
05:21:04.368 --> 05:21:04.378 align:start position:0%
District I'm very proud of it but when
 
05:21:05.810 --> 05:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
we have vertical meetings where all of
 
05:21:08.448 --> 05:21:08.458 align:start position:0%
the social studies teachers come grades
 
05:21:10.628 --> 05:21:10.638 align:start position:0%
four through eight in my school
 
05:21:13.128 --> 05:21:13.138 align:start position:0%
the social studies Department in the
 
05:21:15.350 --> 05:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
fourth grade doesn't know where to
 
05:21:17.288 --> 05:21:17.298 align:start position:0%
acquire information there isn't
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
specifically things for them to utilize
 
05:21:23.930 --> 05:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
we piecemeal together the New Hampshire
 
05:21:25.970 --> 05:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
Council for social studies wants to be
 
05:21:28.250 --> 05:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
an integral part of this bill in
 
05:21:30.050 --> 05:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
providing professional development that
 
05:21:32.750 --> 05:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
is the committee I'm sitting on we know
 
05:21:34.550 --> 05:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
about the moose on the loose which is is
 
05:21:36.770 --> 05:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
a wonderful program and teachers are
 
05:21:38.810 --> 05:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
very good at doing research and finding
 
05:21:40.550 --> 05:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
things that work for their students But
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
to answer your questions specifically I
 
05:21:45.708 --> 05:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
do not know of something that is
 
05:21:49.610 --> 05:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
specific in my district for Gades k-4
 
05:21:51.650 --> 05:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
we used to have
 
05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
various Powers Holton methlin Holt
 
05:21:55.850 --> 05:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
Reinhardt Winston Scott forestman all
 
05:21:58.970 --> 05:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
those that had programs specifically
 
05:22:02.270 --> 05:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
built around social studies K through
 
05:22:02.280 --> 05:22:04.850 align:start position:0%
built around social studies K through
12.

05:22:04.850 --> 05:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
12.
 
05:22:07.310 --> 05:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
um have has that all disappeared well
 
05:22:10.490 --> 05:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
our district has very specific what you
 
05:22:13.010 --> 05:22:13.020 align:start position:0%
need to teach when but if you're asking
 
05:22:16.250 --> 05:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
me where do we get that curriculum
 
05:22:19.310 --> 05:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
you have creative teachers who teach too
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
we are competency-based district and we
 
05:22:23.868 --> 05:22:23.878 align:start position:0%
know our competency what the kids have
 
05:22:25.910 --> 05:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
to master and so we use the for the
 
05:22:28.190 --> 05:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
resources that we can to teach to the
 
05:22:28.200 --> 05:22:29.868 align:start position:0%
resources that we can to teach to the
competency

05:22:29.868 --> 05:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
competency
 
05:22:31.128 --> 05:22:31.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:32.570 --> 05:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
rep Santana
 
05:22:35.030 --> 05:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to congratulate you
 
05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
on thank you my the greatest honor of my
 
05:22:38.638 --> 05:22:39.530 align:start position:0%
on thank you my the greatest honor of my
life

05:22:39.530 --> 05:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:22:41.930 --> 05:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
super I'm sure I'm sure you would really
 
05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
deserved it because it's been hard
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
teaching social studies the last few
 
05:22:45.360 --> 05:22:46.730 align:start position:0%
teaching social studies the last few
years

05:22:46.730 --> 05:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:22:50.090 --> 05:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if if you use
 
05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
Performance Based assessments if you do
 
05:22:56.510 --> 05:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
activities rather than just sit and and
 
05:22:58.910 --> 05:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
learn uh you know the different the
 
05:23:00.830 --> 05:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence and that
 
05:23:01.970 --> 05:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
sort of thing and if you could share
 
05:23:04.190 --> 05:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
with us maybe a couple of things that
 
05:23:06.470 --> 05:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
you do you would suggest in the Middle
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
School area for activities thanks
 
05:23:10.440 --> 05:23:11.170 align:start position:0%
School area for activities thanks
um

05:23:11.170 --> 05:23:11.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
we are I have not given a traditional
 
05:23:16.730 --> 05:23:16.740 align:start position:0%
test in seven years we are performance
 
05:23:21.050 --> 05:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
task we call all of our summatives tests
 
05:23:23.330 --> 05:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
um for old school where we call them
 
05:23:24.890 --> 05:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
summatives now we call them performance
 
05:23:27.230 --> 05:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
tasks they all revolve around something
 
05:23:31.190 --> 05:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's realistic kids need to show their
 
05:23:33.368 --> 05:23:33.378 align:start position:0%
knowledge through a project of some kind
 
05:23:36.170 --> 05:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
and I understand what Martha was saying
 
05:23:39.590 --> 05:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
about the the um naturalization exam is
 
05:23:42.948 --> 05:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh much more um
 
05:23:44.990 --> 05:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's just simple questions do you know
 
05:23:46.368 --> 05:23:46.378 align:start position:0%
the facts can you answer the question
 
05:23:49.190 --> 05:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
the way I assess my students is can you
 
05:23:51.230 --> 05:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
take that information and you can can
 
05:23:53.330 --> 05:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
you tell me how that works and you can
 
05:23:54.948 --> 05:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
can you tell me the impact that has on
 
05:23:57.288 --> 05:23:57.298 align:start position:0%
us today that's the highest score that
 
05:23:59.868 --> 05:23:59.878 align:start position:0%
they can get it's not easy for them to
 
05:24:01.610 --> 05:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
understand a lot of things
 
05:24:03.708 --> 05:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
at that level in seventh and eighth
 
05:24:06.830 --> 05:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
grade but they can they can and I assess
 
05:24:10.368 --> 05:24:10.378 align:start position:0%
using fun things create a podcast and
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
answer these series of questions that
 
05:24:16.128 --> 05:24:16.138 align:start position:0%
answer a series of depth of knowledge
 
05:24:19.430 --> 05:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
um ranking from one to four one is one
 
05:24:21.890 --> 05:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
number you know do you know what that is
 
05:24:23.990 --> 05:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
do you know my name you just remember it
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
right all the way to four what is the
 
05:24:28.670 --> 05:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
impact so I they create podcasts they
 
05:24:31.190 --> 05:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
know how to build websites
 
05:24:32.990 --> 05:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
um we sometimes do old-fashioned
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
newspapers how about a letter to the
 
05:24:34.798 --> 05:24:35.990 align:start position:0%
newspapers how about a letter to the
editor

05:24:35.990 --> 05:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
editor
 
05:24:39.350 --> 05:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
um kids don't really know what that is
 
05:24:39.360 --> 05:24:40.390 align:start position:0%
um kids don't really know what that is
um

05:24:40.390 --> 05:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:42.770 --> 05:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
Elka she's here in the background she's
 
05:24:44.030 --> 05:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
one of my students what other things
 
05:24:45.288 --> 05:24:45.298 align:start position:0%
have we done
 
05:24:45.298 --> 05:24:47.150 align:start position:0%
have we done
posters

05:24:47.150 --> 05:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
posters
 
05:24:52.670 --> 05:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes representative
 
05:24:54.718 --> 05:24:56.690 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes representative
Damon

05:24:56.690 --> 05:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
05:24:58.570 --> 05:24:58.580 align:start position:0%
when thank you for taking my question
 
05:25:01.250 --> 05:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
when are you going to publish the
 
05:25:03.948 --> 05:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
curriculum you just described and can we
 
05:25:06.830 --> 05:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
sit in on your class
 
05:25:09.110 --> 05:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
I will tell you what the professional
 
05:25:10.670 --> 05:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
development that New Hampshire Civics
 
05:25:13.250 --> 05:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
has offered me and my colleagues that's
 
05:25:15.590 --> 05:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
just one organization in this state is
 
05:25:17.628 --> 05:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
outstanding I just had a great Zoom
 
05:25:19.550 --> 05:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
professional development yesterday with
 
05:25:20.990 --> 05:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
a social studies teacher in Milford
 
05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
who's an Adjunct professor at UNH
 
05:25:25.310 --> 05:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
talking about how do we teach democracy
 
05:25:29.390 --> 05:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
in classrooms that are so polarized and
 
05:25:33.288 --> 05:25:33.298 align:start position:0%
he gives concrete ideas and we feel like
 
05:25:36.410 --> 05:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
we're politicians as teachers we need to
 
05:25:39.470 --> 05:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
cross the aisle we need to I I don't
 
05:25:42.110 --> 05:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
have an agenda to tell my students what
 
05:25:46.128 --> 05:25:46.138 align:start position:0%
my politics are I want them to learn to
 
05:25:48.650 --> 05:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
critically think and so we have to do
 
05:25:50.750 --> 05:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing and yeah it would be
 
05:25:51.948 --> 05:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
great if we could publish this
 
05:25:53.810 --> 05:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
curriculum all in one place wouldn't it
 
05:25:55.250 --> 05:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
be fun maybe I should write a book when
 
05:25:57.288 --> 05:25:57.298 align:start position:0%
I retire but
 
05:25:59.628 --> 05:25:59.638 align:start position:0%
we get ideas from lots of different
 
05:26:02.150 --> 05:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
places and this Coalition plans on
 
05:26:03.530 --> 05:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
following through my committee
 
05:26:05.990 --> 05:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
individually as a small group wants to
 
05:26:08.868 --> 05:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
be engaged in that where will teachers
 
05:26:10.670 --> 05:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
go once they're told they need to do
 
05:26:12.650 --> 05:26:12.660 align:start position:0%
this to get information we are going to
 
05:26:13.788 --> 05:26:13.798 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
05:26:15.230 --> 05:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
on the New Hampshire Council for social
 
05:26:17.330 --> 05:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
studies is one of the largest proponents
 
05:26:19.310 --> 05:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
that's an easy place to go to get free
 
05:26:21.650 --> 05:26:21.660 align:start position:0%
information about how to teach something
 
05:26:23.868 --> 05:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
here's an idea here's a lesson plan
 
05:26:25.250 --> 05:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to do any work it's
 
05:26:27.410 --> 05:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
just right there
 
05:26:29.150 --> 05:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
repson cordelli
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for being here
 
05:26:32.510 --> 05:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
and congratulations
 
05:26:35.690 --> 05:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you back in 2016. well I guess
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
goes to the question of
 
05:26:39.230 --> 05:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
um how do we know what is actually being
 
05:26:41.150 --> 05:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
taught or if things are actually being
 
05:26:45.470 --> 05:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
taught back in 2016 we passed a statute
 
05:26:47.868 --> 05:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
that said the history of the Pledge of
 
05:26:50.090 --> 05:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
Allegiance and Star-Spangled Banner
 
05:26:52.190 --> 05:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
should be taught do you know if that's
 
05:26:56.030 --> 05:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:58.490 --> 05:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh it is being taught
 
05:26:58.500 --> 05:26:59.470 align:start position:0%
uh it is being taught
um

05:26:59.470 --> 05:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:03.070 --> 05:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
specifically I can speak to my district
 
05:27:07.430 --> 05:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have such specific
 
05:27:07.440 --> 05:27:08.090 align:start position:0%
we don't have such specific
um

05:27:08.090 --> 05:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:09.948 --> 05:27:09.958 align:start position:0%
we have learning targets underneath our
 
05:27:11.628 --> 05:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
competencies which last year we just
 
05:27:13.190 --> 05:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
narrowed down
 
05:27:16.550 --> 05:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
Ela had 56 learning targets science had
 
05:27:19.490 --> 05:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
128 and it was almost impossible to
 
05:27:21.288 --> 05:27:21.298 align:start position:0%
reach them all
 
05:27:21.298 --> 05:27:23.270 align:start position:0%
reach them all
um

05:27:23.270 --> 05:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:25.730 --> 05:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
but we try our very best we understand
 
05:27:28.430 --> 05:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
what we need to teach but
 
05:27:30.890 --> 05:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
is it actually for me specifically
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
stated no I need to teach that they
 
05:27:36.050 --> 05:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
understand government that's pretty
 
05:27:38.270 --> 05:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
vague and that gives me a wonderful
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
platform from which to jump
 
05:27:42.890 --> 05:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:27:44.690 --> 05:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
no further questions thank you very much
 
05:27:45.948 --> 05:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:27:57.730 --> 05:27:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:00.050 --> 05:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon for the record
 
05:28:01.750 --> 05:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
Megan Tuttle president of New Hampshire
 
05:28:03.770 --> 05:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
I will keep this short because I know
 
05:28:05.150 --> 05:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
there's a long list it's late there's
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
still more bills and I don't know how I
 
05:28:08.390 --> 05:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
can follow that
 
05:28:10.670 --> 05:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
um so I just I have written remarks and
 
05:28:12.288 --> 05:28:12.298 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn them in I'm completely
 
05:28:13.850 --> 05:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
going different though listening to
 
05:28:15.288 --> 05:28:15.298 align:start position:0%
what's been said I was a social studies
 
05:28:16.970 --> 05:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
teacher for 18 years eighth grade social
 
05:28:19.970 --> 05:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
studies U.S history from Colonial times
 
05:28:21.770 --> 05:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
through reconstruction so everything
 
05:28:25.128 --> 05:28:25.138 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is what I did for 18
 
05:28:25.138 --> 05:28:26.270 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is what I did for 18
years

05:28:26.270 --> 05:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
I guess what I really just want to say
 
05:28:29.448 --> 05:28:29.458 align:start position:0%
here um
 
05:28:31.490 --> 05:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
I have three boys I've mentioned that
 
05:28:33.470 --> 05:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
before they're in public school they're
 
05:28:35.570 --> 05:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
currently fourth Sixth and tenth grade
 
05:28:38.570 --> 05:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
when my 10th grader was in fourth grade
 
05:28:40.550 --> 05:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I had my eighth
 
05:28:44.030 --> 05:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
graders do was we taught um they learned
 
05:28:45.948 --> 05:28:45.958 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire history through me
 
05:28:47.690 --> 05:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
so that they could come into my son's
 
05:28:50.448 --> 05:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
fourth grade class and teach them about
 
05:28:53.090 --> 05:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire history and government in
 
05:28:54.650 --> 05:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
preparation for the State House Tour
 
05:28:56.510 --> 05:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
that they were going to take that year
 
05:28:58.850 --> 05:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
so when you asked about assessments
 
05:29:01.070 --> 05:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
things like that that's something that
 
05:29:04.128 --> 05:29:04.138 align:start position:0%
one thing that I did as a project I knew
 
05:29:07.010 --> 05:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
my eighth graders knew the material
 
05:29:08.930 --> 05:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
because they taught it to somebody else
 
05:29:11.510 --> 05:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
and they taught it to other kids and so
 
05:29:13.368 --> 05:29:13.378 align:start position:0%
that's one way that we knew it was
 
05:29:13.378 --> 05:29:14.690 align:start position:0%
that's one way that we knew it was
happening

05:29:14.690 --> 05:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
happening
 
05:29:14.700 --> 05:29:15.890 align:start position:0%
happening
um

05:29:15.890 --> 05:29:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
we also did a lot with differentiated
 
05:29:19.850 --> 05:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
learning and I did a lot with it was
 
05:29:22.070 --> 05:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
kind of an upside or a triangle where
 
05:29:24.890 --> 05:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
the sea level was where the kids got the
 
05:29:27.670 --> 05:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
basic knowledge they would learn
 
05:29:30.410 --> 05:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
vocabulary just basic information in
 
05:29:32.628 --> 05:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
ways that fit their learning style so we
 
05:29:34.190 --> 05:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
had a calendar they could pick their you
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
know the way they wanted to learn it
 
05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
they gained points the B level was
 
05:29:40.128 --> 05:29:40.138 align:start position:0%
smaller but that's where they applied
 
05:29:42.050 --> 05:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
the knowledge and then the a level the
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
top of it is where they answer the
 
05:29:45.170 --> 05:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
answer the essential question for the
 
05:29:45.180 --> 05:29:45.890 align:start position:0%
answer the essential question for the
unit

05:29:45.890 --> 05:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
unit
 
05:29:48.170 --> 05:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ways that we can assess
 
05:29:50.810 --> 05:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
them without doing a state test and it
 
05:29:52.970 --> 05:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
works because there was no written test
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
for this it was all through can they
 
05:29:57.770 --> 05:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
talk to me and so we had conversations
 
05:29:59.930 --> 05:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
if they can explain things to me I know
 
05:30:01.250 --> 05:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
they're not just memorizing I know
 
05:30:02.690 --> 05:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
they're not just spitting you know back
 
05:30:04.250 --> 05:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
information that they read from a book
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
or you know learned from flashcards or
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
whatever so there's lots of different
 
05:30:09.050 --> 05:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
ways to do this
 
05:30:11.690 --> 05:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
I think the big thing here is we need it
 
05:30:13.670 --> 05:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
back in the classroom we need Civics
 
05:30:15.530 --> 05:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
back in the classroom in all the grade
 
05:30:17.750 --> 05:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
levels it was easy to Let It Go when No
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
Child Left Behind came around because
 
05:30:21.948 --> 05:30:21.958 align:start position:0%
the importance was put on English math
 
05:30:23.628 --> 05:30:23.638 align:start position:0%
reading we've been through all this so I
 
05:30:25.670 --> 05:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to rehash it but that's what
 
05:30:27.170 --> 05:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
happened we need to get it back into the
 
05:30:28.970 --> 05:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
classroom this bill is going to allow
 
05:30:30.890 --> 05:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
that to happen the Civics Coalition
 
05:30:32.510 --> 05:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
working with Martha working with
 
05:30:34.670 --> 05:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth working with everybody is
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
amazing and so I will pass in my written
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
testimony but you know as an eighth
 
05:30:41.628 --> 05:30:41.638 align:start position:0%
grade social studies teacher we need it
 
05:30:42.830 --> 05:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
back in the classroom kids were coming
 
05:30:45.050 --> 05:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
to me not knowing everything that was
 
05:30:47.150 --> 05:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
just spoke about and that's awful for
 
05:30:49.070 --> 05:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
the future and I really just honestly
 
05:30:52.430 --> 05:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
want all kids to get what my kids get
 
05:30:55.070 --> 05:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
which they don't appreciate yet but when
 
05:30:56.690 --> 05:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
they're a captive audience in the card
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
and they will someday hopefully the
 
05:31:00.650 --> 05:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
captive audience in the car 10 minutes
 
05:31:02.090 --> 05:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
they're getting you know U.S history
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
they're getting labor history
 
05:31:05.090 --> 05:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because of my job they're
 
05:31:06.288 --> 05:31:06.298 align:start position:0%
getting Union history they're getting
 
05:31:07.610 --> 05:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
all that but they're getting that
 
05:31:08.990 --> 05:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
because they're stuck in the car with me
 
05:31:12.350 --> 05:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
me every child should have that right so
 
05:31:14.570 --> 05:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that thank you very
 
05:31:16.368 --> 05:31:16.378 align:start position:0%
much Megan are there any questions from
 
05:31:18.230 --> 05:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
the committee yes representative luno
 
05:31:20.390 --> 05:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thanks
 
05:31:23.868 --> 05:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
Megan for joining us and um you know I I
 
05:31:23.878 --> 05:31:25.390 align:start position:0%
Megan for joining us and um you know I I
um

05:31:25.390 --> 05:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:27.650 --> 05:31:27.660 align:start position:0%
a question I'd sort of like to get out
 
05:31:30.288 --> 05:31:30.298 align:start position:0%
with you and I don't know if if the
 
05:31:33.590 --> 05:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
chair would would allow Holly Wilson to
 
05:31:35.690 --> 05:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
to join you up here but it was something
 
05:31:38.208 --> 05:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
based on what she said but they're both
 
05:31:40.610 --> 05:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
teachers here so all right Holly where
 
05:31:44.990 --> 05:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
are you oh but Holly made Holly made a
 
05:31:46.970 --> 05:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
fantastic comment and I think you you
 
05:31:50.330 --> 05:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
touched on it as well Megan which the um
 
05:31:54.288 --> 05:31:54.298 align:start position:0%
the a lot of the directives that that we
 
05:31:56.510 --> 05:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
have in statute and you use the term
 
05:31:59.090 --> 05:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
vague and I like that but it gives you a
 
05:32:02.390 --> 05:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
large platform for which to to jump and
 
05:32:04.970 --> 05:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
I I took that correctly if I'm wrong as
 
05:32:06.708 --> 05:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
being a positive
 
05:32:08.628 --> 05:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
um thing as opposed to something so
 
05:32:11.890 --> 05:32:11.900 align:start position:0%
granular like like you've got to teach
 
05:32:15.410 --> 05:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
how some you know the history of this
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
specific thing or that specific thing
 
05:32:21.530 --> 05:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
and and so you know just in the last
 
05:32:24.410 --> 05:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
just in the last week or so you know we
 
05:32:27.770 --> 05:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
passed bills requiring teachers to teach
 
05:32:30.230 --> 05:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
cursive instruction great I don't know
 
05:32:33.110 --> 05:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
what five or something like that or or
 
05:32:34.850 --> 05:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
multiple you know memorizing
 
05:32:37.730 --> 05:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
multiplication tables as opposed to we
 
05:32:39.850 --> 05:32:39.860 align:start position:0%
want our students to learn intuitive
 
05:32:42.650 --> 05:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
strategies to understand math you know
 
05:32:45.050 --> 05:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
things like like that but bringing it
 
05:32:48.170 --> 05:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
back to 216 are the are the directives
 
05:32:48.180 --> 05:32:50.208 align:start position:0%
back to 216 are the are the directives
here

05:32:50.208 --> 05:32:50.218 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:32:50.218 --> 05:32:50.890 align:start position:0%
here
um

05:32:50.890 --> 05:32:50.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:52.670 --> 05:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:32:55.010 --> 05:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
that are sort of on the bottom of of of
 
05:32:57.830 --> 05:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
the first page of the bill would you
 
05:32:59.750 --> 05:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
consider those
 
05:33:01.490 --> 05:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
um in your sort of professional
 
05:33:04.490 --> 05:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
experience to be sufficiently broad or
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
vague in order to provide you with that
 
05:33:10.190 --> 05:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
with that large platform with to to
 
05:33:12.770 --> 05:33:12.780 align:start position:0%
reach your students
 
05:33:14.448 --> 05:33:14.458 align:start position:0%
I think so
 
05:33:17.208 --> 05:33:17.218 align:start position:0%
um I I like that we've suggested such as
 
05:33:19.850 --> 05:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
and I really like what uh Senator
 
05:33:22.430 --> 05:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative Damon said about adding
 
05:33:25.970 --> 05:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
more current uh beyond the 60s and it's
 
05:33:28.430 --> 05:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
a goal that uh
 
05:33:31.910 --> 05:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
yes I I think that it is
 
05:33:34.730 --> 05:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
there is enough room for teachers to
 
05:33:36.890 --> 05:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
bring their their own talents to the
 
05:33:38.750 --> 05:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
show and
 
05:33:41.090 --> 05:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
choose the best way to teach certain
 
05:33:43.010 --> 05:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
things and maybe combine some of these
 
05:33:43.020 --> 05:33:44.990 align:start position:0%
things and maybe combine some of these
subjects

05:33:44.990 --> 05:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
subjects
 
05:33:47.150 --> 05:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and maybe skip one because they run
 
05:33:48.470 --> 05:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
out of time they'd like to get to
 
05:33:51.350 --> 05:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
January 6 2021 before they're going to
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
talk about Federalist Papers kind of
 
05:33:55.490 --> 05:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
thing sure sure great thank you very
 
05:33:57.470 --> 05:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
much Holly and thank you I was just
 
05:33:59.090 --> 05:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
going to say I agree with you know it
 
05:34:01.490 --> 05:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
says such as and this gives kind of what
 
05:34:03.170 --> 05:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
could be taught but gives you the
 
05:34:06.050 --> 05:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
openness to bring other things in
 
05:34:07.910 --> 05:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
great thank
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for Ms Tuttle
 
05:34:17.270 --> 05:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:20.090 --> 05:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
come back I can go sit down at you she's
 
05:34:22.490 --> 05:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
in the classroom right now still so
 
05:34:24.230 --> 05:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
um just because you are representative
 
05:34:28.190 --> 05:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
of the teachers in in the field it has
 
05:34:32.030 --> 05:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
been my concern about the number of
 
05:34:35.990 --> 05:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
um legislative curricular items so keep
 
05:34:38.208 --> 05:34:38.218 align:start position:0%
getting passed down to districts versus
 
05:34:40.610 --> 05:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
allowing local school districts to make
 
05:34:43.010 --> 05:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
those decisions I believe in cursive
 
05:34:44.930 --> 05:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
handwriting absolutely but it went away
 
05:34:47.150 --> 05:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
and why is it because something else
 
05:34:49.250 --> 05:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
took its place I mean I know our
 
05:34:51.110 --> 05:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
teachers are inundated today between
 
05:34:53.330 --> 05:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
technology and whatever else is added
 
05:34:57.050 --> 05:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
are you hearing in the field that adding
 
05:34:57.060 --> 05:34:58.128 align:start position:0%
are you hearing in the field that adding
civics

05:34:58.128 --> 05:34:58.138 align:start position:0%
civics
 
05:35:00.350 --> 05:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
I mean are people saying well when are
 
05:35:02.208 --> 05:35:02.218 align:start position:0%
we going to do it I mean we still have a
 
05:35:04.610 --> 05:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
five and a quarter hour day or two or
 
05:35:07.788 --> 05:35:07.798 align:start position:0%
six hour day depending on the levels
 
05:35:07.798 --> 05:35:08.930 align:start position:0%
six hour day depending on the levels
um

05:35:08.930 --> 05:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:11.628 --> 05:35:11.638 align:start position:0%
I think Civics should have never gone
 
05:35:15.170 --> 05:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
away but I can remember in the 2016 era
 
05:35:17.390 --> 05:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
when Common Core came out
 
05:35:19.730 --> 05:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
it's we we made a decision not to buy
 
05:35:22.670 --> 05:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
any more textbook series because you had
 
05:35:24.170 --> 05:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
to cut the budget anyway we'll get
 
05:35:26.930 --> 05:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
enough money but also integrating it
 
05:35:28.850 --> 05:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
with language arts and reading so that
 
05:35:31.070 --> 05:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
you hit the topics at the same time as
 
05:35:33.050 --> 05:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
you're teaching reading obviously that
 
05:35:34.550 --> 05:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
did not work because you weren't
 
05:35:37.310 --> 05:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
spending enough time on content of
 
05:35:37.320 --> 05:35:38.390 align:start position:0%
spending enough time on content of
civics

05:35:38.390 --> 05:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
civics
 
05:35:40.730 --> 05:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
and I just wonder if teachers in the
 
05:35:43.070 --> 05:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
field have expressed that to you because
 
05:35:45.288 --> 05:35:45.298 align:start position:0%
it is a huge concern of mine and I think
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
other things need to go and Civics needs
 
05:35:50.448 --> 05:35:50.458 align:start position:0%
to be there without a doubt and I thank
 
05:35:52.910 --> 05:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
you for the question what I'm hearing is
 
05:35:54.670 --> 05:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
Elementary it's always going to be hard
 
05:35:56.990 --> 05:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
to put something back in that's been
 
05:35:58.970 --> 05:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
taken out because
 
05:36:02.390 --> 05:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
the focus has been on math reading and
 
05:36:04.730 --> 05:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
writing for so long I don't think it's
 
05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
impossible I think it can definitely be
 
05:36:08.868 --> 05:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
done we just need to help the elementary
 
05:36:11.570 --> 05:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
school teachers figure out how to you
 
05:36:13.330 --> 05:36:13.340 align:start position:0%
know get Civics back in the classroom
 
05:36:15.230 --> 05:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
Middle School
 
05:36:17.150 --> 05:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
8th grade seventh grade sixth grade
 
05:36:19.550 --> 05:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
right we have specialized subjects so
 
05:36:21.530 --> 05:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier and from what I am
 
05:36:23.090 --> 05:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
hearing especially middle school high
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
school it would be nice to have
 
05:36:26.930 --> 05:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
something to point to to say guess what
 
05:36:28.550 --> 05:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
we we do need to do this it's important
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
right and I think that this will also
 
05:36:31.730 --> 05:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
help the elementary school teachers who
 
05:36:33.230 --> 05:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
are kind of saying okay but we have to
 
05:36:34.670 --> 05:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
focus on this this and this because of
 
05:36:36.530 --> 05:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
the test this is going to be something
 
05:36:38.690 --> 05:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
to point to them now two different hats
 
05:36:41.448 --> 05:36:41.458 align:start position:0%
to wear on curriculum mandates coming
 
05:36:42.890 --> 05:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
down from the state I have my teacher
 
05:36:45.230 --> 05:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
hat I have my you know Nea New Hampshire
 
05:36:45.240 --> 05:36:46.430 align:start position:0%
hat I have my you know Nea New Hampshire
hat

05:36:46.430 --> 05:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
hat
 
05:36:46.440 --> 05:36:49.128 align:start position:0%
hat
um

05:36:49.128 --> 05:36:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:52.670 --> 05:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
it would this the way this is written is
 
05:36:55.250 --> 05:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
good because it gives Direction but it
 
05:36:57.650 --> 05:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify you have to for example
 
05:36:59.090 --> 05:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
like you were mentioning memorize
 
05:37:01.368 --> 05:37:01.378 align:start position:0%
multiplication right teach it not
 
05:37:03.590 --> 05:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
memorize it right so you know giving
 
05:37:05.150 --> 05:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
some Direction
 
05:37:07.850 --> 05:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
but having it in statute that the
 
05:37:09.288 --> 05:37:09.298 align:start position:0%
directions there which I know it's in
 
05:37:11.330 --> 05:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
there but this is just moving it forward
 
05:37:13.070 --> 05:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense just want to make
 
05:37:14.690 --> 05:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
sure the perception from the teacher's
 
05:37:17.270 --> 05:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
point of view is we can do this from
 
05:37:18.530 --> 05:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing yes but I'll definitely
 
05:37:19.850 --> 05:37:19.860 align:start position:0%
someone who's in the classroom is home
 
05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:37:23.208 --> 05:37:23.218 align:start position:0%
um I think if teachers understand that
 
05:37:25.250 --> 05:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
they need to touch on Civics during
 
05:37:27.050 --> 05:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
these grades they can integrate it and
 
05:37:28.670 --> 05:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a classic example I was
 
05:37:29.990 --> 05:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
teaching US History not long ago
 
05:37:31.970 --> 05:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
teaching about World War II Japanese
 
05:37:34.730 --> 05:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
internment camps the Holocaust and boy
 
05:37:36.470 --> 05:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
that Japanese internment camp turned
 
05:37:37.970 --> 05:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
right into
 
05:37:40.010 --> 05:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
what about our first 10 amendments what
 
05:37:41.390 --> 05:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
about the rights of those people they
 
05:37:43.128 --> 05:37:43.138 align:start position:0%
can just go and take their houses they
 
05:37:45.770 --> 05:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
can take their they can do this
 
05:37:48.948 --> 05:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
and there's Civics right there I stopped
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
the the lesson and we just went in that
 
05:37:53.570 --> 05:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
direction because they had already had a
 
05:37:55.128 --> 05:37:55.138 align:start position:0%
stomach so they did know generally how
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
our government worked but it's like how
 
05:37:58.730 --> 05:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
did they get away with that so teachers
 
05:38:00.350 --> 05:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
can do that if they're creative but if
 
05:38:02.448 --> 05:38:02.458 align:start position:0%
they know they have to it's much easier
 
05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
to integrate it into what you're already
 
05:38:07.010 --> 05:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
teaching I think
 
05:38:09.410 --> 05:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
before you leave ladies I have a sort of
 
05:38:11.390 --> 05:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
a follow-up here
 
05:38:13.610 --> 05:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
um I hate the dragons but I
 
05:38:16.610 --> 05:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
we we have elementary teachers they're
 
05:38:18.350 --> 05:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
going to post-secondary education and
 
05:38:21.410 --> 05:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
getting their tickets to be a teacher
 
05:38:24.170 --> 05:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
and you might get a methods course in
 
05:38:26.868 --> 05:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
how to teach social studies
 
05:38:29.570 --> 05:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have anything else
 
05:38:32.090 --> 05:38:32.100 align:start position:0%
unless you've taken a gen Ed Course your
 
05:38:34.970 --> 05:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
general education that's more your
 
05:38:38.090 --> 05:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
liking my concern are are these
 
05:38:40.850 --> 05:38:40.860 align:start position:0%
elementary teachers that have come out
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
of this situation of the classes since
 
05:38:47.270 --> 05:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
we've talked about 2016 it's kind of
 
05:38:50.208 --> 05:38:50.218 align:start position:0%
been a divorce avoid of a subject are
 
05:38:51.650 --> 05:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
they coming in with a knowledge and
 
05:38:53.330 --> 05:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is something we
 
05:38:56.090 --> 05:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
should be teaching are they being told
 
05:38:59.628 --> 05:38:59.638 align:start position:0%
that at this post-secondary level
 
05:39:01.368 --> 05:39:01.378 align:start position:0%
um how is it being taught there and I
 
05:39:03.410 --> 05:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
see some some that are shaking their
 
05:39:05.690 --> 05:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
heads like this and and
 
05:39:08.090 --> 05:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm really concerned there's nobody
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
here from our post-secondary systems
 
05:39:13.128 --> 05:39:13.138 align:start position:0%
nobody in this crowd and they never
 
05:39:15.410 --> 05:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
attend unless there's something directly
 
05:39:16.850 --> 05:39:16.860 align:start position:0%
affecting freedom of speech in the
 
05:39:18.350 --> 05:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
college campus
 
05:39:22.550 --> 05:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
so I I am concerned that we really you
 
05:39:24.288 --> 05:39:24.298 align:start position:0%
know try to get in to find out the
 
05:39:27.350 --> 05:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
reasons why it's not being taught
 
05:39:29.628 --> 05:39:29.638 align:start position:0%
the way that I think we all feel it
 
05:39:31.270 --> 05:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:39:33.530 --> 05:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I completely agree with that
 
05:39:34.970 --> 05:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
and I've testified before in other
 
05:39:36.590 --> 05:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
things in the past few years that
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
pre-service is just as important the
 
05:39:39.830 --> 05:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
pre-service programs are just as
 
05:39:41.090 --> 05:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
important when we talked about suicide
 
05:39:43.490 --> 05:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
prevention and you know having to do the
 
05:39:45.350 --> 05:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
trainings and everything everything that
 
05:39:47.750 --> 05:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing in the field it needs to be
 
05:39:49.910 --> 05:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
going back and this actually ties in
 
05:39:51.410 --> 05:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
with the educator shortage I mean
 
05:39:52.430 --> 05:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that tie into
 
05:39:54.350 --> 05:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
this so I completely agree with that I
 
05:39:55.730 --> 05:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
think you know conversations with the
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
colleges the pre-service programs has to
 
05:40:00.350 --> 05:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
include things like this I do think that
 
05:40:02.448 --> 05:40:02.458 align:start position:0%
the middle school as you were talking
 
05:40:04.610 --> 05:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
about with the groups of teachers
 
05:40:06.050 --> 05:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
meeting the middle school meeting with
 
05:40:07.430 --> 05:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
the elementary school teachers and
 
05:40:08.868 --> 05:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
letting them know this isn't coming up
 
05:40:11.090 --> 05:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
the kids aren't coming up learning this
 
05:40:12.948 --> 05:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
um how can we help you we have the
 
05:40:14.750 --> 05:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
Civics Coalition that has amazing
 
05:40:16.490 --> 05:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
resources and we just need to be making
 
05:40:18.948 --> 05:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
sure as Educators together you know
 
05:40:20.270 --> 05:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
through us through them through other
 
05:40:21.830 --> 05:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
groups that we're we're letting them
 
05:40:23.570 --> 05:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
know about this um that these
 
05:40:25.010 --> 05:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
opportunities are out there so that just
 
05:40:26.510 --> 05:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
like Martha mentioned they are learning
 
05:40:27.948 --> 05:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
coding in kindergarten teachers didn't
 
05:40:29.448 --> 05:40:29.458 align:start position:0%
go to school to teach coding but they're
 
05:40:31.070 --> 05:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
doing it we can do the same thing with
 
05:40:32.750 --> 05:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
Elementary School teachers for civics
 
05:40:35.390 --> 05:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
thanks Megan
 
05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
no further question thank you very much
 
05:40:39.670 --> 05:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn Roca by the way uh
 
05:40:44.990 --> 05:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
I had on this list but I didn't get a
 
05:40:46.490 --> 05:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
card for Elka
 
05:40:49.250 --> 05:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
where he was Elko going to speak today
 
05:40:50.990 --> 05:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:40:53.150 --> 05:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
but it's right after your name
 
05:40:55.490 --> 05:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
and but I didn't get her I didn't get a
 
05:40:59.750 --> 05:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:59.760 --> 05:41:02.270 align:start position:0%
 
do

05:41:02.270 --> 05:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:06.948 --> 05:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:06.958 --> 05:41:08.890 align:start position:0%
 
good

05:41:08.890 --> 05:41:08.900 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:41:12.288 --> 05:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
well hello uh my name is Caitlin Rocca
 
05:41:12.298 --> 05:41:14.990 align:start position:0%
well hello uh my name is Caitlin Rocca
Fuller

05:41:14.990 --> 05:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
Fuller
 
05:41:18.470 --> 05:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a current uh freshman at UNH I'm
 
05:41:20.090 --> 05:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
dual majoring in political science and
 
05:41:22.368 --> 05:41:22.378 align:start position:0%
Justice studies I graduated from Exeter
 
05:41:26.810 --> 05:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
High School in the spring of 2022.
 
05:41:28.610 --> 05:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm from Ware Middle School I'm in
 
05:41:31.150 --> 05:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:33.410 --> 05:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
well I appreciate you all being here
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
today and I come in support of Bill SB
 
05:41:39.110 --> 05:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
216. I'm a part of the New Hampshire
 
05:41:41.448 --> 05:41:41.458 align:start position:0%
Civic Learning Coalition and have been
 
05:41:44.150 --> 05:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
involved in this process since I was a
 
05:41:46.610 --> 05:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
junior in high school it's been
 
05:41:49.270 --> 05:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely amazing to hear my voice
 
05:41:52.490 --> 05:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
really being heard by so many adults in
 
05:41:54.410 --> 05:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
the room and being taken into
 
05:41:57.470 --> 05:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
consideration and such important
 
05:42:01.850 --> 05:42:01.860 align:start position:0%
legislation it touched me and I watched
 
05:42:04.550 --> 05:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
as we really wrestled with problems of
 
05:42:07.368 --> 05:42:07.378 align:start position:0%
how to make this bill bipartisan how to
 
05:42:09.650 --> 05:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
support teachers how to make parents
 
05:42:11.930 --> 05:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
comfortable and really to make sure the
 
05:42:13.430 --> 05:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
students get the best education that
 
05:42:15.350 --> 05:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
they deserve
 
05:42:19.010 --> 05:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:21.110 --> 05:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'll just continue
 
05:42:25.010 --> 05:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
um really many students loved government
 
05:42:27.770 --> 05:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
class in high school it was one of their
 
05:42:30.170 --> 05:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
favorite courses they ate the
 
05:42:32.270 --> 05:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
information right up and it was
 
05:42:34.730 --> 05:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
refreshing to them to have more of an
 
05:42:36.110 --> 05:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of how their government
 
05:42:39.650 --> 05:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
worked but it was one semester in high
 
05:42:43.070 --> 05:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
school so it doesn't really stick moving
 
05:42:45.350 --> 05:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
forward as much as it should as much as
 
05:42:47.930 --> 05:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
it needs to but I think the focus really
 
05:42:50.150 --> 05:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
should be on students want to learn this
 
05:42:53.510 --> 05:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
information I had the opportunity in my
 
05:42:55.128 --> 05:42:55.138 align:start position:0%
senior year of high school to go to a
 
05:42:57.230 --> 05:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
couple fifth grade classes uh during
 
05:43:00.350 --> 05:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution Day and talk about how the
 
05:43:02.448 --> 05:43:02.458 align:start position:0%
Constitution is still relevant and why
 
05:43:04.190 --> 05:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's important to be an involved Citizen
 
05:43:07.368 --> 05:43:07.378 align:start position:0%
and know your rights and your
 
05:43:09.670 --> 05:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
obligations as a part of your community
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
they loved it the room was electric they
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
were raising their hands coming up with
 
05:43:17.208 --> 05:43:17.218 align:start position:0%
ways that they can get involved next and
 
05:43:18.830 --> 05:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
the teachers emailed me afterwards
 
05:43:19.850 --> 05:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
saying that that's all I could they
 
05:43:21.730 --> 05:43:21.740 align:start position:0%
could talk about for the rest of the day
 
05:43:23.390 --> 05:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:43:25.788 --> 05:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
um really a skill that students need to
 
05:43:27.708 --> 05:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
learn moving forward because Civics is a
 
05:43:29.510 --> 05:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
skill and it's not really being taught
 
05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
as a skill
 
05:43:33.050 --> 05:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
um we see
 
05:43:36.530 --> 05:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
and our education system with science
 
05:43:40.430 --> 05:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
and English we see academic paired with
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to use it in everyday life
 
05:43:46.250 --> 05:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
we have labs and science to complement
 
05:43:48.530 --> 05:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
the facts that we're learning we're not
 
05:43:51.770 --> 05:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
just pushed into the world not knowing
 
05:43:56.208 --> 05:43:56.218 align:start position:0%
how uh to provide a hypothesis and being
 
05:43:59.390 --> 05:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
able to come up with a procedure to be
 
05:44:01.850 --> 05:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
able to prove it or find out we were
 
05:44:01.860 --> 05:44:02.750 align:start position:0%
able to prove it or find out we were
wrong

05:44:02.750 --> 05:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
05:44:05.930 --> 05:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh similarly with English we don't just
 
05:44:08.448 --> 05:44:08.458 align:start position:0%
learn vocab or grammar we learn how to
 
05:44:10.128 --> 05:44:10.138 align:start position:0%
write an essay we learn how to formulate
 
05:44:13.250 --> 05:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
an argument the same as with Civics we
 
05:44:16.368 --> 05:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
need to have the basis and learning the
 
05:44:19.310 --> 05:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
facts what each article in our U.S
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
Constitution and our state Constitutions
 
05:44:22.970 --> 05:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
are and then being able to go forward
 
05:44:26.030 --> 05:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
and make sure our voices are heard I
 
05:44:29.090 --> 05:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
being able to sit here and talk about
 
05:44:32.448 --> 05:44:32.458 align:start position:0%
such a bill as a college student is
 
05:44:34.670 --> 05:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
amazing and I'm only able to do that
 
05:44:36.650 --> 05:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
because I was involved in the beginning
 
05:44:38.510 --> 05:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
this was something I was passionate
 
05:44:40.250 --> 05:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
about and I would like to see this
 
05:44:42.048 --> 05:44:42.058 align:start position:0%
opportunity given to students who this
 
05:44:44.510 --> 05:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
might not be their first thought of what
 
05:44:45.948 --> 05:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
they want to do but they're passionate
 
05:44:48.650 --> 05:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
about something maybe that relates to a
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
career they want to go into and a bill
 
05:44:52.970 --> 05:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
comes up or they want to
 
05:44:56.090 --> 05:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
write a bill about changes that they
 
05:44:58.190 --> 05:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
feel need to be seen this needs to
 
05:45:00.288 --> 05:45:00.298 align:start position:0%
provide be provided to all students so
 
05:45:01.850 --> 05:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
they know
 
05:45:04.788 --> 05:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
what they how they can be involved
 
05:45:08.110 --> 05:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
moving forward outside of high school
 
05:45:11.090 --> 05:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
and even in college I have many friends
 
05:45:13.010 --> 05:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
who don't know what
 
05:45:14.990 --> 05:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
um branch of government is set up in the
 
05:45:17.690 --> 05:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
Third Article of the Constitution and
 
05:45:20.090 --> 05:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
that's college students and luckily I'm
 
05:45:21.948 --> 05:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
in a class where they're being taught
 
05:45:24.830 --> 05:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
that but not everybody goes to college
 
05:45:27.970 --> 05:45:27.980 align:start position:0%
and everybody deserves that information
 
05:45:31.970 --> 05:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
that's all I had to say thank you
 
05:45:31.980 --> 05:45:33.048 align:start position:0%
that's all I had to say thank you
um

05:45:33.048 --> 05:45:33.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:36.288 --> 05:45:36.298 align:start position:0%
so I was one of 13 winners of the speech
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
challenge last year it's a civic
 
05:45:40.010 --> 05:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
education opportunity where students
 
05:45:41.628 --> 05:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
write a speech to help solve an issue
 
05:45:43.070 --> 05:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's important to them
 
05:45:44.628 --> 05:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
although I currently attend Ware Middle
 
05:45:46.490 --> 05:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
School I was homeschooled up until last
 
05:45:46.500 --> 05:45:47.208 align:start position:0%
School I was homeschooled up until last
year

05:45:47.208 --> 05:45:47.218 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:45:48.830 --> 05:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
public school gave me a lot of
 
05:45:50.530 --> 05:45:50.540 align:start position:0%
opportunities that I didn't have before
 
05:45:53.030 --> 05:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
and I've always loved been the kind of
 
05:45:55.730 --> 05:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
person who loves to be involved
 
05:45:57.288 --> 05:45:57.298 align:start position:0%
last year may have been my first year in
 
05:45:58.850 --> 05:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
public school but it was also one of my
 
05:46:00.650 --> 05:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
most successful partially because of
 
05:46:00.660 --> 05:46:02.090 align:start position:0%
most successful partially because of
civics

05:46:02.090 --> 05:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
civics
 
05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
Cemex was one of those classes that
 
05:46:05.570 --> 05:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
everyone looked forward to it was always
 
05:46:08.270 --> 05:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
fun and we knew that it was important we
 
05:46:10.128 --> 05:46:10.138 align:start position:0%
learn things in Civics that we can use
 
05:46:12.230 --> 05:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
in everyday life
 
05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
it gave us the power to fix problems and
 
05:46:16.128 --> 05:46:16.138 align:start position:0%
address issues using our own brains and
 
05:46:16.138 --> 05:46:17.390 align:start position:0%
address issues using our own brains and
opinions

05:46:17.390 --> 05:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
05:46:19.310 --> 05:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
but most of all I think he gave us hope
 
05:46:21.350 --> 05:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
most kids in this day and age have grown
 
05:46:23.030 --> 05:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
up in a world where adults tell us it's
 
05:46:24.110 --> 05:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
up to you
 
05:46:25.548 --> 05:46:25.558 align:start position:0%
it's up to you to stop climate change
 
05:46:27.230 --> 05:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's up to you to make sure everyone is
 
05:46:29.270 --> 05:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
equal it's up to you to solve the Mental
 
05:46:31.548 --> 05:46:31.558 align:start position:0%
Health crisis that this world is facing
 
05:46:33.048 --> 05:46:33.058 align:start position:0%
it's up to you to fix all of the
 
05:46:34.368 --> 05:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
problems that past Generations have
 
05:46:37.010 --> 05:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
created and someday you will have to do
 
05:46:38.208 --> 05:46:38.218 align:start position:0%
it all alone
 
05:46:40.128 --> 05:46:40.138 align:start position:0%
hearing this from adults even the ones
 
05:46:42.110 --> 05:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
who I know are doing everything they can
 
05:46:44.448 --> 05:46:44.458 align:start position:0%
to help is a lot of pressure
 
05:46:46.310 --> 05:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
hearing this can make kids want to give
 
05:46:46.320 --> 05:46:47.510 align:start position:0%
hearing this can make kids want to give
up

05:46:47.510 --> 05:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:46:49.548 --> 05:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
especially if you have no idea how
 
05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
attainable it is to begin solving these
 
05:46:54.048 --> 05:46:54.058 align:start position:0%
problems especially if we have no idea
 
05:46:55.788 --> 05:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
what our rights and responsibilities as
 
05:46:58.250 --> 05:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
Americans are especially if we have no
 
05:47:00.048 --> 05:47:00.058 align:start position:0%
idea how our government works and how we
 
05:47:01.788 --> 05:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
can get civically involved in order to
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
make these changes
 
05:47:06.470 --> 05:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
especially if we have only two years or
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
even one to learn everything we can
 
05:47:10.730 --> 05:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
about the mechanics of our government
 
05:47:12.650 --> 05:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
how can we do all of that without the
 
05:47:14.810 --> 05:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
tools gained by receiving Civics classes
 
05:47:14.820 --> 05:47:16.548 align:start position:0%
tools gained by receiving Civics classes
frequently

05:47:16.548 --> 05:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
05:47:18.590 --> 05:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
Civics has shown me how anyone can take
 
05:47:20.868 --> 05:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
part in governing their Community even a
 
05:47:23.208 --> 05:47:23.218 align:start position:0%
13 year old somewhere in New Hampshire
 
05:47:25.430 --> 05:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
Civics taught me not only about the
 
05:47:27.230 --> 05:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
problems of this world but how I can fix
 
05:47:27.240 --> 05:47:28.190 align:start position:0%
problems of this world but how I can fix
them

05:47:28.190 --> 05:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:47:30.170 --> 05:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
giving students plenty of chances to
 
05:47:31.910 --> 05:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
gain knowledge of the Constitution the
 
05:47:33.650 --> 05:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
three branches of government our economy
 
05:47:35.930 --> 05:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
and so much more will help students grow
 
05:47:37.788 --> 05:47:37.798 align:start position:0%
up to be civically minded adults who can
 
05:47:39.948 --> 05:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
properly navigate future America and its
 
05:47:41.570 --> 05:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
complicated government
 
05:47:43.190 --> 05:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
now I'm still a student so I don't
 
05:47:44.690 --> 05:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
really know how much more time we need
 
05:47:47.150 --> 05:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
to spend on this I only need no we need
 
05:47:47.160 --> 05:47:48.048 align:start position:0%
to spend on this I only need no we need
more

05:47:48.048 --> 05:47:48.058 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:47:49.730 --> 05:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
please give students the time they need
 
05:47:52.250 --> 05:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
to learn about how our government works
 
05:47:54.590 --> 05:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
give students the tools to problem solve
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
and form our own opinions rather than
 
05:47:58.430 --> 05:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
conforming to the social agenda of the
 
05:47:59.868 --> 05:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
adults in our lives
 
05:48:01.850 --> 05:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
give students the time they need to
 
05:48:03.530 --> 05:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
learn the many responsibilities and
 
05:48:05.150 --> 05:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
rights that come with being a citizen of
 
05:48:05.160 --> 05:48:06.650 align:start position:0%
rights that come with being a citizen of
America

05:48:06.650 --> 05:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
America
 
05:48:09.470 --> 05:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
please give us the opportunity to fully
 
05:48:10.970 --> 05:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
understand the structure of the
 
05:48:12.650 --> 05:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
government that we will someday be
 
05:48:14.930 --> 05:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
responsible for managing thank you thank
 
05:48:17.090 --> 05:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
you very much are the questions from the
 
05:48:17.100 --> 05:48:19.788 align:start position:0%
you very much are the questions from the
committee

05:48:19.788 --> 05:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:22.368 --> 05:48:22.378 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:48:23.990 --> 05:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
oh you have a question representative
 
05:48:25.610 --> 05:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
Cornell just just a question what did
 
05:48:27.530 --> 05:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
you write your your speech on that you
 
05:48:30.770 --> 05:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
won the contest with how can we help
 
05:48:33.530 --> 05:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
fix and limit climate change using
 
05:48:35.868 --> 05:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
cafeteria so like composting and
 
05:48:37.930 --> 05:48:37.940 align:start position:0%
donating the extra food that's packaged
 
05:48:41.570 --> 05:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:43.730 --> 05:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:48:57.190 --> 05:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:00.788 --> 05:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
is this working properly okay
 
05:49:03.708 --> 05:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon my name is Anne-Marie
 
05:49:05.570 --> 05:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
Banfield I'm a parental rights Advocate
 
05:49:08.810 --> 05:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
focused on excellence in education
 
05:49:12.170 --> 05:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
today I come here opposed to sb216 which
 
05:49:14.628 --> 05:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
might kind of surprise you after so much
 
05:49:16.850 --> 05:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
testimony but I do think it can be
 
05:49:19.970 --> 05:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
amended and possibly passed
 
05:49:21.770 --> 05:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
I'll just explain some of the problems
 
05:49:23.270 --> 05:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
that I have with it and hopefully it can
 
05:49:25.490 --> 05:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
be amended in past
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
I want to first start by saying that a
 
05:49:29.448 --> 05:49:29.458 align:start position:0%
quality content-rich academic education
 
05:49:32.690 --> 05:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
in Civics is a priority that I support I
 
05:49:34.910 --> 05:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
do not believe that sb216 as it is
 
05:49:36.770 --> 05:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
written right now offers that to
 
05:49:38.628 --> 05:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire
 
05:49:39.948 --> 05:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
it starts off with language that
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
supports a good quality academic civic
 
05:49:44.330 --> 05:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
education at our school and I think
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's good
 
05:49:47.628 --> 05:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
however then it directs Focus away from
 
05:49:49.910 --> 05:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
academic content to focusing on other
 
05:49:49.920 --> 05:49:51.110 align:start position:0%
academic content to focusing on other
activities

05:49:51.110 --> 05:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
activities
 
05:49:54.350 --> 05:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
and I will point to if you're looking
 
05:49:57.048 --> 05:49:57.058 align:start position:0%
for that IB
 
05:50:02.448 --> 05:50:02.458 align:start position:0%
lines 23 24 through 30. so basically b c
 
05:50:05.690 --> 05:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
and d are what I have an issue with
 
05:50:07.788 --> 05:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
in the original Bill these were labeled
 
05:50:10.788 --> 05:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
as Civic skills Civics dispositions
 
05:50:13.548 --> 05:50:13.558 align:start position:0%
and Civics Behavior
 
05:50:15.288 --> 05:50:15.298 align:start position:0%
and while I do appreciate the Senators
 
05:50:17.270 --> 05:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
amending the original Bill to change the
 
05:50:18.890 --> 05:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
language I do still see a problem
 
05:50:21.410 --> 05:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
including b c and d
 
05:50:23.448 --> 05:50:23.458 align:start position:0%
so what is wrong with students acquiring
 
05:50:26.448 --> 05:50:26.458 align:start position:0%
skills such as the ability to analyze a
 
05:50:28.610 --> 05:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
text and determine the reliability and
 
05:50:30.770 --> 05:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
basis of sources
 
05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
and just like competency-based education
 
05:50:34.788 --> 05:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
competencies were to be focused on
 
05:50:36.890 --> 05:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
skills too today we are seeing
 
05:50:38.930 --> 05:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
competencies focused on measuring social
 
05:50:41.330 --> 05:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
and emotional dispositions that means
 
05:50:42.590 --> 05:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
that they are measuring and sharing
 
05:50:44.868 --> 05:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
non-academic skills that are based on
 
05:50:48.048 --> 05:50:48.058 align:start position:0%
Behavior attitudes values and beliefs
 
05:50:51.350 --> 05:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
how do you measure all this subjectively
 
05:50:53.868 --> 05:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
it was before this committee and I think
 
05:50:55.850 --> 05:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
representative lead may have been the
 
05:50:58.430 --> 05:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
only one in the room with me at that
 
05:51:00.890 --> 05:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
time because it was a long time ago
 
05:51:04.788 --> 05:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
but we had bipartisan opposition to
 
05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
measuring dispositions with competency
 
05:51:09.530 --> 05:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
but education
 
05:51:11.750 --> 05:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to include skills
 
05:51:14.390 --> 05:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
then you need to explicitly spell it out
 
05:51:18.650 --> 05:51:18.660 align:start position:0%
what skills exactly do you want to put
 
05:51:22.810 --> 05:51:22.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:25.788 --> 05:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
if you offer suggestions in the RSA that
 
05:51:27.708 --> 05:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
leaves the door open to subjectively
 
05:51:29.330 --> 05:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
measuring all kinds of skills
 
05:51:31.610 --> 05:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
dispositions and behavior some of this
 
05:51:33.170 --> 05:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
should also be placed in the social
 
05:51:35.690 --> 05:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
studies academic standards
 
05:51:38.090 --> 05:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
for instance analyzing a specific text
 
05:51:41.270 --> 05:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
could be included in standards standards
 
05:51:43.548 --> 05:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
writers have an extensive background in
 
05:51:45.590 --> 05:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
the course subject and they have the
 
05:51:47.930 --> 05:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
ability to drill down to what should be
 
05:51:50.810 --> 05:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
included in terms of Civic skills then
 
05:51:53.030 --> 05:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
those standards are presented to the
 
05:51:55.670 --> 05:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
public where we get to weigh in and make
 
05:51:57.650 --> 05:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
the argument to keep the standards or
 
05:52:00.048 --> 05:52:00.058 align:start position:0%
remove them ultimately the State Board
 
05:52:01.670 --> 05:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
of Education would then make the final
 
05:52:01.680 --> 05:52:03.590 align:start position:0%
of Education would then make the final
decision

05:52:03.590 --> 05:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:52:06.830 --> 05:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
we have heard a lot today about what the
 
05:52:08.750 --> 05:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
problem in Civics is and that is
 
05:52:08.760 --> 05:52:11.150 align:start position:0%
problem in Civics is and that is
illiteracy

05:52:11.150 --> 05:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
illiteracy
 
05:52:13.690 --> 05:52:13.700 align:start position:0%
the what children don't know we've heard
 
05:52:18.288 --> 05:52:18.298 align:start position:0%
testimony today what they don't know
 
05:52:20.930 --> 05:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
good quality Civic standards and tests
 
05:52:23.330 --> 05:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
are the key to improving Civics
 
05:52:25.368 --> 05:52:25.378 align:start position:0%
education in New Hampshire that is where
 
05:52:27.010 --> 05:52:27.020 align:start position:0%
we should be focusing our attention

adding non-academic suggested skills
 
05:52:32.270 --> 05:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
behavior and dispositions no matter how
 
05:52:35.690 --> 05:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
good they are can be ignored or Worse
 
05:52:38.270 --> 05:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
Twisted into something that all of you
 
05:52:41.690 --> 05:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
have no intention on twisting
 
05:52:43.850 --> 05:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
I also have concern I think
 
05:52:45.830 --> 05:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher brought this up
 
05:52:48.948 --> 05:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh is this going to be a mandate for
 
05:52:51.890 --> 05:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:54.110 --> 05:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
that needs to be clarified I don't think
 
05:52:56.510 --> 05:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson would clarified that I
 
05:52:58.310 --> 05:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
certainly do not understand and I would
 
05:53:00.470 --> 05:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
oppose this being part of private
 
05:53:00.480 --> 05:53:01.730 align:start position:0%
oppose this being part of private
schools

05:53:01.730 --> 05:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:53:03.770 --> 05:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
there are many voices that contribute to
 
05:53:06.230 --> 05:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
education reform in this country for
 
05:53:08.270 --> 05:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
those who are familiar with Diane ravage
 
05:53:11.090 --> 05:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
a prominent education historian who has
 
05:53:12.830 --> 05:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
an enormous following of public school
 
05:53:14.868 --> 05:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
teachers across the country she
 
05:53:17.150 --> 05:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
addressed the skills movements and the
 
05:53:20.330 --> 05:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
aft's American Educator magazine in
 
05:53:22.730 --> 05:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
Spring of 2010.
 
05:53:24.830 --> 05:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
this accounting of the many attempts to
 
05:53:27.230 --> 05:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
remold public education into skills
 
05:53:29.150 --> 05:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
training is worth reading and I am going
 
05:53:31.010 --> 05:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
to give you a copy of that particular
 
05:53:33.890 --> 05:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
article I hope every one of you read it
 
05:53:36.288 --> 05:53:36.298 align:start position:0%
because it is a historical accounting of
 
05:53:38.030 --> 05:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
this Reform movement and you need to
 
05:53:41.030 --> 05:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
understand it I'm going to include the
 
05:53:43.070 --> 05:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
entire piece with my testimony but I'd
 
05:53:44.628 --> 05:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
like to read some of what she wrote
 
05:53:46.850 --> 05:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
Because this again is Shifting Focus
 
05:53:49.990 --> 05:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
away from academics to skills and other
 
05:53:53.810 --> 05:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
behaviors so here's what she says I am
 
05:53:55.670 --> 05:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
this historian of education and have
 
05:53:57.610 --> 05:53:57.620 align:start position:0%
written often about the education
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
enthusiasms and fads in the past Century
 
05:54:03.230 --> 05:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
one of my books titled left back tells
 
05:54:05.448 --> 05:54:05.458 align:start position:0%
the story of the rise and fall of one
 
05:54:07.910 --> 05:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
fat after another across the 20th
 
05:54:10.548 --> 05:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
century in brief what I found is that
 
05:54:12.548 --> 05:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
the in the land of American pedagogy
 
05:54:15.530 --> 05:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
Innovation is frequently confused with
 
05:54:17.628 --> 05:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
progress and whatever is thought to be
 
05:54:20.510 --> 05:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
new is always embraced more readily than
 
05:54:23.330 --> 05:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
what is known to be true thus
 
05:54:25.970 --> 05:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
pedagogue's policy makers thought
 
05:54:28.490 --> 05:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
leaders facilitators and elected
 
05:54:31.548 --> 05:54:31.558 align:start position:0%
officials are rushing to get aboard 21st
 
05:54:34.128 --> 05:54:34.138 align:start position:0%
century skills Express train lest they
 
05:54:35.930 --> 05:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
appear to be old-fashioned or
 
05:54:38.510 --> 05:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
traditional these terms
 
05:54:42.770 --> 05:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
being the worst of a program that can be
 
05:54:44.930 --> 05:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
hurled at any educator
 
05:54:47.810 --> 05:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
for decade after decade pedagogical
 
05:54:50.510 --> 05:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
leaders called upon the schools to free
 
05:54:52.548 --> 05:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
themselves from traditional and subject
 
05:54:52.558 --> 05:54:54.230 align:start position:0%

Cubberley Edward Elwood P Cubberley
 
05:54:59.448 --> 05:54:59.458 align:start position:0%
while dean of the education school at
 
05:55:01.970 --> 05:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
Stanford warned that it was dangerous
 
05:55:04.670 --> 05:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
for a society to educate boys and even
 
05:55:07.250 --> 05:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
girls without reference to vocational
 
05:55:10.310 --> 05:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
ends whatever they learned he insisted
 
05:55:12.230 --> 05:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
should be relevant to their future lives
 
05:55:15.590 --> 05:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
and work this sounds familiar doesn't it
 
05:55:17.690 --> 05:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
he thought it foolish to saturate them
 
05:55:20.750 --> 05:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
with a mass of knowledge that can have
 
05:55:23.030 --> 05:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
little application for the lives which
 
05:55:25.910 --> 05:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
most of them must inevit inevitably lead
 
05:55:28.368 --> 05:55:28.378 align:start position:0%
they were sure to become disappointed
 
05:55:31.250 --> 05:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
and discontented and who knew where all
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
of this discontent might lead coverly
 
05:55:36.490 --> 05:55:36.500 align:start position:0%
called his fellow Educators to abandon
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
their Antiquated academic ideals and
 
05:55:42.708 --> 05:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
instead to adapt education to the real
 
05:55:45.530 --> 05:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
life and real needs of the students this

05:55:52.730 --> 05:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
issued a major report on the education
 
05:55:56.150 --> 05:55:56.160 align:start position:0%

education
 
05:56:02.330 --> 05:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
which lacked relevance to the lives of
 
05:56:04.128 --> 05:56:04.138 align:start position:0%
these students and was certainly not
 
05:56:06.650 --> 05:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
adapted to their needs Jones wanted
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
black children to learn by doing
 
05:56:11.930 --> 05:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
which was considered to be the modern
 
05:56:15.230 --> 05:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
scientific approach to education
 
05:56:17.330 --> 05:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
it was not knowledge of the printed page
 
05:56:19.128 --> 05:56:19.138 align:start position:0%
that black students needed wrote Jones
 
05:56:21.770 --> 05:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
but knowledge of gardening small farming
 
05:56:23.990 --> 05:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
and simple Industries required in
 
05:56:26.510 --> 05:56:26.520 align:start position:0%

roles for the foreseeable future as
 
05:56:46.250 --> 05:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
Jones acknowledged in his report the
 
05:56:48.048 --> 05:56:48.058 align:start position:0%
parents of black children wanted them to
 
05:56:51.288 --> 05:56:51.298 align:start position:0%
have a an academic education but he
 
05:56:54.650 --> 05:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:56.628 --> 05:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
something similar happened in many high
 
05:56:58.368 --> 05:56:58.378 align:start position:0%
schools in the 1930s where many
 
05:57:00.410 --> 05:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
avant-garde school districts replaced
 
05:57:02.868 --> 05:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
courses like science and history with
 
05:57:04.730 --> 05:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary courses which they
 
05:57:07.788 --> 05:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
called Core curriculum or social living
 
05:57:09.890 --> 05:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
some districts merged several
 
05:57:11.628 --> 05:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
disciplines such as English social
 
05:57:13.730 --> 05:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
studies and science into a single course
 
05:57:16.548 --> 05:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
which is focused not on subject matter
 
05:57:19.190 --> 05:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
but on the students life's experience
 
05:57:21.048 --> 05:57:21.058 align:start position:0%
does this sound familiar because we're
 
05:57:22.910 --> 05:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of this today
 
05:57:25.070 --> 05:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
in a typical class students study their

own homes made maps and scaled drawings
 
05:57:30.350 --> 05:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
and analyzed such questions as the cost

of maintaining the home the cost the

cost of fuel light and power and how to

the Rosalind superintendent assured them
 
05:57:54.948 --> 05:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
that baking nut bread was an excellent
 
05:57:57.830 --> 05:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
way to learn mathematics

scans say that students didn't need to
 
05:58:35.810 --> 05:58:35.820 align:start position:0%
know anything about the Civil War or how
 
05:58:37.970 --> 05:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
to write a book report these were

in 1991 I was an assistant Secretary of

05:59:14.628 --> 05:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
there's much more to this article but
 
05:59:15.890 --> 05:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to continue because it's
 
05:59:18.708 --> 05:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
long but it's well worth reading
 
05:59:21.830 --> 05:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
like you can clearly see the elitism in
 
05:59:23.330 --> 05:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
this kind of viewpoint
 
05:59:24.948 --> 05:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
who's going to get those manual
 
05:59:27.288 --> 05:59:27.298 align:start position:0%
positions and this is why we're dumbing
 
05:59:29.270 --> 05:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
down our Public Schools
 
05:59:31.610 --> 05:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
this is what's behind the skills versus
 
05:59:34.970 --> 05:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
knowledge movement that she details in
 
05:59:36.890 --> 05:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
this historical article
 
05:59:39.170 --> 05:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
so these for these reasons I urge you to
 
05:59:43.368 --> 05:59:43.378 align:start position:0%
vote it on 216 however as I said I do
 
05:59:46.190 --> 05:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
think it could be amended I do have this
 
05:59:46.200 --> 05:59:47.690 align:start position:0%
think it could be amended I do have this
article

05:59:47.690 --> 05:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
article
 
05:59:47.700 --> 05:59:49.430 align:start position:0%
article
um

05:59:49.430 --> 05:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:52.128 --> 05:59:52.138 align:start position:0%
you asked what the problems were to get
 
05:59:55.430 --> 05:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
this taught or or why we have narrowly
 
05:59:57.288 --> 05:59:57.298 align:start position:0%
focused and we're not focusing on this I
 
05:59:59.110 --> 05:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
think some of the information was
 
06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
presented there's no standardized test
 
06:00:04.670 --> 06:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
what gets tested gets taught
 
06:00:07.010 --> 06:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
I what whether you agree with standard
 
06:00:08.930 --> 06:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
testing or not
 
06:00:11.208 --> 06:00:11.218 align:start position:0%
I think that is a beeping component as
 
06:00:12.590 --> 06:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
to why this is not being taught in
 
06:00:12.600 --> 06:00:14.150 align:start position:0%
to why this is not being taught in
schools

06:00:14.150 --> 06:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:00:17.208 --> 06:00:17.218 align:start position:0%
and then action Civics what I am seeing
 
06:00:19.430 --> 06:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
in our schools is a lot of action items
 
06:00:21.288 --> 06:00:21.298 align:start position:0%
kids can do this and they can do this
 
06:00:24.830 --> 06:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
but if you have the knowledge I mean how
 
06:00:26.810 --> 06:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
do you apply the knowledge even Diane
 
06:00:28.850 --> 06:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
ravich wrote an article years ago in the
 
06:00:30.590 --> 06:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
New York Times I think it was about you
 
06:00:32.150 --> 06:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
need knowledge first before you can
 
06:00:33.410 --> 06:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
apply it
 
06:00:36.048 --> 06:00:36.058 align:start position:0%
so everything that in that's in this
 
06:00:36.058 --> 06:00:37.010 align:start position:0%
so everything that in that's in this
bill

06:00:37.010 --> 06:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:00:40.730 --> 06:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
up until that section I think is good I
 
06:00:42.048 --> 06:00:42.058 align:start position:0%
think what what they're putting in here
 
06:00:45.708 --> 06:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
makes sense although I have to tell you
 
06:00:48.110 --> 06:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
as I'm looking at D where it says and
 
06:00:49.670 --> 06:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
the Anti-Federalist
 
06:00:52.010 --> 06:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
papers Federalists has anybody read
 
06:00:53.750 --> 06:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
those yeah
 
06:00:56.208 --> 06:00:56.218 align:start position:0%
that's seventh and 8th graders
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
do you remember what that do you
 
06:01:01.310 --> 06:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
remember reading that can you imagine
 
06:01:03.110 --> 06:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
seventh and eighth grader reading that
 
06:01:04.850 --> 06:01:04.860 align:start position:0%
and believe me I think everybody should
 
06:01:06.470 --> 06:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
read them before they before they
 
06:01:08.750 --> 06:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
graduate high school but that is very
 
06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
difficult that is an extremely difficult
 
06:01:12.530 --> 06:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
read for seventh and eighth graders and
 
06:01:14.510 --> 06:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's even discussion on what should
 
06:01:17.150 --> 06:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
be changed up on on D so I I just have
 
06:01:19.128 --> 06:01:19.138 align:start position:0%
the problem with b c and d
 
06:01:20.750 --> 06:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
06:01:25.128 --> 06:01:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:28.208 --> 06:01:28.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
06:01:39.708 --> 06:01:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:42.110 --> 06:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
hello everyone thank you so much for
 
06:01:43.610 --> 06:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
letting me come speak today as a social
 
06:01:45.410 --> 06:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
studies teacher this is a dream to be
 
06:01:48.470 --> 06:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
able to come and practice what I preach
 
06:01:51.770 --> 06:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
um so I am Haley Goodwin I teach 8th
 
06:01:53.628 --> 06:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
grade social studies I've also taught
 
06:01:56.628 --> 06:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
grades 6 through 12 and it's really fun
 
06:01:58.070 --> 06:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
to be here because I was on the more
 
06:01:59.930 --> 06:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
time Committee in the New Hampshire
 
06:02:01.970 --> 06:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
Civic Learning Coalition so I feel like
 
06:02:04.368 --> 06:02:04.378 align:start position:0%
this is my baby now growing up to be a
 
06:02:06.110 --> 06:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
teenager an adult you know sitting here
 
06:02:07.670 --> 06:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
and watching this unfold it's just
 
06:02:09.890 --> 06:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
really amazing
 
06:02:11.150 --> 06:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to talk to you about why
 
06:02:13.730 --> 06:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
this bill is so important first I'd like
 
06:02:15.650 --> 06:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
to talk to you about Civic knowledge and
 
06:02:17.750 --> 06:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
how Civic knowledge has decreased over
 
06:02:19.368 --> 06:02:19.378 align:start position:0%
the last five years that I have been an
 
06:02:21.590 --> 06:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
educator so hopefully I can wake you up
 
06:02:22.610 --> 06:02:22.620 align:start position:0%
a little bit with some of the things
 
06:02:24.590 --> 06:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm about to say
 
06:02:26.690 --> 06:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
um I've had students who do not say or
 
06:02:27.948 --> 06:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
know the words to the Pledge of
 
06:02:29.930 --> 06:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
Allegiance who believe that the country
 
06:02:33.350 --> 06:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
of Mexico is located in Wisconsin do not
 
06:02:35.208 --> 06:02:35.218 align:start position:0%
know the name of their own state or
 
06:02:37.250 --> 06:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
where to find it on a map believe that
 
06:02:40.190 --> 06:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
Thomas Jefferson was an Explorer can not
 
06:02:42.110 --> 06:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
correctly identify the president or vice
 
06:02:44.390 --> 06:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
president of the United States believe
 
06:02:46.850 --> 06:02:46.860 align:start position:0%
that there are 36 States and stars on
 
06:02:48.948 --> 06:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
the flag cannot tell you where the
 
06:02:51.230 --> 06:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are believe
 
06:02:53.030 --> 06:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
that their town is actually New
 
06:02:55.548 --> 06:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no idea why we celebrate the
 
06:02:58.430 --> 06:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
4th of July and I think the worst one
 
06:03:00.170 --> 06:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
that I've received so far is when we
 
06:03:01.910 --> 06:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
were talking about the Senate a
 
06:03:03.410 --> 06:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
student's like oh I know the Senate
 
06:03:04.910 --> 06:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
isn't his name Bill Gates or something
 
06:03:07.128 --> 06:03:07.138 align:start position:0%
like that and this is coming from a 14
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
year old
 
06:03:10.970 --> 06:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
my students do feel confident that they
 
06:03:12.590 --> 06:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
know the difference between a Republican
 
06:03:14.690 --> 06:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
and a Democrat and to them that means
 
06:03:16.970 --> 06:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
that the opposite party is the enemy or
 
06:03:19.368 --> 06:03:19.378 align:start position:0%
a stupid person in their words
 
06:03:21.410 --> 06:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation with a student last
 
06:03:23.330 --> 06:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
month we'll call her Sally and we have
 
06:03:24.890 --> 06:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
just a general conversation are you
 
06:03:27.170 --> 06:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
proud to be an American she says no I'm
 
06:03:28.610 --> 06:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
not proud to be an American because I'm
 
06:03:31.070 --> 06:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
French Canadian I said oh so were you
 
06:03:32.448 --> 06:03:32.458 align:start position:0%
born in Canada you're not trying to dig
 
06:03:34.010 --> 06:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
deeper Jesus no I was born in New
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I said oh well maybe were your
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
parents born in Canada you know trying
 
06:03:39.530 --> 06:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
to get some information no they were
 
06:03:41.810 --> 06:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
born and raised here too so I had a 14
 
06:03:43.430 --> 06:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
year old student who did not understand
 
06:03:45.110 --> 06:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
that she was a citizen of the United
 
06:03:47.628 --> 06:03:47.638 align:start position:0%
States now the problem here was not just
 
06:03:49.368 --> 06:03:49.378 align:start position:0%
her lack of knowledge but also the fact
 
06:03:50.628 --> 06:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
that she was unwilling to have a
 
06:03:53.628 --> 06:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
conversation with me to understand that
 
06:03:55.430 --> 06:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
she is indeed a citizen of the United
 
06:03:58.430 --> 06:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
States you see Civics is much more than
 
06:04:01.548 --> 06:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
just basic content knowledge it is skill
 
06:04:03.708 --> 06:04:03.718 align:start position:0%
and application of that knowledge as
 
06:04:05.030 --> 06:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
well as the understanding of core
 
06:04:06.830 --> 06:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
virtues that this nation was founded
 
06:04:06.840 --> 06:04:07.730 align:start position:0%
virtues that this nation was founded
upon

06:04:07.730 --> 06:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
upon
 
06:04:10.310 --> 06:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
teachers are seeing the consequence of
 
06:04:12.350 --> 06:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
the lack of civics education on a daily
 
06:04:14.628 --> 06:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
basis and this can be seen in today's
 
06:04:16.368 --> 06:04:16.378 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage
 
06:04:18.530 --> 06:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
many teachers are leaving the field due
 
06:04:20.390 --> 06:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
to Rising behavior issues and the lack
 
06:04:22.788 --> 06:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
of Civility and respect kids show to
 
06:04:25.490 --> 06:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
teachers and to each other
 
06:04:27.470 --> 06:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
students do receive an education on
 
06:04:29.270 --> 06:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
virtues and how to behave but that does
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
not come from parents and doesn't always
 
06:04:33.230 --> 06:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
come from teachers but it comes from the
 
06:04:35.510 --> 06:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
internet and Tick Tock where my students
 
06:04:37.128 --> 06:04:37.138 align:start position:0%
say that their heroes are people like
 
06:04:39.230 --> 06:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
Andrew Tate who say that you must be
 
06:04:41.510 --> 06:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
loud and aggressive in order to win and
 
06:04:41.520 --> 06:04:42.470 align:start position:0%
loud and aggressive in order to win and
conquer

06:04:42.470 --> 06:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
conquer
 
06:04:44.448 --> 06:04:44.458 align:start position:0%
my classroom is full of kids who have
 
06:04:46.430 --> 06:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
been shouting L's and W's because it's
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
good to be a winner and bad to be a
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
loser they have no idea how to have a
 
06:04:52.368 --> 06:04:52.378 align:start position:0%
civil conversation by the time they get
 
06:04:53.708 --> 06:04:53.718 align:start position:0%
to my classroom
 
06:04:56.448 --> 06:04:56.458 align:start position:0%
so going back to the conversation when I
 
06:04:57.948 --> 06:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
talked with students are you proud to be
 
06:05:00.170 --> 06:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
an American I learned that either they
 
06:05:02.390 --> 06:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
are not proud to be American or they are
 
06:05:04.910 --> 06:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
afraid to be they are afraid that
 
06:05:06.470 --> 06:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
showing love for their country means
 
06:05:08.690 --> 06:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
that they are racists and hateful bigots
 
06:05:11.270 --> 06:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
and this makes me sad and scared for our
 
06:05:11.280 --> 06:05:12.288 align:start position:0%
and this makes me sad and scared for our
country

06:05:12.288 --> 06:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
country
 
06:05:14.330 --> 06:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
there is a difference between patriotism
 
06:05:16.010 --> 06:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
and nationalism and we need to be able
 
06:05:18.708 --> 06:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
to teach that expressing love hope and
 
06:05:20.330 --> 06:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
appreciation for the red white and blue
 
06:05:22.070 --> 06:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
does not and should not lead our
 
06:05:23.690 --> 06:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
students to think hateful thoughts of
 
06:05:25.730 --> 06:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
one another we need to teach that the
 
06:05:28.250 --> 06:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
red white and blue is what unifies US
 
06:05:30.110 --> 06:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
now this bill does not tell teachers
 
06:05:32.868 --> 06:05:32.878 align:start position:0%
what lessons to teach how to teach or
 
06:05:34.850 --> 06:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
how many exact minutes each day to teach
 
06:05:37.490 --> 06:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
it is however a declaration that Civics
 
06:05:39.890 --> 06:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
is important and that we people of New
 
06:05:41.570 --> 06:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need to stand up and show the
 
06:05:43.548 --> 06:05:43.558 align:start position:0%
nation that Republicans and Democrats
 
06:05:45.770 --> 06:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
can come together to teach our students
 
06:05:47.690 --> 06:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
that Civic virtues and Civic knowledge
 
06:05:49.730 --> 06:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
is desperately needed
 
06:05:51.530 --> 06:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
now this December I'm getting married
 
06:05:54.170 --> 06:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
I'm very excited to my fiance who's also
 
06:05:56.628 --> 06:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
a social studies teacher and while we
 
06:05:58.670 --> 06:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
are very excited to start our lives
 
06:06:00.410 --> 06:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
together we also have a fear of what's
 
06:06:02.208 --> 06:06:02.218 align:start position:0%
going to be happening to us as we get
 
06:06:04.970 --> 06:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
older we're fear looking at our current
 
06:06:06.770 --> 06:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
Generations what's going to happen to us
 
06:06:08.750 --> 06:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
when we get older is these people lead
 
06:06:10.788 --> 06:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
our country and Lead our nation
 
06:06:12.708 --> 06:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
I miss the days where past Generations
 
06:06:14.510 --> 06:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
look to the Future ones with hope that
 
06:06:16.128 --> 06:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
they can fix it and make the world a
 
06:06:17.150 --> 06:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
better place
 
06:06:19.128 --> 06:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
right now I don't have that hope based
 
06:06:20.868 --> 06:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
on what I see and I want to find it
 
06:06:20.878 --> 06:06:21.650 align:start position:0%
on what I see and I want to find it
again

06:06:21.650 --> 06:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:06:23.448 --> 06:06:23.458 align:start position:0%
we have messed things up and we need to
 
06:06:25.190 --> 06:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
start preparing a new generation to take
 
06:06:27.230 --> 06:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
on our responsibility and to keep the
 
06:06:28.250 --> 06:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
world running
 
06:06:30.948 --> 06:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
now I have uh sat here and listened to
 
06:06:32.930 --> 06:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
questions being asked and as someone
 
06:06:34.970 --> 06:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
who's been through this process from the
 
06:06:36.470 --> 06:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
beginning and as a teacher who's been in
 
06:06:37.548 --> 06:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
the thick of it I would love to answer
 
06:06:39.590 --> 06:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might have even
 
06:06:42.948 --> 06:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
if they are repeated thank you Haley any
 
06:06:44.030 --> 06:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
06:06:46.070 --> 06:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative corneli thank you thank
 
06:06:47.690 --> 06:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
you very much for being here and your
 
06:06:49.310 --> 06:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
work as a teacher
 
06:06:49.320 --> 06:06:49.970 align:start position:0%
work as a teacher
um

06:06:49.970 --> 06:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:52.368 --> 06:06:52.378 align:start position:0%
I I take it you've you've read the bill
 
06:06:54.770 --> 06:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
and heard the testimony I was just
 
06:06:56.868 --> 06:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
wondering if if based on your experience
 
06:06:59.570 --> 06:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
you'd have any suggestions on revisions
 
06:07:01.190 --> 06:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
06:07:05.628 --> 06:07:05.638 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is the start I I
 
06:07:08.628 --> 06:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't revise it as it is written now
 
06:07:10.548 --> 06:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
um when we were writing this and looking
 
06:07:12.410 --> 06:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
at the language you know putting in the
 
06:07:14.150 --> 06:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence it was not
 
06:07:15.948 --> 06:07:15.958 align:start position:0%
in here originally I think that's really
 
06:07:17.570 --> 06:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
important and there might be some things
 
06:07:19.128 --> 06:07:19.138 align:start position:0%
that we are missing that we do believe
 
06:07:21.048 --> 06:07:21.058 align:start position:0%
need to be taught such as like I
 
06:07:23.090 --> 06:07:23.100 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Declaration and I would be
 
06:07:25.310 --> 06:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
more than happy to see suggestions to
 
06:07:27.708 --> 06:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
that but as others have said this is a
 
06:07:29.930 --> 06:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
start and
 
06:07:32.150 --> 06:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't change a thing at this
 
06:07:33.230 --> 06:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
point I think that there could be
 
06:07:36.048 --> 06:07:36.058 align:start position:0%
additions later to support Civics
 
06:07:38.030 --> 06:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
um but I believe that you need to have
 
06:07:40.368 --> 06:07:40.378 align:start position:0%
both the knowledge and the skills coming
 
06:07:41.750 --> 06:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
together because you can't have one
 
06:07:43.548 --> 06:07:43.558 align:start position:0%
without the other they really need to go
 
06:07:46.610 --> 06:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
hand in hand as I mentioned they can
 
06:07:48.548 --> 06:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
know who the president is they can know
 
06:07:51.230 --> 06:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
how many states there are and how many
 
06:07:53.448 --> 06:07:53.458 align:start position:0%
stars are on the flag but what does that
 
06:07:55.070 --> 06:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
matter if they can't sit down and have a
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
conversation with each other in a civil
 
06:07:58.850 --> 06:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
Manner and I think that we need to be
 
06:08:00.350 --> 06:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
able to teach both of those things in
 
06:08:02.208 --> 06:08:02.218 align:start position:0%
our classroom
 
06:08:02.218 --> 06:08:04.128 align:start position:0%
our classroom
representative

06:08:04.128 --> 06:08:04.138 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:08:06.110 --> 06:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Haley
 
06:08:07.970 --> 06:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions I obviously know
 
06:08:10.190 --> 06:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
your school quite well I spent 32 years
 
06:08:10.200 --> 06:08:11.330 align:start position:0%
your school quite well I spent 32 years
there

06:08:11.330 --> 06:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:08:13.070 --> 06:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
um and during that time there was a lot
 
06:08:16.128 --> 06:08:16.138 align:start position:0%
of uh fighting over how what would be
 
06:08:17.448 --> 06:08:17.458 align:start position:0%
taught at the elementary school there
 
06:08:19.010 --> 06:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough time to do anything social
 
06:08:21.470 --> 06:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
studies and science or even like it was
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
tough you know we kept talking about
 
06:08:24.350 --> 06:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
integration and and when we had World
 
06:08:26.150 --> 06:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
languages they tried to add that it was
 
06:08:28.788 --> 06:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
a fight with uh specials because if you
 
06:08:30.530 --> 06:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
want to put World Language so my
 
06:08:32.330 --> 06:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
question to you is
 
06:08:35.330 --> 06:08:35.340 align:start position:0%
um it's a dedicated class time so grades
 
06:08:37.670 --> 06:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
one to four yes what do you see that
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
looking like are you looking at you know
 
06:08:40.270 --> 06:08:40.280 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
06:08:43.850 --> 06:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
an hour a year or an hour a week how do
 
06:08:45.770 --> 06:08:45.780 align:start position:0%
you see that playing out if it was my
 
06:08:47.690 --> 06:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
own personal opinion
 
06:08:49.368 --> 06:08:49.378 align:start position:0%
um I would love to see at least an hour
 
06:08:51.708 --> 06:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
a week right now we don't even see that
 
06:08:53.628 --> 06:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
in most elementary schools across the
 
06:08:56.410 --> 06:08:56.420 align:start position:0%
state but I think if we come together
 
06:08:59.030 --> 06:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
across disciplines to say that this is
 
06:08:59.040 --> 06:09:00.350 align:start position:0%
across disciplines to say that this is
important

06:09:00.350 --> 06:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
important
 
06:09:02.628 --> 06:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
um so my Civics knowledge came from my
 
06:09:04.670 --> 06:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
mom who was a music teacher and and she
 
06:09:06.350 --> 06:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
was my music teacher for eight years and
 
06:09:07.730 --> 06:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
I remember marching around the classroom
 
06:09:09.650 --> 06:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
learning patriotic songs and and
 
06:09:11.330 --> 06:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
learning about the Star-Spangled Banner
 
06:09:12.948 --> 06:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
and its history
 
06:09:14.390 --> 06:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
um and that was my Civic knowledge I
 
06:09:15.830 --> 06:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
didn't get it from my elementary school
 
06:09:17.570 --> 06:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
teachers as much as I did from some of
 
06:09:19.610 --> 06:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
my specialist teachers you know you've
 
06:09:21.048 --> 06:09:21.058 align:start position:0%
got a picture of Chris uh Chris
 
06:09:23.390 --> 06:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
McAuliffe on the on the wall behind you
 
06:09:26.030 --> 06:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
and what an amazing way to bring Civics
 
06:09:28.430 --> 06:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
together with science and math and so I
 
06:09:30.410 --> 06:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
think if we get some camaraderie around
 
06:09:32.150 --> 06:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
this knowing that it could support our
 
06:09:34.010 --> 06:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
students and even their behavior and how
 
06:09:36.288 --> 06:09:36.298 align:start position:0%
they're acting out in class I think that
 
06:09:38.330 --> 06:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
we'd gather a lot of support to get even
 
06:09:40.730 --> 06:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
more than one hour a week I'm just
 
06:09:42.288 --> 06:09:42.298 align:start position:0%
looking at what's the minimum we can get
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
because right now we have almost nothing
 
06:09:46.730 --> 06:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
and it just makes my heart so sad
 
06:09:48.410 --> 06:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
um the more we can get the better I
 
06:09:49.910 --> 06:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that you should put a time
 
06:09:52.570 --> 06:09:52.580 align:start position:0%
limit on it just the more the merrier
 
06:09:56.690 --> 06:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so so whatever they do is
 
06:09:58.970 --> 06:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
good whatever and you're lucky that they
 
06:10:01.368 --> 06:10:01.378 align:start position:0%
do teach cursive writing in both so
 
06:10:02.990 --> 06:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's not going to go by the wayside
 
06:10:06.470 --> 06:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
but um so any any time is better than no
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
time I I do believe any time is better
 
06:10:10.850 --> 06:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
than no time and you know part of this
 
06:10:13.548 --> 06:10:13.558 align:start position:0%
is allowing for local control and
 
06:10:15.530 --> 06:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
allowing the districts to say what does
 
06:10:17.150 --> 06:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
that look like now I have my own
 
06:10:18.410 --> 06:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
opinions of what I think that should
 
06:10:20.090 --> 06:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
look like and I'm sure you do and all of
 
06:10:22.490 --> 06:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
us do but this bill was written in a way
 
06:10:25.070 --> 06:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
to support local control and I want to
 
06:10:27.110 --> 06:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
honor that and and specify that I don't
 
06:10:28.670 --> 06:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
think that that should be put into this
 
06:10:31.490 --> 06:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much thanks thank
 
06:10:33.948 --> 06:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
you for the questions now see thank you
 
06:10:36.170 --> 06:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
06:10:47.690 --> 06:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:51.048 --> 06:10:51.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and it's a nice to
 
06:10:53.390 --> 06:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
see familiar faces and see how this
 
06:10:55.970 --> 06:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
process is continuing forward
 
06:10:59.390 --> 06:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm Jay Khan for the past six years I
 
06:11:01.970 --> 06:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
was the state senator representing Keane
 
06:11:05.390 --> 06:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
and 14 other towns in Cheshire County uh
 
06:11:08.510 --> 06:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm still from Keene but I'm also a
 
06:11:10.610 --> 06:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire Civics board
 
06:11:14.330 --> 06:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
now and this is something that I think
 
06:11:17.230 --> 06:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
all of us are passionate about right
 
06:11:20.330 --> 06:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
Civics education we're participants in
 
06:11:23.770 --> 06:11:23.780 align:start position:0%
the process and and we are advocates for
 
06:11:27.410 --> 06:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
getting more people engaged in Civics so
 
06:11:29.510 --> 06:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's why we go to schools and
 
06:11:32.810 --> 06:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
classrooms and talk about uh what we do
 
06:11:36.128 --> 06:11:36.138 align:start position:0%
and why students should pay attention
 
06:11:40.250 --> 06:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
and engage and talk with us because we
 
06:11:42.230 --> 06:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
we need their voices and we need the
 
06:11:46.190 --> 06:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
questions that they want answered so
 
06:11:49.970 --> 06:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
uh I want to address first a need and
 
06:11:51.288 --> 06:11:51.298 align:start position:0%
then some of the questions that have
 
06:11:53.868 --> 06:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
come up but let me uh let me piggyback
 
06:11:57.230 --> 06:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
off of Senator Carson's opening comments
 
06:11:59.270 --> 06:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire depends on the citizenry
 
06:12:02.208 --> 06:12:02.218 align:start position:0%
that recognizes participants are a
 
06:12:04.368 --> 06:12:04.378 align:start position:0%
necessary part of our government and
 
06:12:06.250 --> 06:12:06.260 align:start position:0%
Society in this state
 
06:12:10.310 --> 06:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
and consider this about our state we
 
06:12:14.470 --> 06:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
have 430 elected officials we have
 
06:12:18.590 --> 06:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
234 towns each with 3 to 15 select
 
06:12:20.868 --> 06:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
persons or counselors they each have
 
06:12:24.110 --> 06:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
planning boards they have a conservation
 
06:12:28.610 --> 06:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
commissions we have 234 libraries in the
 
06:12:31.190 --> 06:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
state and each of those have advisory
 
06:12:34.570 --> 06:12:34.580 align:start position:0%
committees and governing issues
 
06:12:37.990 --> 06:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
195 school districts each of those
 
06:12:41.288 --> 06:12:41.298 align:start position:0%
depend on volunteers as their governance
 
06:12:45.470 --> 06:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
for their governance structure we have a
 
06:12:48.170 --> 06:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
very reliable election system in the
 
06:12:50.868 --> 06:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
state and the Secretary of State tells
 
06:12:53.350 --> 06:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
me that there are seven thousand
 
06:12:55.730 --> 06:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
individuals that make sure that those
 
06:12:58.670 --> 06:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
elections are safe and secure and act
 
06:13:00.948 --> 06:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
produce accurate results
 
06:13:03.948 --> 06:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
there are not-for-profits in this state
 
06:13:06.368 --> 06:13:06.378 align:start position:0%
that number over
 
06:13:10.310 --> 06:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
6500 in this state each of those boards
 
06:13:12.650 --> 06:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
has a board of directors maybe on
 
06:13:14.930 --> 06:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
average 10 65
 
06:13:17.208 --> 06:13:17.218 align:start position:0%
000 volunteers leading those those
 
06:13:17.218 --> 06:13:18.650 align:start position:0%
000 volunteers leading those those
boards

06:13:18.650 --> 06:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
boards
 
06:13:22.010 --> 06:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
there was 6 500 boards contribute to the
 
06:13:25.250 --> 06:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
economy of this of our state
 
06:13:28.730 --> 06:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
11 billion dollars a year
 
06:13:32.390 --> 06:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
our state employee our state as a whole
 
06:13:36.590 --> 06:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
employs uh people in government state
 
06:13:40.250 --> 06:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
and local uh some federal 84
 
06:13:43.190 --> 06:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
000 people that's 13 percent of New
 
06:13:44.750 --> 06:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Workforce
 
06:13:47.390 --> 06:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh we know that in New Hampshire's
 
06:13:49.430 --> 06:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
government we have ten thousand
 
06:13:51.650 --> 06:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
positions 10 percent of which are vacant
 
06:13:53.448 --> 06:13:53.458 align:start position:0%
and the vacancy rates in our
 
06:13:57.410 --> 06:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
municipality workforces are about equal
 
06:13:57.420 --> 06:13:58.730 align:start position:0%
municipality workforces are about equal
um

06:13:58.730 --> 06:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:01.970 --> 06:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
this is a state with less than 1.4
 
06:14:04.548 --> 06:14:04.558 align:start position:0%
million people where 25 percent of its
 
06:14:06.890 --> 06:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
Workforce is in government or non-profit
 
06:14:11.090 --> 06:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
organizations and another 330
 
06:14:13.788 --> 06:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
000 volunteers are volunteering for
 
06:14:17.750 --> 06:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
those uh in other government or uh
 
06:14:20.990 --> 06:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit organizations and then we
 
06:14:23.570 --> 06:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
know that somewhere around half of our
 
06:14:26.330 --> 06:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
the people in the State uh don't know
 
06:14:28.128 --> 06:14:28.138 align:start position:0%
our branches of government
 
06:14:31.010 --> 06:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh so we have
 
06:14:33.948 --> 06:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
a goal it's real clear what our goals
 
06:14:37.730 --> 06:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
are in this state and and how the state
 
06:14:40.788 --> 06:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
functions uh it's dependent on an
 
06:14:45.830 --> 06:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
Engaged citizenry uh but uh clearly we
 
06:14:49.850 --> 06:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
aren't giving the tools to all people to
 
06:14:52.730 --> 06:14:52.740 align:start position:0%
be part of that engagement and that's
 
06:14:54.590 --> 06:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about and it's not
 
06:14:56.510 --> 06:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
about doing it one time which is what
 
06:14:58.810 --> 06:14:58.820 align:start position:0%
our statute right now requires
 
06:15:01.750 --> 06:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh and the thank goodness it does
 
06:15:03.708 --> 06:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
06:15:05.708 --> 06:15:05.718 align:start position:0%
um but
 
06:15:09.110 --> 06:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
the idea behind this bill is to make
 
06:15:10.850 --> 06:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
sure that there is a spiraling
 
06:15:13.670 --> 06:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum something that can build upon
 
06:15:16.250 --> 06:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
previous engagement and knowledge and
 
06:15:18.650 --> 06:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
that it spirals through from
 
06:15:21.110 --> 06:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through eighth grade into
 
06:15:23.448 --> 06:15:23.458 align:start position:0%
high school and into adult life
 
06:15:25.250 --> 06:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
because that's how we're going to be
 
06:15:27.948 --> 06:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
successful as a state and engaging more
 
06:15:27.958 --> 06:15:29.448 align:start position:0%
successful as a state and engaging more
citizens

06:15:29.448 --> 06:15:29.458 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
06:15:29.458 --> 06:15:31.250 align:start position:0%
citizens
um

06:15:31.250 --> 06:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:33.048 --> 06:15:33.058 align:start position:0%
not only need to understand our rights
 
06:15:35.448 --> 06:15:35.458 align:start position:0%
but we also need to understand what our
 
06:15:37.670 --> 06:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of citizens in our
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
state and in our nation the choir of us
 
06:15:40.798 --> 06:15:41.890 align:start position:0%
state and in our nation the choir of us
um

06:15:41.890 --> 06:15:41.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:45.230 --> 06:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative McConnell McDonald thank
 
06:15:48.350 --> 06:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
you for your question earlier uh you
 
06:15:50.690 --> 06:15:50.700 align:start position:0%
said if you understand it are you more
 
06:15:53.270 --> 06:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
likely to participate I think we've
 
06:15:56.868 --> 06:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
gotten the answer today uh and and you
 
06:15:59.090 --> 06:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
may wonder what does participation look
 
06:16:01.788 --> 06:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
like in a classroom when you've got K
 
06:16:05.510 --> 06:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
through three uh and one of the one of
 
06:16:08.270 --> 06:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Civics uh uh task
 
06:16:11.090 --> 06:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
forces right now is building a k-3
 
06:16:13.430 --> 06:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum and one of the people on that
 
06:16:18.530 --> 06:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
task force uh has written that uh you
 
06:16:21.770 --> 06:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
know we vote in our classroom all the
 
06:16:23.868 --> 06:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
time all you got to do is start making
 
06:16:25.670 --> 06:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
the connections
 
06:16:28.430 --> 06:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
do you want recess now or do you want to
 
06:16:28.440 --> 06:16:29.590 align:start position:0%
do you want recess now or do you want to
read

06:16:29.590 --> 06:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
read
 
06:16:32.410 --> 06:16:32.420 align:start position:0%
do you want a snack now
 
06:16:36.288 --> 06:16:36.298 align:start position:0%
or are we going to talk about something
 
06:16:38.090 --> 06:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
in the class
 
06:16:38.100 --> 06:16:38.690 align:start position:0%
in the class
um

06:16:38.690 --> 06:16:38.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:40.910 --> 06:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
let's take a vote on what your favorite
 
06:16:42.708 --> 06:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
color is
 
06:16:45.708 --> 06:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
representative lad may say it's blue I
 
06:16:47.448 --> 06:16:47.458 align:start position:0%
may say it's green
 
06:16:49.910 --> 06:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative lead and why why do you
 
06:16:52.010 --> 06:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
prefer blue does it make you feel how
 
06:16:55.250 --> 06:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
does it make you feel uh and and so now
 
06:16:57.788 --> 06:16:57.798 align:start position:0%
you're beginning to speak about
 
06:17:01.970 --> 06:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
why you prefer one thing or another this
 
06:17:06.048 --> 06:17:06.058 align:start position:0%
is an engagement in a voting process you
 
06:17:08.448 --> 06:17:08.458 align:start position:0%
could then take a poll in the class how
 
06:17:10.850 --> 06:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
many people in here prefer green to blue
 
06:17:14.390 --> 06:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh or blue to green
 
06:17:17.930 --> 06:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
um but you see it's it's it's then the
 
06:17:20.390 --> 06:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
outcome of this and understanding the
 
06:17:23.330 --> 06:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
outcome and and respecting that hey
 
06:17:25.010 --> 06:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
there are differences when we see things
 
06:17:27.490 --> 06:17:27.500 align:start position:0%
differently and we accept those outcomes
 
06:17:31.368 --> 06:17:31.378 align:start position:0%
uh these are the Civic lessons they can
 
06:17:37.310 --> 06:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
get tied to uh our educational Cycles uh
 
06:17:39.770 --> 06:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
and and that's how we build and engage
 
06:17:43.128 --> 06:17:43.138 align:start position:0%
citizenry uh it it's when you when you
 
06:17:46.070 --> 06:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
begin to understand Civics as a habit
 
06:17:49.128 --> 06:17:49.138 align:start position:0%
you begin to accept those habits as your
 
06:17:52.730 --> 06:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and voting is a habit
 
06:17:55.490 --> 06:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
that we need to make a part of our
 
06:17:57.288 --> 06:17:57.298 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and there are many
 
06:17:59.690 --> 06:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
other Civic lessons like that
 
06:17:59.700 --> 06:18:01.070 align:start position:0%
other Civic lessons like that
um

06:18:01.070 --> 06:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:06.230 --> 06:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
so uh in short uh I know that there's
 
06:18:08.030 --> 06:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
some disagreement when you hear that
 
06:18:11.090 --> 06:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
there's some disagreement uh uh we want
 
06:18:14.330 --> 06:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
to accommodate that and trying and this
 
06:18:17.208 --> 06:18:17.218 align:start position:0%
is a bill that's tried to do that uh
 
06:18:19.730 --> 06:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
from its introduction in the Senate to
 
06:18:21.288 --> 06:18:21.298 align:start position:0%
the amendment in the Senate that was
 
06:18:25.128 --> 06:18:25.138 align:start position:0%
introduced by Senator Tim Lang a member
 
06:18:29.510 --> 06:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
of your body for many years uh it it
 
06:18:32.330 --> 06:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
leads to the local school districts the
 
06:18:35.448 --> 06:18:35.458 align:start position:0%
choice of how they're going to teach the
 
06:18:38.510 --> 06:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
content and do read the second page
 
06:18:41.390 --> 06:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
because the second page of this begins
 
06:18:44.330 --> 06:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
to identify very specifically what the
 
06:18:47.448 --> 06:18:47.458 align:start position:0%
knowledge areas are and then you begin
 
06:18:49.850 --> 06:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
to apply them and that's what the first
 
06:18:53.448 --> 06:18:53.458 align:start position:0%
page asks learn the knowledge that are
 
06:18:56.030 --> 06:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
the foundation of our nation our state
 
06:18:58.430 --> 06:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
and our communities and then begin to
 
06:18:59.570 --> 06:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
apply it
 
06:19:02.390 --> 06:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
because that's sticky learning and we've
 
06:19:05.150 --> 06:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
seen that in every level of Education
 
06:19:07.430 --> 06:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
when you learn something and you can
 
06:19:09.830 --> 06:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
apply it you are demonstrating
 
06:19:09.840 --> 06:19:11.690 align:start position:0%
apply it you are demonstrating
competency

06:19:11.690 --> 06:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
competency
 
06:19:16.128 --> 06:19:16.138 align:start position:0%
uh so I ask uh We've we've gotten a
 
06:19:18.048 --> 06:19:18.058 align:start position:0%
unanimous vote out of the Senate on this
 
06:19:21.530 --> 06:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
bill uh and I hope that we can get a
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
similar kind of response from the house
 
06:19:25.548 --> 06:19:25.558 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh members of the
 
06:19:25.558 --> 06:19:27.288 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh members of the
committee

06:19:27.288 --> 06:19:27.298 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:19:29.570 --> 06:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we have any uh
 
06:19:32.270 --> 06:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
06:19:35.810 --> 06:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Jay Khan
 
06:19:37.970 --> 06:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
seen none thank you very much okay thank
 
06:19:45.170 --> 06:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:02.090 --> 06:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:03.830 --> 06:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
I think we should have had a social
 
06:20:05.750 --> 06:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
studies teachers convention today
 
06:20:07.610 --> 06:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
because I'm also a former social studies
 
06:20:07.620 --> 06:20:10.070 align:start position:0%
because I'm also a former social studies
teacher

06:20:10.070 --> 06:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:11.690 --> 06:20:11.700 align:start position:0%
um I taught seventh and 8th grade social
 
06:20:15.590 --> 06:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
studies which included uh US history for
 
06:20:17.690 --> 06:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
a number of years in Connecticut
 
06:20:20.510 --> 06:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm also have taught school in
 
06:20:22.850 --> 06:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
Michigan and I've also taught for a
 
06:20:24.430 --> 06:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
number of years here in New Hampshire
 
06:20:27.470 --> 06:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
kindergarten for five years so I do know
 
06:20:27.480 --> 06:20:28.850 align:start position:0%
kindergarten for five years so I do know
that

06:20:28.850 --> 06:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:20:28.860 --> 06:20:31.250 align:start position:0%
that
um

06:20:31.250 --> 06:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:34.190 --> 06:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
I wanted to read uh the preface of this
 
06:20:36.948 --> 06:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
history book because it kind of stated
 
06:20:40.128 --> 06:20:40.138 align:start position:0%
everything that has been going on and
 
06:20:43.128 --> 06:20:43.138 align:start position:0%
what the twists and turns can be to
 
06:20:45.590 --> 06:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
learning about Civics and histories
 
06:20:48.048 --> 06:20:48.058 align:start position:0%
and it says to present the great facts
 
06:20:49.548 --> 06:20:49.558 align:start position:0%
of our country's history in an
 
06:20:51.410 --> 06:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
attractive and relatable form has been
 
06:20:53.208 --> 06:20:53.218 align:start position:0%
the object of this work
 
06:20:55.190 --> 06:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
that the history of the United States is
 
06:20:58.010 --> 06:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
not more generally read arises from the
 
06:21:00.190 --> 06:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
fact that the works which originally
 
06:21:02.810 --> 06:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
ordinary readers find are overloaded
 
06:21:06.010 --> 06:21:06.020 align:start position:0%
with details and interrupted by tedious
 
06:21:09.170 --> 06:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
disquisitions others seem written from a
 
06:21:12.110 --> 06:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
sectional political or other standpoint
 
06:21:14.270 --> 06:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
and the writer's prejudices are thrust
 
06:21:16.850 --> 06:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
before the reader at every page
 
06:21:19.190 --> 06:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
the author has aimed to give the
 
06:21:21.530 --> 06:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
narrative clean clearness and simplicity
 
06:21:24.170 --> 06:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
and to be impartially giving each part
 
06:21:26.868 --> 06:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
of the country an equal importance and
 
06:21:29.390 --> 06:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
equal justice in the treatment of events
 
06:21:32.448 --> 06:21:32.458 align:start position:0%
giving importance only to such as
 
06:21:35.030 --> 06:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
deserve it in view of their bearing on
 
06:21:37.310 --> 06:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
the whole country
 
06:21:39.110 --> 06:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
A History of the United States for the
 
06:21:40.910 --> 06:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
general public should be one to be read
 
06:21:43.010 --> 06:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
with equal interest in every state by
 
06:21:45.530 --> 06:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
persons of every age it should be as
 
06:21:47.330 --> 06:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
clear as the Crystal Waters of our
 
06:21:50.810 --> 06:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
purest streams as solid and impartial as
 
06:21:53.628 --> 06:21:53.638 align:start position:0%
the great mountains that receives
 
06:21:56.628 --> 06:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
Serenity the sunshine and the storm and
 
06:21:59.270 --> 06:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
look calmly down on the quiet plain and
 
06:22:02.330 --> 06:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
the thunderous cataract this value may
 
06:22:04.548 --> 06:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
not fulfill all that it is aimed at or
 
06:22:07.490 --> 06:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
desired but it can claim to have made a
 
06:22:09.170 --> 06:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
step in the proper direction towards
 
06:22:10.868 --> 06:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
affording a history of our country
 
06:22:14.390 --> 06:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
readable impartial and accurate and the
 
06:22:18.048 --> 06:22:18.058 align:start position:0%
copyright of this book is 1886.
 
06:22:21.048 --> 06:22:21.058 align:start position:0%
so as we've heard over and over as
 
06:22:23.270 --> 06:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
social studies teachers
 
06:22:24.948 --> 06:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
if we don't learn our history we're
 
06:22:28.788 --> 06:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
doomed to repeat it so even in 1886 when
 
06:22:32.208 --> 06:22:32.218 align:start position:0%
we still only had at that point I want
 
06:22:33.708 --> 06:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm remembering correctly
 
06:22:37.128 --> 06:22:37.138 align:start position:0%
that we only had 38 States
 
06:22:40.010 --> 06:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
so we still that's why it said trying to
 
06:22:41.570 --> 06:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
include all the states and all the
 
06:22:44.150 --> 06:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
terror areas and
 
06:22:44.160 --> 06:22:44.990 align:start position:0%
terror areas and
um

06:22:44.990 --> 06:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:47.810 --> 06:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
it's you know I've always had a love for
 
06:22:50.090 --> 06:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
history this was an antique book I
 
06:22:52.070 --> 06:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
picked up as a history teacher because I
 
06:22:53.868 --> 06:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
was like let's see what happened how
 
06:22:55.548 --> 06:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
history was written back then because it
 
06:22:57.590 --> 06:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
seems to have changed
 
06:23:02.948 --> 06:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
um and uh so I yes Civics needs to be
 
06:23:05.208 --> 06:23:05.218 align:start position:0%
taught in the schools I'm concerned
 
06:23:07.788 --> 06:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
about the same sections that Anne-Marie
 
06:23:10.010 --> 06:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
were concerned about and that I think
 
06:23:12.110 --> 06:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
this is a good starting point I still
 
06:23:14.090 --> 06:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
think there needs to be worked on this
 
06:23:14.100 --> 06:23:15.650 align:start position:0%
think there needs to be worked on this
bill

06:23:15.650 --> 06:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:23:15.660 --> 06:23:16.690 align:start position:0%
bill
um

06:23:16.690 --> 06:23:16.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:20.150 --> 06:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
and uh I keep hearing that everyone
 
06:23:22.850 --> 06:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
talks about No Child Left Behind well No
 
06:23:25.850 --> 06:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
Child Left Behind stopped in 2015. we've
 
06:23:27.410 --> 06:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
had almost a decade
 
06:23:29.810 --> 06:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
to make up for any mistake or any
 
06:23:32.150 --> 06:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
misgivings from No Child Left Behind and
 
06:23:34.548 --> 06:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
in the decade if that hasn't happened
 
06:23:37.548 --> 06:23:37.558 align:start position:0%
then that is not should not be
 
06:23:39.890 --> 06:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
the fault of a program that was over 10
 
06:23:41.930 --> 06:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
years ago you've had a decade to make
 
06:23:45.470 --> 06:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
changes and the Essa again did not focus
 
06:23:48.128 --> 06:23:48.138 align:start position:0%
on social studies it focused on reading
 
06:23:51.470 --> 06:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
and Science and Math because that's
 
06:23:53.208 --> 06:23:53.218 align:start position:0%
where they want their Workforce to go
 
06:23:55.430 --> 06:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
towards and
 
06:23:57.470 --> 06:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
um they don't feel like Civic knowledge
 
06:23:58.990 --> 06:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be there
 
06:24:02.208 --> 06:24:02.218 align:start position:0%
when I did teach us history we did get
 
06:24:04.010 --> 06:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
to the Constitution we went through it
 
06:24:06.670 --> 06:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
it was fascinating to engage students
 
06:24:09.230 --> 06:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
I'm from a family that my parents I've
 
06:24:11.030 --> 06:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
known from a young age that yes you have
 
06:24:14.270 --> 06:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
to be involved my mother was on this PTA
 
06:24:16.610 --> 06:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
school board and just now at the age of
 
06:24:19.368 --> 06:24:19.378 align:start position:0%
74 years old she stopped being a town
 
06:24:22.670 --> 06:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
council member in her town so I grew up
 
06:24:26.570 --> 06:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
with Civics and politics and everything
 
06:24:26.580 --> 06:24:27.470 align:start position:0%
with Civics and politics and everything
um

06:24:27.470 --> 06:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:27.480 --> 06:24:29.390 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:24:29.390 --> 06:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:31.850 --> 06:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
while I agree that we do have to have
 
06:24:33.590 --> 06:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
cynics we also need to find a way to
 
06:24:35.810 --> 06:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
take something off the teacher's plates
 
06:24:38.270 --> 06:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
if you're going to require this then we
 
06:24:39.850 --> 06:24:39.860 align:start position:0%
need to take something off their plates
 
06:24:43.310 --> 06:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
so as a second grade teacher I had to
 
06:24:45.410 --> 06:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
fit in all the reading I had to fit in
 
06:24:50.390 --> 06:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
all the math I had to fit in all of the
 
06:24:52.670 --> 06:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
phonics and the writing and yes we still
 
06:24:53.990 --> 06:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
did handwriting when I taught second
 
06:24:54.000 --> 06:24:55.010 align:start position:0%
did handwriting when I taught second
grade

06:24:55.010 --> 06:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
grade
 
06:24:57.948 --> 06:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
but then we had to do this whole weekly
 
06:24:59.990 --> 06:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
thing almost every day about social
 
06:25:03.350 --> 06:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
emotional learning well something had to
 
06:25:05.990 --> 06:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
drop and yes science and social studies
 
06:25:08.690 --> 06:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
had to drop a lot of times I didn't drop
 
06:25:10.970 --> 06:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
it I made sure it was in my classroom
 
06:25:12.650 --> 06:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
but a lot of teachers they couldn't
 
06:25:14.090 --> 06:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
figure out how to fit it in because
 
06:25:15.650 --> 06:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
you've got kids being pulled out for
 
06:25:17.170 --> 06:25:17.180 align:start position:0%
this thing and this thing and this thing
 
06:25:19.850 --> 06:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
and if you don't take something off
 
06:25:21.830 --> 06:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
their plate this is still not going to
 
06:25:24.110 --> 06:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
get put in there even if you pass this
 
06:25:26.448 --> 06:25:26.458 align:start position:0%
law and have this requirement it's still
 
06:25:27.530 --> 06:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
not going to get in the school day
 
06:25:28.850 --> 06:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
because there's not enough time in the
 
06:25:31.670 --> 06:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
day because you're also dealing with the
 
06:25:33.410 --> 06:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
bloody nose in the corner because all of
 
06:25:35.570 --> 06:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
a sudden so and so just got a bloody
 
06:25:37.788 --> 06:25:37.798 align:start position:0%
nose for whatever reason or someone has
 
06:25:39.890 --> 06:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
a stomach ache or you have all that and
 
06:25:43.128 --> 06:25:43.138 align:start position:0%
all those little times of missing out on
 
06:25:44.930 --> 06:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
learning happen and there's nothing you
 
06:25:47.030 --> 06:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
can do to prevent it or the fire drill
 
06:25:48.948 --> 06:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
that goes off
 
06:25:51.530 --> 06:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
um so and again you know I keep hearing
 
06:25:53.448 --> 06:25:53.458 align:start position:0%
about you know learning about behavior
 
06:25:55.610 --> 06:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
and learning about concerns that starts
 
06:25:58.010 --> 06:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
in kindergarten I mean everything you
 
06:25:59.750 --> 06:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
know you learned in kindergarten and you
 
06:26:01.430 --> 06:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
learned how to behave you learned how to
 
06:26:03.590 --> 06:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
get along and you learn those skills in
 
06:26:06.350 --> 06:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
kindergarten it sickens me that we're
 
06:26:09.350 --> 06:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
talking about coding in kindergarten no
 
06:26:11.570 --> 06:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
that's not what you need to learn in
 
06:26:13.128 --> 06:26:13.138 align:start position:0%
kindergarten you need to learn to behave
 
06:26:15.770 --> 06:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
you learn schools rules and you learn
 
06:26:18.410 --> 06:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
what is acceptable in working with
 
06:26:21.230 --> 06:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
others coding is not going to teach you
 
06:26:23.030 --> 06:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
those skills and if you don't learn them
 
06:26:24.530 --> 06:26:24.540 align:start position:0%
in kindergarten there's no way you're
 
06:26:26.868 --> 06:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
going to keep on going up onto those
 
06:26:28.670 --> 06:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
other grades so coding needs to get out
 
06:26:30.830 --> 06:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
of kindergarten and the last thing I
 
06:26:33.048 --> 06:26:33.058 align:start position:0%
have to say is I keep hearing people
 
06:26:35.150 --> 06:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
talking about that our country has a
 
06:26:38.770 --> 06:26:38.780 align:start position:0%
democracy we are a republic
 
06:26:40.730 --> 06:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:26:43.548 --> 06:26:43.558 align:start position:0%
we are a republic our founding fathers
 
06:26:46.548 --> 06:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
did not trust the masses we do not rule
 
06:26:50.570 --> 06:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
by masses we rule by a republic we elect
 
06:26:50.580 --> 06:26:51.890 align:start position:0%
by masses we rule by a republic we elect
you

06:26:51.890 --> 06:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:26:54.048 --> 06:26:54.058 align:start position:0%
to represent us
 
06:26:58.010 --> 06:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
and to hopefully meet our needs and then
 
06:27:01.368 --> 06:27:01.378 align:start position:0%
pass laws and agree to all of that I
 
06:27:04.190 --> 06:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
also grew up on Schoolhouse Rock I mean
 
06:27:05.570 --> 06:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
that's where a lot of my Civic
 
06:27:07.368 --> 06:27:07.378 align:start position:0%
information came from as a little kid
 
06:27:08.990 --> 06:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
Saturday morning cartoons you got
 
06:27:10.548 --> 06:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
inundated and you saw those Schoolhouse
 
06:27:13.430 --> 06:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
Rocks over and over and over again and I
 
06:27:15.530 --> 06:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
use those in my curriculum and in my
 
06:27:17.628 --> 06:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
teaching because that was a way to get
 
06:27:19.010 --> 06:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
to the students
 
06:27:21.530 --> 06:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
but again if you want to include this
 
06:27:22.850 --> 06:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
and you want a way to get this in the
 
06:27:24.048 --> 06:27:24.058 align:start position:0%
classroom take something off the
 
06:27:25.430 --> 06:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
teacher's plates
 
06:27:28.250 --> 06:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions thank you any
 
06:27:30.530 --> 06:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
06:27:32.330 --> 06:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much all right
 
06:27:32.340 --> 06:27:35.150 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much all right
Republic

06:27:35.150 --> 06:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:54.128 --> 06:27:54.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:57.170 --> 06:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Deborah has an American
 
06:28:00.170 --> 06:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
Federation of teachers and I'm here to
 
06:28:03.230 --> 06:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of Senate Bill 216 but
 
06:28:05.750 --> 06:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
also you know Express a little bit of
 
06:28:05.760 --> 06:28:06.708 align:start position:0%
also you know Express a little bit of
reservation

06:28:06.708 --> 06:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
reservation
 
06:28:06.718 --> 06:28:07.548 align:start position:0%
reservation
um

06:28:07.548 --> 06:28:07.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:09.708 --> 06:28:09.718 align:start position:0%
my background is from teaching
 
06:28:11.390 --> 06:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
Elementary so I will actually agree with
 
06:28:13.250 --> 06:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
some of what the previous speaker was
 
06:28:14.868 --> 06:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
saying but I'll start with the parts in
 
06:28:17.150 --> 06:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
favor uh teaching Civics is very
 
06:28:18.708 --> 06:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
important and it can be done at the
 
06:28:20.330 --> 06:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
elementary level
 
06:28:22.670 --> 06:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
um so I want to say that right off the
 
06:28:26.868 --> 06:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
bat Civics is all about how we agree to
 
06:28:30.170 --> 06:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
you know work together and make rules
 
06:28:32.270 --> 06:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
how we influence the roles that are
 
06:28:34.548 --> 06:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
being made and how whether we
 
06:28:36.530 --> 06:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
participate or not those rules do apply
 
06:28:39.470 --> 06:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
to us so it is important to know how
 
06:28:41.948 --> 06:28:41.958 align:start position:0%
rules are made and how you can
 
06:28:44.330 --> 06:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
participate in the making of them and
 
06:28:48.830 --> 06:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
and shape them if you want to if you
 
06:28:50.030 --> 06:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
don't agree with the rules that are
 
06:28:51.350 --> 06:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
being made whether that is in your
 
06:28:53.810 --> 06:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
classroom in your town in your state or
 
06:28:56.448 --> 06:28:56.458 align:start position:0%
in your country so it's very important
 
06:28:58.128 --> 06:28:58.138 align:start position:0%
for students to begin learning that when
 
06:29:00.288 --> 06:29:00.298 align:start position:0%
they are young
 
06:29:03.128 --> 06:29:03.138 align:start position:0%
in elementary school there are
 
06:29:06.350 --> 06:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities to incorporate that in
 
06:29:09.830 --> 06:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
other things you are doing such as your
 
06:29:11.990 --> 06:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
every day you have a morning meeting in
 
06:29:15.230 --> 06:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
most classrooms and there you do
 
06:29:17.810 --> 06:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
um have you
 
06:29:19.788 --> 06:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
you make your classroom rules and you
 
06:29:22.430 --> 06:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
often will be voting on things
 
06:29:24.708 --> 06:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
so you know what what role shall we have
 
06:29:26.750 --> 06:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can work and learn together
 
06:29:29.090 --> 06:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
without interrupting each other or
 
06:29:31.430 --> 06:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
taking away from others learning so that
 
06:29:33.830 --> 06:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
is one opportunity to have a small
 
06:29:36.650 --> 06:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
civics lesson on a level that students
 
06:29:39.170 --> 06:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
can very easily grasp
 
06:29:39.180 --> 06:29:40.030 align:start position:0%
can very easily grasp
um

06:29:40.030 --> 06:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:42.650 --> 06:29:42.660 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
06:29:44.570 --> 06:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
um you know one opportunity there are
 
06:29:46.670 --> 06:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
many opportunities to work in
 
06:29:49.910 --> 06:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
non-fiction reading at you know
 
06:29:52.610 --> 06:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
age appropriate levels as you go through
 
06:29:55.250 --> 06:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
Elementary School where you are reading
 
06:29:58.010 --> 06:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
things that would be also teaching them
 
06:30:00.948 --> 06:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
Civics lessons I did hear you asked the
 
06:30:03.530 --> 06:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
question representative Hall about how
 
06:30:05.090 --> 06:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
much time per week
 
06:30:07.730 --> 06:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
I think it is much more important to
 
06:30:12.170 --> 06:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
look at a series of Standards or
 
06:30:14.330 --> 06:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
learning targets so that you are
 
06:30:19.208 --> 06:30:19.218 align:start position:0%
teaching Civics as a
 
06:30:22.190 --> 06:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable curriculum or series of goals
 
06:30:23.990 --> 06:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
things you want the students to be able
 
06:30:26.810 --> 06:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
to understand learn and do
 
06:30:29.868 --> 06:30:29.878 align:start position:0%
um rather than so many minutes per week
 
06:30:32.030 --> 06:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
because there just really is not that
 
06:30:34.190 --> 06:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
much time in the school day to say you
 
06:30:36.708 --> 06:30:36.718 align:start position:0%
know if I just can get 30 minutes a week
 
06:30:38.628 --> 06:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
or 45 minutes a week they'll definitely
 
06:30:41.270 --> 06:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
know how to do what they need to do not
 
06:30:41.280 --> 06:30:42.770 align:start position:0%
know how to do what they need to do not
necessarily

06:30:42.770 --> 06:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
06:30:46.070 --> 06:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
um because as you know was very well
 
06:30:49.970 --> 06:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
Illustrated often things interfere and
 
06:30:53.090 --> 06:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
um you won't always get everyone where
 
06:30:54.948 --> 06:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
they need to be in that amount of time
 
06:30:57.470 --> 06:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
or some students will be ahead of where
 
06:30:58.730 --> 06:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
they need to be
 
06:31:02.448 --> 06:31:02.458 align:start position:0%
so while I support what the intent of
 
06:31:05.750 --> 06:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is I do have some concerns
 
06:31:08.868 --> 06:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
if we pass this
 
06:31:11.090 --> 06:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
we also need to be supporting
 
06:31:13.610 --> 06:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
particularly our teachers in K through
 
06:31:16.850 --> 06:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
five k through six with
 
06:31:20.208 --> 06:31:20.218 align:start position:0%
updated social studies standards that
 
06:31:22.490 --> 06:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
districts can adopt
 
06:31:25.430 --> 06:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
if they want we're not mandating that
 
06:31:27.650 --> 06:31:27.660 align:start position:0%
they adopt these standards but the the
 
06:31:29.990 --> 06:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
learning targets that they can use so
 
06:31:31.868 --> 06:31:31.878 align:start position:0%
that you will have a consistent
 
06:31:35.270 --> 06:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
curriculum we need to be supporting them
 
06:31:38.868 --> 06:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
with examples of the resources and
 
06:31:40.430 --> 06:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
curriculums that would be appropriate
 
06:31:43.670 --> 06:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
for teaching Civics particularly at
 
06:31:45.350 --> 06:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
those younger grades as has pointed out
 
06:31:48.250 --> 06:31:48.260 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot out there commercially
 
06:31:50.750 --> 06:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Historical Society has
 
06:31:52.368 --> 06:31:52.378 align:start position:0%
some wonderful stuff for kind of
 
06:31:54.590 --> 06:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
starting with Upper Elementary but we
 
06:31:58.190 --> 06:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
need a lot of filling in that lower
 
06:32:01.610 --> 06:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
elementary level and professional
 
06:32:03.110 --> 06:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
development again at the elementary
 
06:32:06.890 --> 06:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
level we do have some teachers who
 
06:32:09.708 --> 06:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
are not confident in teaching Civics
 
06:32:11.930 --> 06:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
maybe because they haven't looked at it
 
06:32:14.510 --> 06:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
so much as a separate
 
06:32:14.520 --> 06:32:15.410 align:start position:0%
so much as a separate
um

06:32:15.410 --> 06:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:17.810 --> 06:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
discipline from what they are already
 
06:32:19.548 --> 06:32:19.558 align:start position:0%
teaching yeah they're confident in
 
06:32:20.868 --> 06:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
teaching math confident in teaching
 
06:32:22.430 --> 06:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
reading they haven't really been asked
 
06:32:25.430 --> 06:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
to teach Civics so those are my
 
06:32:28.310 --> 06:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
reservations about this bill
 
06:32:30.948 --> 06:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
my colleagues on the New Hampshire
 
06:32:33.650 --> 06:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
Civics Learning Coalition are confident
 
06:32:37.310 --> 06:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:40.448 --> 06:32:40.458 align:start position:0%
work together to provide some resources
 
06:32:42.530 --> 06:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
when this bill was first written they
 
06:32:44.270 --> 06:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
always say commission attached to it who
 
06:32:46.090 --> 06:32:46.100 align:start position:0%
would have helped with that information
 
06:32:49.010 --> 06:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
piece but it was taken out when the bill
 
06:32:52.610 --> 06:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
was amended so I guess my closing would
 
06:32:52.620 --> 06:32:53.510 align:start position:0%
was amended so I guess my closing would
be

06:32:53.510 --> 06:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:32:56.150 --> 06:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
something that would make sure the
 
06:32:57.590 --> 06:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
implementation of this doesn't get lost
 
06:32:59.390 --> 06:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't just get dropped with yes
 
06:33:01.010 --> 06:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
we've got some wonderful ideas we think
 
06:33:02.930 --> 06:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
they all should be taught you all figure
 
06:33:06.230 --> 06:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
out how to do it that doesn't really
 
06:33:07.670 --> 06:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
help our students in the long run
 
06:33:09.410 --> 06:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
because you all figure out how to do it
 
06:33:11.270 --> 06:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
ends up being oh my gosh one more thing
 
06:33:14.150 --> 06:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
on my plate how does it get done
 
06:33:16.368 --> 06:33:16.378 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
06:33:18.048 --> 06:33:18.058 align:start position:0%
um that's all I really need to say today
 
06:33:20.690 --> 06:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions and try to enter my
 
06:33:22.970 --> 06:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
second thank you any questions from the
 
06:33:22.980 --> 06:33:24.288 align:start position:0%
second thank you any questions from the
committee

06:33:24.288 --> 06:33:24.298 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:33:26.150 --> 06:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
I've seen none thank you very much for
 
06:33:27.230 --> 06:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
being here
 
06:33:30.770 --> 06:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
uh Kathleen Cuddy Egbert thank you for
 
06:33:39.770 --> 06:33:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:41.868 --> 06:33:41.878 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the opportunity to
 
06:33:43.910 --> 06:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
testify today and I'll try to be brief
 
06:33:45.650 --> 06:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
because I know this has been a very long
 
06:33:48.530 --> 06:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
session for you and I'm not sure I'm
 
06:33:51.048 --> 06:33:51.058 align:start position:0%
going to say anything that's really a
 
06:33:52.310 --> 06:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
whole lot different from what you've
 
06:33:55.788 --> 06:33:55.798 align:start position:0%
heard but with my experience I might be
 
06:33:58.430 --> 06:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
able to affirm a few things for you
 
06:33:58.440 --> 06:33:59.990 align:start position:0%
able to affirm a few things for you
so

06:33:59.990 --> 06:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:34:01.670 --> 06:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
um as you know my name is Kathy Cudi
 
06:34:01.680 --> 06:34:02.570 align:start position:0%
um as you know my name is Kathy Cudi
Egbert

06:34:02.570 --> 06:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
Egbert
 
06:34:05.208 --> 06:34:05.218 align:start position:0%
I'm a recently retired superintendent
 
06:34:07.910 --> 06:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
currently an education consultant
 
06:34:09.770 --> 06:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
a member of the New Hampshire Civics
 
06:34:09.780 --> 06:34:10.970 align:start position:0%
a member of the New Hampshire Civics
coalition

06:34:10.970 --> 06:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
coalition
 
06:34:12.288 --> 06:34:12.298 align:start position:0%
a member of the New Hampshire
 
06:34:14.930 --> 06:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
Association of school administrators
 
06:34:17.030 --> 06:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
a parent of two daughters and the wife
 
06:34:19.250 --> 06:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
of a political science Professor so that
 
06:34:20.628 --> 06:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
might have something to do with my
 
06:34:20.638 --> 06:34:21.850 align:start position:0%
might have something to do with my
perspective

06:34:21.850 --> 06:34:21.860 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
06:34:24.770 --> 06:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to testify in support of
 
06:34:28.250 --> 06:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
SB 216 and I I do want to make it clear
 
06:34:31.788 --> 06:34:31.798 align:start position:0%
however I'm testifying on my own behalf
 
06:34:33.530 --> 06:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
um and there is you've already heard
 
06:34:35.510 --> 06:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
that there's broad support that this is
 
06:34:37.670 --> 06:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
a nonpartisan bill so I don't need to
 
06:34:40.670 --> 06:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that I think it's clear to
 
06:34:42.610 --> 06:34:42.620 align:start position:0%
everyone that
 
06:34:45.170 --> 06:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
children in the United States attend
 
06:34:47.330 --> 06:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
schools across the country have a right
 
06:34:50.390 --> 06:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
to a free public education and that has
 
06:34:54.070 --> 06:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
everything to do with Civics
 
06:34:56.690 --> 06:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
our form of government requires an
 
06:34:58.430 --> 06:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
educated citizenry in order to
 
06:35:00.530 --> 06:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
participate fully and to self-govern
 
06:35:03.650 --> 06:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
successfully the primary purpose behind
 
06:35:05.990 --> 06:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
the founding of public education
 
06:35:08.690 --> 06:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
was to educate children of all walks of
 
06:35:10.490 --> 06:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
life together
 
06:35:12.770 --> 06:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
to develop some common knowledge and
 
06:35:14.628 --> 06:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
understandings and citizenship and I
 
06:35:16.070 --> 06:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
know you've heard that before but I
 
06:35:17.810 --> 06:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
think it's so important that I wanted to
 
06:35:19.390 --> 06:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
say it again
 
06:35:22.190 --> 06:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
in recent years math literacy and
 
06:35:24.288 --> 06:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
science have been the primary focus in
 
06:35:26.690 --> 06:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
school and unfortunately and you've
 
06:35:28.430 --> 06:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
heard this before as well that
 
06:35:30.770 --> 06:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
high-stakes testing in these areas has
 
06:35:33.410 --> 06:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
intensified this Focus
 
06:35:35.628 --> 06:35:35.638 align:start position:0%
the result has been less time and
 
06:35:37.850 --> 06:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
attention devoted to civics
 
06:35:40.970 --> 06:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
educating students in math literacy and
 
06:35:43.128 --> 06:35:43.138 align:start position:0%
science is necessary for an educated
 
06:35:45.650 --> 06:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
citizenry but certainly not sufficient
 
06:35:47.208 --> 06:35:47.218 align:start position:0%
and you've heard about all of the
 
06:35:49.970 --> 06:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
reports indicating how important Civics
 
06:35:51.470 --> 06:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
education is so I'm not going to go into
 
06:35:54.708 --> 06:35:54.718 align:start position:0%
any of that again but I do think one of
 
06:35:57.890 --> 06:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
the most important elements of SB 216 is
 
06:36:00.048 --> 06:36:00.058 align:start position:0%
the fact that it elevates the importance
 
06:36:02.230 --> 06:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
of civics education
 
06:36:04.970 --> 06:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
with the decrease in attention to social
 
06:36:04.980 --> 06:36:06.948 align:start position:0%
with the decrease in attention to social
studies

06:36:06.948 --> 06:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
studies
 
06:36:09.350 --> 06:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that has concerned
 
06:36:11.570 --> 06:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
me and you've heard this before too is
 
06:36:14.150 --> 06:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
the increase of incivility in our public
 
06:36:14.160 --> 06:36:15.530 align:start position:0%
the increase of incivility in our public
discourse

06:36:15.530 --> 06:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
discourse
 
06:36:18.110 --> 06:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
political polarization has made it
 
06:36:21.288 --> 06:36:21.298 align:start position:0%
increasingly difficult
 
06:36:24.170 --> 06:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
um for for our government to forge a
 
06:36:26.510 --> 06:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
consensus about how to address our
 
06:36:28.788 --> 06:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
country's many challenges the evidence
 
06:36:30.470 --> 06:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
that students need to learn that
 
06:36:32.390 --> 06:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
conflict is an inherent part of our
 
06:36:35.030 --> 06:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
democracy and that we must help develop
 
06:36:37.788 --> 06:36:37.798 align:start position:0%
the ability to weigh evidence and this
 
06:36:40.850 --> 06:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
is I I think this is maybe not gotten a
 
06:36:42.170 --> 06:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
lot of attention in some of the
 
06:36:44.470 --> 06:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
discussion but weighing evidence
 
06:36:47.990 --> 06:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
analyzing primary sources understanding
 
06:36:50.350 --> 06:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
conflicting perspectives making
 
06:36:52.910 --> 06:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
evidence-based arguments and especially
 
06:36:55.788 --> 06:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
demonstrating a respect for complexity
 
06:36:59.030 --> 06:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
and differing perspectives and engaging
 
06:37:01.730 --> 06:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
in respectful dialogue now naturally
 
06:37:04.970 --> 06:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
there has to be a content and knowledge
 
06:37:07.990 --> 06:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
base in order to do all of that so
 
06:37:10.490 --> 06:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
contrary to some of the discussion that
 
06:37:12.708 --> 06:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
you heard today I believe that's implied
 
06:37:14.390 --> 06:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
of course there has to be a knowledge
 
06:37:14.400 --> 06:37:15.548 align:start position:0%
of course there has to be a knowledge
base

06:37:15.548 --> 06:37:15.558 align:start position:0%
base
 
06:37:19.070 --> 06:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
as with math literacy and science Civics
 
06:37:21.410 --> 06:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
education needs to begin early
 
06:37:23.868 --> 06:37:23.878 align:start position:0%
and again a little bit of a Different
 
06:37:26.208 --> 06:37:26.218 align:start position:0%
Twist I Was An Early Childhood educator
 
06:37:28.250 --> 06:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
that's one of the the
 
06:37:30.708 --> 06:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
um areas that I taught before I became
 
06:37:33.948 --> 06:37:33.958 align:start position:0%
an administrator and going through my
 
06:37:35.750 --> 06:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
schools when I was a superintendent
 
06:37:38.570 --> 06:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
teachers began Civics in kindergarten
 
06:37:41.030 --> 06:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
with activities not not just voting on
 
06:37:43.670 --> 06:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
certain things but such class rewarding
 
06:37:46.548 --> 06:37:46.558 align:start position:0%
meetings lessons lessons about people in
 
06:37:49.128 --> 06:37:49.138 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood and those citizens in
 
06:37:50.330 --> 06:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood and what they
 
06:37:52.910 --> 06:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
contribute to society student
 
06:37:55.368 --> 06:37:55.378 align:start position:0%
responsibilities developing the
 
06:37:58.910 --> 06:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
classroom and making sure that there's a
 
06:38:01.970 --> 06:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
sense of community and responsibility as
 
06:38:03.850 --> 06:38:03.860 align:start position:0%
students participate in that classroom
 
06:38:07.208 --> 06:38:07.218 align:start position:0%
so teachers are incorporating Civics now
 
06:38:10.128 --> 06:38:10.138 align:start position:0%
but I do agree that they need to do it
 
06:38:10.138 --> 06:38:11.270 align:start position:0%
but I do agree that they need to do it
and

06:38:11.270 --> 06:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:38:14.090 --> 06:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
um in a more intentional and
 
06:38:16.430 --> 06:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
developmentally sequenced manner there's
 
06:38:18.288 --> 06:38:18.298 align:start position:0%
a lot of time spent on professional
 
06:38:20.868 --> 06:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
development for reading science and math
 
06:38:23.690 --> 06:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
but little time spent on professional
 
06:38:25.910 --> 06:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
development for civics education I think
 
06:38:27.708 --> 06:38:27.718 align:start position:0%
you've heard that you know there needs
 
06:38:29.810 --> 06:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
to be resources Etc
 
06:38:32.208 --> 06:38:32.218 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's the importance of
 
06:38:34.250 --> 06:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
students were elevated we'd see more of
 
06:38:36.110 --> 06:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
a focus on professional development and
 
06:38:38.090 --> 06:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to wrap this up because
 
06:38:40.730 --> 06:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
I can see that you are all tired
 
06:38:43.970 --> 06:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
um so in summary uh I I believe critic
 
06:38:46.310 --> 06:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
of civics education is important for our
 
06:38:48.530 --> 06:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
children to have the tools necessary to
 
06:38:51.048 --> 06:38:51.058 align:start position:0%
sustain the democracy and and I don't
 
06:38:54.048 --> 06:38:54.058 align:start position:0%
think it's too dramatic to say that our
 
06:38:56.090 --> 06:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
democracy depends on it and I do support
 
06:38:57.910 --> 06:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
hope that you'll support
 
06:39:00.110 --> 06:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
