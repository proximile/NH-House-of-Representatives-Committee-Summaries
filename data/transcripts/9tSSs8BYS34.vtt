00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
all right um uh uh I'm going to call the
 
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh executive session of the uh Judiciary
 
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
Committee to order and I'm going to
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
recognize uh representative lonza to
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
Alle States America the for stands one
 
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.470 align:start position:0%
Alle States America the for stands one
nation

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
glance all right
 
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
um we're going to uh I'm going to turn
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
to uh House Bill
 
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
10002 uh
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
first and
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
um my sense is um as as we discussed um
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
at our in in the Republican caucus last
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
night and now based upon the discussions
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
I've had with the ranking member uh this
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
morning my sense is that we are divided
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
on this on a sort of bipartisan basis
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
there are uh Republicans and Democrats
 
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
on both sides that uh favor the bill and
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
that do not and so um I guess what I'd
 
00:12:44.189 --> 00:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
like to do is um is take a straw vote uh
 
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
before we have an actual vote on this uh
 
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
and then my my plan candidly would be
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
that whichever whichever side is in the
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
majority I would recognize that person
 
00:12:59.069 --> 00:12:59.079 align:start position:0%
to make the motion uh for whatever side
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
that is uh we'll take a vote on that and
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
then we'll have uh those of us if if if
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
if we're the ones that are on the losing
 
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
side if they want to uh uh write a
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
Minority Report that that's fine too um
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
so I guess um the other thing I'd like
 
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
to discuss is those I personally favor
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
the bill particularly um with the
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
amendment uh made by offered by
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
representative katab but I guess what
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
throw out for discussion is this for
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
those who don't favor it I'm wondering
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
is I mean this would I think help uh
 
00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
help our discussion is is your position
 
00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:41.959 align:start position:0%
sort of absolute we just don't think
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
that there should be any provision for
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
costs under any circumstances or are
 
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
there you know is there room for
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
allowing costs in some circumstance
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
because I think that might that might
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
make a difference to those of us who who
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
who favor it um at least personally I
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
would be open
 
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not saying it has to be the
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
way the the uh representative cutab has
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
it or nothing um so that's so I throw it
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
open to
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
discussion so if I understand you you
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
want discussion first before we take a
 
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
straw V right if we could
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
yeah um so represent representative L um
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
andw thank you Mr chair
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
even though this bill is well
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
intended and I totally understand it I
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
am totally against it we are taking away
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
the rights of our citizens whether we
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
like it or not and far as I'm concerned
 
00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have that right I have
 
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.310 align:start position:0%
we don't have that right I have
had

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
numerous times with especially my school
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
district I have had to ask for
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
information under right to know no I
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
have a right to no request in my school
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
district right
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
now and because the law says I can ask
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
for it under a different law because
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
it's transfer of
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
funds it may take over 10 hours and do
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
you mean the school district is may have
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
the right to charge me for it because
 
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:24.519 align:start position:0%
the law at tells me I can ask for this
 
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
information if Government any of it was
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
100 100%
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
honest and
 
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
transparent we wouldn't be have this
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
problem today now as far as records go
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
I've been around for a long time I've
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
been in office work all my life I know
 
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0%
how things pretty well work I've been in
 
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
state government I've been in County
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
government working and I know how things
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
work one person may take 10 hours to
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
find something another person may take
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
two hours to find something why is it
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
right to
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
charge a person a citizen if somebody
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
just takes longer then we have a
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
position in some of our towns and
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
municipalities and cities etc etc I
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
don't like you so I'm going to charge
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
you more I'm going to take more time or
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
oh I like you so I'm not going to charge
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
you so much we have a problem there then
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
there's something I looked up this
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
morning I happen to think
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
of there is a records retention law in
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
the state of New
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in that
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
list it tells every record every
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
municipality every agency that needs to
 
00:16:52.309 --> 00:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
keep on
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
record now if everybody doesn't follow
 
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.470 align:start position:0%
record now if everybody doesn't follow
this

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.230 align:start position:0%
this
law

00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
and keeps everything in order like it
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
should be because some records you don't
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
have to keep forever some records you
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
have to retain permanently if you can't
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
keep these laws in order and you have to
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
hunt and hunt for information
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
something's wrong and that's not the
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
citizens fault so like I said even
 
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
though this bill is well intentioned I
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
will definitely vote against
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:35.559 align:start position:0%
top thank you Mr chair um so I just
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
having taxpayers subsidize one
 
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
person's fishing Expedition
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
or a
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
business's ploy to get information
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to financially benefit
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
them I just don't think it's fiscally
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
responsible and you know I
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
think we need to consider that a lot of
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
towns are are paying attorneys to redact
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
many of these requests we're not talking
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
about getting meeting minutes and that
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff that should of course
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
always be available it's available on
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
many of the town's web page what we're
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
really talking about here is the
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
requests that are for multiple emails
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
for a significant period of time back
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
and I think similar to what rip Andrews
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
was talking about about records
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
retention there's nothing in there that
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
actually lists that you even need to
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
keep emails so do we want the towns to
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
turn to having no other recourse but to
 
00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
just start deleting emails um I
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
certainly don't think that that's you
 
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
know what we're wanting here and I I
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
just think you know the Constitution
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
does say that we shall not unreasonably
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
restrict and I think unreasonably
 
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
restrict is the key key word here
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
because nothing in the current statute
 
00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:57.799 align:start position:0%
defines what is reasonable nothing gives
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
any meth method of of pushing back if a
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
town doesn't feel that that's reasonable
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
sure that they can say I don't think
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
this is reasonable and the person can
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
just say well I want it anyway and the
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
town's forced to do it this is giving 10
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
free hours in a month I think if you get
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
your 10 hours of records and you want
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
more you could wait another month give
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
somebody else a turn to get their
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
records that they may need as well so
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
for that reason I'm going to be
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
supporting the Bill thank
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
you other other comments uh yes
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank thank you Mr
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
chair as the chairman well
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
knows um we sometimes find ourselves in
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch with frivolous
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and they are a nuisance and
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
they take time and they get in the
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
way but they're not all that many of
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
them and to and it's always within the
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
power of the core cour to get rid of a
 
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.230 align:start position:0%
power of the core cour to get rid of a
frivolous

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
frivolous
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuit it's a small price to pay to
 
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
maintain democracy small D
 
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
democracy uh I believe the
 
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.510 align:start position:0%
democracy uh I believe the
[Music]

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
same rubric
 
00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
applies in this case I had a long
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
conversation with my Town
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
Administrator and as asked him about
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
what the problems were with right to
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
know in
 
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.789 align:start position:0%
know in
dur

00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
dur
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
and he said uh every now and then we do
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
get somebody who is orary just for
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
the enjoyment of being orary he said but
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
if the town government recognizes the
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
Public's right to
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
know right to know then there's so many
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
ways to handle it um someone writes and
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
says I need every piece of
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
Correspondence that you have on such and
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
such going back since um Adam and
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
Eve and so what you do is you pick up
 
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
the phone and you call and
 
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
say what do you really what do you
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
really want let me know what you really
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
want let's see if we can figure out how
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
we can do this and it turns out he
 
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
really wants a particular letter or a
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
group of uh letters that communicate
 
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
about something and then the answer is
 
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
sure come on
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
down and um and we'll get those for you
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
if you assume good
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
faith until in the rare situation you
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
find find out that it is not good
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
faith you can accomplish an awful
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
lot I I think that right to know doesn't
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
have the system in the state doesn't
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
have everything down perfectly nothing
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
we do is perfect it's one of the reasons
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
that we created the udman to see for a
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
limited period of time to see if that is
 
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.590 align:start position:0%
limited period of time to see if that is
helpful

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
but I believe very strongly that Our
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
obligation is to make sure that citizens
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
are able to get all the
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
information that they can
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
reasonably expect obviously not
 
00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
violating certain
 
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that can't be uh altered
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
and that a system that puts a price on
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
it is on its face
 
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
discriminatory it is going to on its
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
face hurt people at the lowest end of
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
the income
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
scale um it is going to set up different
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
classes of people as to whether or not
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
you're entitled to get
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
information and we know that we could
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
charge a lot and big commercial entities
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
aren't going to care at all they can pay
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
whatever but I'm not concerned about
 
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
them I'm concerned about the individual
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
and that is why I feel very strongly um
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
that while we always can look for ways
 
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
to improve right to know this is not the
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
way thank you any other other comments
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh representative tur first and
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
Stapleton um yeah thanks Mr chair I I
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to speak in in favor of this
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
um some of the things have been
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned already and I totally
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
differential to um the comments that
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
were made by people who have done this
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
for a lot longer than I have just now um
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
both reps Andress and and Smith um I as
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
as as many often happens it feels like
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
this is you know a response to something
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
that's sort of becoming a grow
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
tactic if I'll call it you know very
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
often there are things that are very
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
good things until until some folks
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
decide that they want to start using
 
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
them a different way and and uh I don't
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
think this will completely solve that
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
problem um I feel like from what we
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
heard from the gathered statistics on
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
this there would be very
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
few cases that would fall into this
 
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
because the 10hour threshold is rarely
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
exceeded um and I feel as though the um
 
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
there are two purposes really if this
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
were to happen one is the the the
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
associated cost would for I think hope
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
bring people to to think more about the
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
limits of what they're asking for um the
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
the the really difficult ones that I've
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
seen are very open-ended it's all
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
Communications across multiple you know
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
boards and committees um you know and
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that sort of don't
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
seem to have a purpose but seem to be
 
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
use those are the ones that take you
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
know hundreds and hundreds of pages and
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
you know someone has to redact them um
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
and it also to to compensate so so both
 
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
to cause people to think and also to
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
limit the time um and you know again I
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
think we we'll discuss today maybe a
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
bill that might also further limit the
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
amount of time that's needed if you
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
could if if towns are producing things
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
that are already electronically in
 
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
electronic format could further limit
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
the amount of time uh that's needed and
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I feel feel like there is an out um
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman um to basically make sure that
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
the types of abuses where where uh a
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
town might just claim a very very large
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
amount of time would be um would be
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
dealt with through that process so um
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
that's my thoughts thank you
 
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.070 align:start position:0%
that's my thoughts thank you
representative

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair um
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative Smith touched upon a
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
golden Point
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.430 align:start position:0%
golden Point
communication

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
communication much preferable than
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
loggerheads and um my thought is that if
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh we had the 10hour and monetary
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
factors that would be a very much of an
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
incentive for people to communicate and
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
say what do you really want because if
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
we go over a limit and you want
 
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
everything in the world then it could be
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
costly and it sets people back back to
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
think communication and thinking I view
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
this bill as a balancing between the
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
right to know um citizens in democracy
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
wanting to know what's going on in
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
government and the the protecting
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
communities especially small communities
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities from outrageous costs I
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
know in Claremont we had a couple of
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
issues that went to attorneys in 201
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
$225,000 worth of uh attorney time
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
investigating and letters and expunging
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
personal information and so on and so
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
forth um just tremendously costly and I
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
think this bill represents a balancing
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
effect um and and I think it's
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
positive other other comments Mr yes
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
representative G
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you for taking my question
 
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
we've had four days to study this bill
 
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.310 align:start position:0%
we've had four days to study this bill
um

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
we took it on
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
um on
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
the 17th and today's the 22nd 7 and four
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
is 12 yeah that's so four four days for
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
me that's really not enough time uh this
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
bill is really complex um my initial
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
take on it is I would want to go itail
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
on it because there's too much here and
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough time to really mes
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
out you know all the issues
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
so that's my thought thank you you know
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry other yes representative Smith
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
I could just uh add one comment bad
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
cases make bad law um I think the
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
municipal Association itself gave us
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
material which show that
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly requests are um
 
00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
are of
 
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.230 align:start position:0%
are of
modest

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
modest
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
import um it is the um
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
outlier uh that seems to get people um
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
concerned enough in order to want to
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
move with this bill those are in the
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
minority I continue to believe that if
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
public employees were familiar with more
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
so perhaps than they are with the best
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
way to keep records with their
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
obligations under right to know and
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that someone asking for
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
something isn't the
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
enemy the person asking
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
is is new is a neutral force and should
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
be viewed as a neutral Force until
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
something happens that makes you
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
understand that it's not and in order to
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
protect the overwhelm Welling majority
 
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
of the citizens of the state and honor a
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
commitment to right to know recognize
 
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.389 align:start position:0%
commitment to right to know recognize
that

00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
secrecy as compared with
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
transparency is not actually the best
 
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
way to function in a
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
democracy um I think the bill is an
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
example of a bad case making a bad law
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I I obviously don't want to belabor
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
the point anymore but I hope we would
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
focus our attention
 
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
on the problems that
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
affect significantly more of the people
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
in this state than the few outliers who
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
might be abusing the system thank you
 
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519 align:start position:0%
other comments so I guess that that I I
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
just want to make um one uh one sort of
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
final uh comment on this um I I think I
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
I I largely agree with the sentiments
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
that have been expressed by everyone the
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
one thing where I would I think disagree
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
with the ranking member is I do think I
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
mean I agree that most of the requests
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
there isn't any problem and that's not
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
what this bill is is aimed at but I
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
agree with representative tur that there
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
and I think we've seen
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
increasing examples of this that there
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
are are people who are just out to abuse
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
the system who believe you know who have
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
these kind of conspiracy theories and
 
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
and please don't misunderstand me I'm
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
not saying that there that some of the
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
things that representative Andress
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out are there some small towns
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
where you know there is a click and
 
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
there's some favorites and non-f
 
00:31:49.389 --> 00:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
favorites I'm sure that's true but as a
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
general proposition you know I are my
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
sense is that the people public servants
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
are generally pretty good people who are
 
00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
out who are trying to do the right thing
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
and just as I as I think all the people
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
around this table fit into that category
 
00:32:07.629 --> 00:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
um and um unfortunately there are some
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
people who have this uh mindset that
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
let's let's see if we can screw up the
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
works uh in some way by asking for
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
everything making and of course the
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
result of that is that um the taxpayers
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
all of us end up paying because
 
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:26.519 align:start position:0%
Municipal Employees or state employees
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
who should be doing other things that
 
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:30.919 align:start position:0%
we're paying them for are instead
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
involved in in uh
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh responding to these requests and as I
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
think we've heard from the the evidence
 
00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
here the the best example of that is one
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
the witness who indicated that you know
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
they're they have a they have so many of
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
these things for large volumes of
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
information that they've they've spent
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
in in ordinate amount of time Gathering
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
and the people haven't even bothered to
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
come and pick it up um which I think
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
demonstrates um what you know what the
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
intent is in many of those cases the
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
last thing I'll say is and I this this
 
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
goes back well over 30 years but I I use
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
this as an example of the fact that in
 
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
some circumstances you know having
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
requiring people to have a little skin
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
in the game really does matter when I
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
was in the US attorney's office in
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
Boston I had this big uh fraud mortgage
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
fraud case and was in uh the early 90s
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
and I think we indicted about 10
 
00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
defendants nine of them were people that
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
were you know very well off financially
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
and could afford to hire their own
 
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
lawyers and they did one of them was who
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
was sort of the one of the low low rung
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
people that was charged um was not able
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
to afford a lawyer and he ended up with
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
the federal public
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
defender in the course of Discovery uh
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
there was a there were lots and lots of
 
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
documents as you might imagine in a case
 
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
like this the nine lawyers who were rep
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
the nine defendants who were represented
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
by in by private councel who were going
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
to have to pay for their their
 
00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:06.919 align:start position:0%
attorney's time all of them
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
made extensive but very reasonable
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
records requests about what they wanted
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
from the government's files that had
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
some bearing that were reasonably had
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
some bearing on what could be relevant
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
in the case but the one who had a public
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
defender just said I want everything I
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
want every scrap of paper uh whether it
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
it would have any potential relevance or
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
not and and why because they weren't
 
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
going to pay for it and what and it was
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
it was very obvious to me that they were
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
never going to look at at any of the
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
much of the stuff that theyve they asked
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
for that had really you know little or
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
no relevance and they knew that too but
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
if you're if there's no skin in the game
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't cost you a dime why not
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
ask for it um and I use that as an
 
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
example because and of course we gave it
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
to them they were you know they were
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
entitled to it under the under the rules
 
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
and of course we we spent a lot of time
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
and gave it to them um but that's just
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
an example of and I of of when it makes
 
00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
sense to require people to have some
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
skin in the game and I think this
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
amendment with particularly with
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative kav's Amendment this does
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
strike that balance it doesn't say that
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know for most of the people that
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Smith talked about um who
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
are who making requests that U they're
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to be they're going to be charged
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be you know
 
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
discouraged from uh from uh making
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
requests but it does it does it seems to
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
me say that um when that if you really
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
are making a request that's going to
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
have uh a significant impact on the on
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
the time and commitments of public
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
employees and a significant cost to the
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh then you you have to have
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
some skin in the game um and and it
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the that what is
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
requested here is not at all
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and I would note and I I
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
very much thank uh uh attorney biset
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
from the ACLU for providing information
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
information to us it should be noted
 
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
that many many other states we if we
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
adopt this requirement we're not in any
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
way out of the mainstream many many
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
other states have requirements that uh
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
that there of some it's it's in a
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
variety of different forms but
 
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
many other states have have uh
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
Provisions uh calling for payment um in
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
some circumstances and I I think this is
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
a very uh reasonable request um so with
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
that um uh it sounds like I I guess from
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
what I've heard from all the comments it
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like those who are opposed to
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
this um are not nobody has suggested
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
well if we if we um if we just amended
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
it in this way or that way it might be
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
so I take it that those who are opposed
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
are just opposed and uh and so with that
 
00:37:02.109 --> 00:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'd like to ask is um a
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
straw vote first um who would support
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
this if you support this bill with
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative Cab's amendment can I
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
please so 12 those opposed raise your
 
00:37:20.359 --> 00:37:24.309 align:start position:0%
please so 12 those opposed raise your
hand

00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
what's that oh that's that's the other
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's the other this is enabling
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't it's not a
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
requirement uh no Town had would be
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
required to do this all right so it
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
looks like then the uh the ought to pass
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
as amended is in the majority and so for
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
that reason um I'm going to uh rep uh
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
motion I move you have to go on the
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
amendment first
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
right uh otpa on Amendment 2024 d01
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
97h right uh represent I recognize
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton for a second
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
right all right it's been moved and
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
seconded U representative katab is there
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
anything you want
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
to talk if you want to speak to this
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
motion beyond what we've already said
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
please do
 
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
so um so this amendment um does add in
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
that if a party feels that the estimated
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
number of hours or costs to make the
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
record available is unreasonable that
 
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
they may go to the on budsman for
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
determination rather it's reasonable and
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
it does correct to say that it would
 
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
only be charged in hours of excess of 10
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
hours so that's that's all all right any
 
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on this uh
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment not seeing no one I uh Mr oh
 
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry okay one of the things
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
about um people going to the Ombudsman
 
00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
there's a charge for that that's
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
service okay all right any other other
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
comments all right then I guess we're
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
ready for a vote on the uh this will be
 
00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
a vote on the amendment ask uh just to
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
show hands on that can we do can we do
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
it with that all right so all right so
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
then uh all those in favor of uh of
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
Representative kav's Amendment please

and Andress for the minority all right
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.550 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
all right all right so then let me uh
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
turn to
 
00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
um uh House Bill
 
00:41:38.599 --> 00:41:41.870 align:start position:0%
um uh House Bill
1069

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
um there is uh again I I I want to have
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
at least a brief discussion about this
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
because based on my uh my discussion
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
with uh the r ranking member um it
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
appears that my understanding is that
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
that some people may may feel that
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
there's a little confusion and maybe
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's true and that and that perhaps
 
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.230 align:start position:0%
that's true and that and that perhaps
more

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
time uh to consider this would be in
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
order and let me let me sort of say what
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
what um what I tried to do I have an
 
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
amendment um that was based upon uh my
 
00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
discussion based upon what I heard at
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing and my discussions uh with
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford who was a
 
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor um and what I what I tried to
 
00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
1069 the all the the the matters that
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
were raised that I that I thought were
 
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.510 align:start position:0%
were raised that I that I thought were
valid

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
valid
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
points and cover both cover in 1069
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
9 all of the issues that were addressed
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
in both uh H HB 1069 and 1696 to put
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
them all in one bill so that if we were
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
to pass 1069 with the amendment we could
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
then itl 69 1696 because it wouldn't do
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
anything um and so that's what I tried
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
to do um but if so I guess my first
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
question would be
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh do people think that they need more
 
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
time to consider this and if that's the
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
case you know I we I'm happy to say
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
let's let's defer this and we'll we'll
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh we'll deal with it we'll deal with it
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
in the next executive session so if
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
somebody feels that way I'm certainly
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
happy to let's let's talk about
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
it representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
chair um representative Kenny and I have
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment to 1696 that just
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
incorporates the concerns from the ACLU
 
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
so we can move forward with that one if
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
you'd prefer and then deal with the
 
00:43:57.549 --> 00:43:57.559 align:start position:0%
other one when it's up to you but I just
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you that option as well
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
on the table okay um all right well so
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
but but I mean you would be prepared to
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
move forward with that then today is
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
that is that
 
00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
correct um 1696 yes okay
 
00:44:14.359 --> 00:44:17.230 align:start position:0%
correct um 1696 yes okay
unless

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
unless
 
00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:19.559 align:start position:0%
there as long as we're holding on to one
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
of them I think that's fine we're
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
prepared to move forward with right
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
right right that would be the issue so
 
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
so I guess again I if if there's anybody
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
that thinks that we should not exec this
 
00:44:33.549 --> 00:44:33.559 align:start position:0%
today and give it more you know either
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
either of these two bills today and give
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
it more time uh I'm certainly open to
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
doing that um but but you know if but if
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
not if there really isn't any any
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
concern and we can we could just move
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
forward um you know the speaker the
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
speaker would like to have as many uh as
 
00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:52.559 align:start position:0%
many bills to to be voted on on the
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
floor as quickly as possible and I think
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
that is a valid point so
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm not seeing anybody saying we need
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
more time representative tur yeah I I
 
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what um representative
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
Alexander's Amendment would or wouldn't
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
do um I guess my problem was the idea of
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
pushing both of these together into the
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
same bill um because personally I feel
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
differently on 1069 and
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
1696 um and the changes that came in
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
your Amendment um didn't just bring in
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
the language from the other bill they
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
also brought in a lot of other content
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
and so I wasn't sure where that would
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
leave this bill if uh we didn't spend
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
more time because it feels like there
 
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
isn't a version of it that at least from
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
my perspective I'm comfortable with
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
because it it sort of is bringing two
 
00:45:47.309 --> 00:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
very different issues together under one
 
00:45:47.319 --> 00:45:48.270 align:start position:0%
very different issues together under one
One

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
One
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
Umbrella okay um yes representative
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
Kenny thank you Mr chair uh so like
 
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander said uh we do
 
00:45:59.790 --> 00:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
have an amendment PR prepared for 1696
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
um and I do agree with that Amendment
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
but like representative tur just said um
 
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
some people may feel one way about um
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
one of these bills and not the other and
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
although I understand what the amendment
 
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
is trying to do to merge them I think if
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
we wait on one we should wait on both um
 
00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:19.319 align:start position:0%
just so people can have enough time um
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
to consider and um think about these
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
separately and together thank you no
 
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
that's all right so so let me ask you
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
let me put it let me put it this way uh
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
we've had at least two people have
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
spoken in uh have suggested that it
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
would that there would be some benefit
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
to waiting um does anybody have an OP is
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed to us deferring action
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
on these two bills until you know until
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
another another executive session
 
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.510 align:start position:0%
another another executive session
representative

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
Stapleton I like the way the two came
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
together and uh I would support moving
 
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.630 align:start position:0%
together and uh I would support moving
it

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
Forward right um let me ask okay let
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
well in the in the interest of trying to
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
come to an bipartisan uh result here can
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
I just ask how many if if you if you
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
favor moving forward now without delay
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
without putting it off to another time
 
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
can I ask you to raise your hand please
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
can I ask a clarifying question if we're
 
00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:17.559 align:start position:0%
moving forward with 1069 does that mean
 
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
that we could still hold 1696 if
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to sure so we other words
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
I I suppose we what what I had thought
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
was if we did 1069 with the Amendments I
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
had proposed there would be no need for
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
1696 because we would have addressed
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
that issue and so my thought was we
 
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
would we if we passed 1069 with with the
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
amendment otpa then the logical thing to
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
do would be to itl 1696 but we don't
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
have to do that we could otpa
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
1069 and leave and and uh just not take
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
any action on
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
1696 leave that so that it would be open
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
for you know for another amendment or do
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
so later I I don't have any problem with
 
00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839 align:start position:0%
that um but it sounds like
 
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
representative tur and representative
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
Kenny are saying that it it might make
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
more sense to just not do it today so
 
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
that everybody has a better has more
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
time to think about it and I'm not I'm
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
not opposed to that either but uh and it
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
sounded like from when I when I asked
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
people to raise their hands that there
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
was only a few people who thought we
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
should move forward today but let me ask
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
again if you fa if you think we should
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
move forward today on these two bills
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
hand all right so I
 
00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.630 align:start position:0%
hand all right so I
only

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
well I so all right so I guess what I'm
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
going to do then is say let's not move
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
forward on either 1069 or
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
1696 and we'll take that up at the the
 
00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
um at uh at our next executive session
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
which I want to talk about before we
 
00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:05.559 align:start position:0%
leave today um then let me next turn to
 
00:49:05.559 --> 00:49:07.309 align:start position:0%
leave today um then let me next turn to
uh

00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
103 uh that's the uh Bill uh regarding
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
name changes uh for uh prisoners and I
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
understand there's an amendment um by
 
00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.079 align:start position:0%
representative kutab so I'm going to
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:32.799 align:start position:0%
d205 is there a second yeah me Mr chair
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
all right moved in seconded uh
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative katab we wish to speak to
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
Alexander representative katab you wish
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment so the amendment simply added
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
a few of the
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh convictions that were missing that
 
00:49:56.589 --> 00:49:56.599 align:start position:0%
were pointed out by the Coalition of
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
domestic violence um and it also adds in
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
that before the Probate Court May Grant
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
a name
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
change that a reasonable effort should
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
be made by the initial Prosecuting
 
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
District to notify the victim and that
 
00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
it all right anyone else wish to be
 
00:50:28.589 --> 00:50:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no one um so I guess
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
we're ready then for a vote on the
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
amendment and it's amendment
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
0205 is that correct yeah do we want do
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
that sure I can do I think we can do
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
that by hand um so uh all those in favor
 
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
hand it seems appears to be uh we have
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
one missing I guess so
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh 19 19
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
20 right right we have representative
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
gon missing so I think it's 190 so it's
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
19 z um all right so that passes and
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
we're on to uh the the bill uh as
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
amended otpa uh anyone wish to speak uh
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
on the bill as amended seeing none I'd

you all right
 
00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:42.799 align:start position:0%
um all right the next one
 
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
um on our agenda is uh
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
2004 which is to uh repeal the judicial
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
conduct commission uh
 
00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.309 --> 00:53:03.319 align:start position:0%
um again I'm going to recognize
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative katab uh or uh that bill
 
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
I move
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
OTP is there a second I will
 
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
second um representative kab do you wish
 
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
motion so this is just simply seeking to
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
clean up the books on something that
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
cannot be used it was deemed
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional I understand why many
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
parties want to be able to use it but I
 
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
I do think it's a you know a 73a issue
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
where if something like this were to be
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
used then the proper way to do this
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
would we we would need a constitutional
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and so right now there is a
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
Judicial conduct committee that's part
 
00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
of the court and this is repealing the
 
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
statutory commission they both have very
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
similar names abbreviated JCC I think
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
it's really confusing especially to
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
prosay parties that perhaps want to make
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
a complaint about a judge they go to
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
look up the process they find this on
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
the books they don't realize that it's
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
not used I think that's incredibly
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
confusing and so I think it makes sense
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
to clean up the books again it was it
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
was deemed unconstitutional 20 years ago
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
so I think it's it's been sitting on
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
there long enough not used that we
 
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
should go ahead and take care of it
 
00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:26.839 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on uh on
 
00:54:26.839 --> 00:54:28.150 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on uh on
this

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
bill all right then I guess we're ready
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh for um a roll call on it uh the
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass on uh repealing
 
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:40.760 align:start position:0%

don't see any reason why it could
not

00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%

May to Shell is that correct that's
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%

Smith hello

Smith hello
everybody

00:57:35.549 --> 00:57:35.559 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
um as you know for a number of reasons a
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
special committee on the Family Court um
 
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
was formed with five members of the
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
judici Judiciary Committee and five
 
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
members of um children and family law we
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
were focusing only on the Family Court a
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
part of the Circuit Court we weren't
 
00:57:58.589 --> 00:57:58.599 align:start position:0%
focusing on um the Superior or the
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court but we will move to form a
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
special committee looking at education
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
training and
 
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
accountability and um we came to realize
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
that for many many reasons and I can
 
00:58:20.029 --> 00:58:20.039 align:start position:0%
discuss a few of the most significant um
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
it was very hard for members of the
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
judicial AR to get access to the
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
training that they that everyone
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
understood they needed one of the
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
reasons is um they didn't have enough uh
 
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
time because the judges um are in the
 
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
court all the time in the Family Court
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
they have no no attorneys they have no
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
staff assistance so they're doing both
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
judicial work and what I would call
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
judicial administrative work um there is
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
no uh there's very very limited money um
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
available for any training there is no
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
possibility of having uh scheduling
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
controlled in such a way to provide
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable access to time time is always
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
the most difficult of all to control and
 
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
um the result is that that
 
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um came to realize that the
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has an
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
obligation to make it possible for the
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
courts to do what they would like to do
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
what they know is necessary but they
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
need some support from the the
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
legislative branch and
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
um therefore the answer is
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes there is a a problem in ter not
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily because of lack of will but
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
lack of time and resources on the part
 
01:00:08.109 --> 01:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch and we can help
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
make it possible without violating 73a
 
01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:16.839 align:start position:0%
without the legislature taking over um
 
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities that belong in the
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
courts to nonetheless make it possible
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
for the judges to do a better job
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
meeting the needs to decisions of the
 
01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
state and that is why um uh I and and
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
others support this legislation with the
 
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to um emphasize its
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
importance so does that does that it it
 
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:46.839 align:start position:0%
does answer my question I
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
guess when you mentioned the 73a we just
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
passed a bill that repealed legislator
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
accountability and now we're passing a
 
01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
bill that adds more legislature
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
accountability I guess I'm like I'm
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
going to vote for the bill it answers
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
the question but I guess I'm I'm
 
01:01:04.029 --> 01:01:04.039 align:start position:0%
confused why we're we shouldn't have a
 
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
position then we should have a position
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander to help me
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
understand why this bill is increasing
 
01:01:12.319 --> 01:01:13.950 align:start position:0%
understand why this bill is increasing
legislative

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
accountability um uh I the court has no
 
01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
Authority on its own to uh uh
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
to ra to to
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
fund the branch the legislature is
 
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for that um it is one
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
example of how the branches work
 
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
together this is setting a
 
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.230 align:start position:0%
together this is setting a
policy

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
um that falls within our Province uh to
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
um in in terms of of Staffing and
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
funding and that's what that is what
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
this what the uh chief justice does um
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
you know is up to him and um we're not
 
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799 align:start position:0%
stepping on his toes I did have a long
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
conversation with uh the chief uh last
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
either Thursday afternoon or Friday
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
morning um uh to clarify some
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings that he had about what
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
we would doing and I believe that he was
 
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.829 align:start position:0%
we would doing and I believe that he was
quite

01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
quite
 
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable um at the end of that
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
conversation as was I with the out come
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
I I'm not trying to belabor this but
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
we're saying they shall complete
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
training we're not just giving them
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
$156,000 to hire a coordinator than they
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
they determine the training we're
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
telling them how much training to have
 
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
so in one lock in one one bill we're
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
repealing something so that they have
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
more control
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
over that conduct commission and then in
 
01:03:05.269 --> 01:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
another breath we're creating a position
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
so that we can then tell them how much
 
01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
training they must have that is that is
 
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
my issue I'm going to vote for the bill
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
and support the bill I guess I'm just
 
01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
trying to bring that point up I I hear
 
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and I think it's it's
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
quite it's quite a valuable Point very
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
clearly we are not saying anyway what
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
that training will be who is to perform
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
the training what the substance of the
 
01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
training is we leave it to the court to
 
01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
saying it's okay for you to take those
 
01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:45.990 align:start position:0%
saying it's okay for you to take those
the

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
judges from the
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
bench for a limit and others it's not
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
just the judges it's other staff um in
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
order to do what you the court want to
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
do and we will fulfill Our obligation
 
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
although it's not in this bill um but
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
it's something of a moral obligation to
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that when the finance
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
committee gets the budget that we
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
support the efforts of the Supreme Court
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
position all right any other any other
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh comment yes representative staple
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
I don't see anywhere in the bill that it
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
prescribes U methods
 
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
or curriculum of instruction and that's
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
what's up to the
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
coordinator who will be
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with the craft and um I can
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
only relate similarly to the insurance
 
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
business where we had to do 24 hours of
 
01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.710 align:start position:0%
business where we had to do 24 hours of
continuing

01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
education three four or five credit
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
credits of which had to be ethics and
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
but it was specialized um and in
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
commercial um liability and property um
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
the the the online courses were
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
specially tailored to the the licensed
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
requirements of the State of New
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um I believe that that
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
possibility is open here the coordinator
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
may have a number of resources to
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
utilize and Marshall the best uh
 
01:05:23.599 --> 01:05:24.870 align:start position:0%
utilize and Marshall the best uh
curricular

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
curricular
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
to fit the need here I'm entirely
 
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the way the bill is
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
written yes representative Alexander
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the way I'm reading
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment and maybe it's a drafting
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
error at ol I don't know but I'm reading
 
01:05:38.079 --> 01:05:39.230 align:start position:0%
error at ol I don't know but I'm reading
it

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
as line seven the minimum initial
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
training for judges shall be as follows
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
and then it tells them orientation for
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
new judges on procedures and function of
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
the Court education for new judges on
 
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
legal subjects practical skills needed
 
01:05:56.029 --> 01:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
at least one hour of training devoted to
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
topics of legal judicial ethics
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
professionalism preventing implicit bias
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
mental health domestic violence are we
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
telling them what they should learn or
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
not because I was just told we're not
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
but then the way the Amendments drafted
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
we're telling them what they need to be
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
trained on I think I think the the what
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
we're telling them is sort of the
 
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
general areas in other words the the
 
01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
um this you know I'm always I'm always
 
01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
sort of uh to some extent um uh Curious
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
when this the the because the issue is
 
01:06:30.839 --> 01:06:32.510 align:start position:0%
when this the the because the issue is
raised

01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
raised
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes I think really
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
inappropriately by by uh uh the judicial
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
branch or its spokesman not I'm not
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this has happened
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
recently at all I don't mean to suggest
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
that but in the past there was a view I
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
think on uh some people that uh the
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
court had
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
some uh special uh separation of powers
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility so the legislature really
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't do anything uh or almost
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
anything uh relating to uh the details
 
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
of Court operations uh because it was a
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
somehow could be a violation of
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
separation of powers because it was one
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
branch telling the other and usually
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
completely absent from any of those
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
discussions was the fact that the
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
legislature has done exactly that with
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
the executive branch um I uh uh in in
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
whatever areas it came up and so uh
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
finally there this uh there was a um a
 
01:07:33.309 --> 01:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
decision I'm happy to say that I wrote
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
it I when I just coincidentally that
 
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
attempted to uh and it was a unanimous
 
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
decision that attempted to sort of make
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
it clear that the the legislature would
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
cross the line only if it interfered
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
with the uh the the essential judicial
 
01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.710 align:start position:0%
with the uh the the essential judicial
function

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh essential judicial functions of
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
adjudicating cases and so this um you
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
know I I guess I would
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
agree that if that there would be some
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
point at which the leg the legislature
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
would go too far not only with the
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
judicial branch but with the Executive
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
Branch if it really tried to micromanage
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
training but simply saying what the
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
level of training must be that there
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
must be 12 hours or or 24 hours whatever
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh the general topics that need to be
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
covered um I don't that that is
 
01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature has done
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
for the executive branch in many in many
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
with many agencies um and so I don't see
 
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
that at at any as any problem at all um
 
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't in any way interfere with how
 
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
courts decide individual cases or what
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh what law they must apply in
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
individual cases so I don't see any any
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh separation of powers violation here
 
01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
at all and I agree with representative
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
Smith and I and uh and representative
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
Cab's uh point that it's it certainly
 
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:07.910 align:start position:0%
Cab's uh point that it's it certainly
was

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
true during the time that I was in the
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and I think given the
 
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
what's what happened with covid and
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
those kind of things I'm sure it's even
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
more true today that
 
01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:20.950 align:start position:0%
more true today that
um

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
training um was always something
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
something that there was because there
 
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
was not a particular person assigned
 
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:09:30.669 --> 01:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility it was always something
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
that the court tried I think the courts
 
01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:34.759 align:start position:0%
very at the various levels tried to do
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
their best to provide training but it
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
was always something that um you know
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
was not there was nobody specifically
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
designed to to do that and so it
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
it when it when it was my responsibility
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
to do that it was something that you
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
know we but we got to do this training
 
01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
let's let's let's get somebody to do it
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
and and uh you know and it was sort of
 
01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc kind of thing which is really
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
not the best way for that to happen I
 
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
think the having a training coordinator
 
01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
will be a very positive uh positive
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
thing representative trip
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh I believe I have to agree with rep
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
Alexander that there's a there's a
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
wording problem on uh line seven and
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
eight uh the first section talks about
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
initial training for uh uh for new hires
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
where the uh the line eight talks about
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
minimum initial training for the judges
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
I I believe what it should be saying is
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
judges

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
judges
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
yes oh so it it actually is right
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
because it then says that like it's
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
because this amendment is only changing
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
the shell pieces and so the paragraphs
 
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
that didn't say shell aren't in here but
 
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
if you compare the two together it does
 
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
underneath of the initial training it
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
then says orientation for new judges on
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
procedures and functions of the
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
applicable court and relevant procedural
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
and subst of law um so it it lists
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
several things and then the next
 
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph um is any person who holds a
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
position of Judge Court Administrator so
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
it it does make sense actually it's just
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
it some of the paragraphs were changed
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
and some weren't so when they are merged
 
01:11:59.950 --> 01:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
back together the language would make
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
sense other other
 
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
comments All right so um seeing none I
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
guess we're ready uh first for a vote on
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment and I can do that by
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
show of hands I ask all those in favor
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
of uh Amendment 0
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
20241 93h please raise your
 
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.510 align:start position:0%
20241 93h please raise your
hand

01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
uh appears to be 19 to0 all
 
01:12:31.709 --> 01:12:31.719 align:start position:0%
right um then any further discussion on
 
01:12:33.629 --> 01:12:33.639 align:start position:0%

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%

to1 go on
 
01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
consent all right consent uh oh wait a
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
minute no no this is this I think I
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
think it has to go this is a this is
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
going to go to a second committee
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
there's a fiscal note so it probably
 
01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
can't go going to a second it yeah it is
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
your saying that there's AIS doesn't
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily right no I'm let me see yeah
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
it's on it's an early Bill unfortunately
 
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
okay um so it can't go on consent yes it
 
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
can oh because because fiscal I think it
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's yeah I can't go on consent okay
 
01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.870 align:start position:0%
that's yeah I can't go on consent okay
so

01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.790 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
0193 um and um representative trip could
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%

um what I hb1 1274 which what I have
 
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
referred to as the judicial cleanup bill

um uh
and

01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:57.639 --> 01:15:01.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
second so
 
01:15:09.149 --> 01:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
um representative uh I have an amendment
 
01:15:09.159 --> 01:15:10.750 align:start position:0%
um representative uh I have an amendment
um

01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
0180 which
 
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
adds um the
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh move moves uh from 75,000 to 100,000
 
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
the um the the uh ability of the
 
01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
judicial branch to make Interline
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
transfers doesn't change the budget at
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
all but it make it increases that amount
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
from 75,000 to 100,000 I
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
as as I
 
01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
recall uh from the hearing U the this
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
this change to 100,000 was made on a for
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
a number of other you know in another
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
number of other parts of the budget and
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
for some reason it didn't get I think
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
just an oversight it didn't get put in
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch one and so that's
 
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
what this change is for um but um before
 
01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
we get to V votes um representative
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
turer I understand you have another
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
amendment which would have if I
 
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
understand correctly
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
eliminated um the witness fees and
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
mileage section is that is that correct
 
01:16:18.629 --> 01:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
and can I ask you to speak to that just
 
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
for a minute sure I I passed it around
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's uh 0189 H um and yeah from from the
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
discussion in the
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the question was in that
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
section it
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
specifies um mileage amounts and and
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
other dollar amounts um that seemed out
 
01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
of step with the sort of current um
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement levels for those things
 
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
and and in the discussion um the council
 
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
basically said they're already paying
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
these rates they basically are are
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
authorized through another um section of
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
law to make the payments they just don't
 
01:17:02.629 --> 01:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
have guidance on what the payments
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
should be but they also seem to suggest
 
01:17:08.189 --> 01:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
that this is just the old language that
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
that was in place when this it seems
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
like potentially accidentally fell out
 
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
of an amendment to an to the RSA so it
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
felt as though there was no real reason
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
to put the wrong numbers back in statute
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
now if it's not
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
preventing the council from making the
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
payments the way they are anyway and
 
01:17:30.669 --> 01:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
that would provide the time to figure
 
01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
out what the right um amounts are and
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
and whether that actually is properly in
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
statute or or or dealt with through some
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
other mechanism Like rules so that was
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
my reason for for taking that out so so
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know what I I guess um uh
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
my I don't really have any problem with
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
what you what you suggest and and I
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
think you're my my understanding of of
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know the situation I think is the
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
same as yours the only question I have
 
01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
and I see a representative of the
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
judicial branch the back of the room is
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
um is if and I wonder if I just could
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
ask you to come up for a minute so I can
 
01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
we can just ask you a question if we
 
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
do what representative tur suggests that
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
is we simply remove the section of this
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
reinstated the Mage rate and witness fee
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
rates um as I understand it from the
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard even without this
 
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
language um in the in current law the
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
judicial branch is paying people at the
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
at this rate um under sort of General
 
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
Authority from another statute is is
 
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.229 align:start position:0%
Authority from another statute is is
that

01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
correct good morning Mr chairman uh eron
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
K and general counsel for the judicial
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
branch um I believe that the judicial
 
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
councel um or judicial Council I'm sorry
 
01:18:58.270 --> 01:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
yes does pay because they are obligated
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
to under another statute and so even
 
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
though the specific guidance of this
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
statute was repealed they are following
 
01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
it in the absence of more clear guidance
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
in order to comply with the Mandate of
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
another statute okay so if we if we do
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
what representative tur suggests that is
 
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
we just remove that language from Bill
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's not gonna there's not going to be
 
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
any problem as far as you're aware with
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
the with the judicial Council just
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
continuing to do what they've been doing
 
01:19:24.629 --> 01:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of right and then if
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
there's some need and then presumably
 
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
next year in the budget or whatever if
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
we if if it's thought that we should up
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
the witness fees and the mileage
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
allowance whatever we can do that next
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
year that is my understanding as well
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
sir okay all right so in with that um my
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
inclination is that representative tur's
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is a good one and we ought to
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
adopt that um does any but does anyone
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
else anyone have any other thoughts on
 
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
witness all right oh representative St
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%

amendments first I guess I'll move um my
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
um Amendment first which is where where
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
is it um my amendment is the one that
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
that changes the uh 75,000 to 100,00 and
 
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:33.560 align:start position:0%

Amendment

01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment

0180 please raise your hand if you're in
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
that looks like it's unanimous 19
 
01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:51.709 align:start position:0%
that looks like it's unanimous 19
to0

01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
um oh I'm sorry I need yes can I have a
 
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
second first on the
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
motion all right so I have
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh Wallace second
 
01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:12.790 align:start position:0%
representative uh Wallace second
um

01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
yes no it's it's I'm I'm sorry you know
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
what it no it's there was an
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
81h that was first sent around but that
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
was uh OS corrected that because they
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
hadn't um you'll see that
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
0180 H is a just a bit different in in
 
01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
that it um the effective date of another
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
section was not included in the first
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
version so they corrected that so it's
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
actually the right amendment is
 
01:21:47.629 --> 01:21:47.639 align:start position:0%
0180 which I think is what we voted on
 
01:21:50.669 --> 01:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
um and that so the motion was uh made
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%

then

01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
right1 uh that's 018 right1 0180 it was
 
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:34.360 align:start position:0%

that was one of the
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
1274 hang on um 1274 is not an early
 
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
bill so that can go on consent anybody

consent um all right and then lastly our
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
last uh item of business is
 
01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
um House Bill
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
1489 uh this is the bill that would deal
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
with uh town and School District ballot
 
01:25:16.719 --> 01:25:17.790 align:start position:0%
with uh town and School District ballot
recount

recount
 
01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.590 align:start position:0%
recount
appeals

01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
appeals
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
um and um at least in our caucus there
 
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
was uh some discussion of of this uh
 
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
this being an appropriate bill for
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
interim study uh and I'd like to rec uh
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
I was going to recognize representative
 
01:25:36.669 --> 01:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
gson uh but representative
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
Stapleton did we miss something or I
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
missed something uh we voted
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
on 0180 H and 0189 H but did we not have
 
01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
a vote on the
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
otpa no we did we did have was that okay
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
we did vote on that y we did on I'll
 
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
catch up no no problem no problem so um
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
in the absence of Representative gon um
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
I will move uh for interim
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
study on uh on uh House Bill
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
1489 uh and is there a second
 
01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.310 align:start position:0%
1489 uh and is there a second
representative

01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
Stapleton all right um so um if I may
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion um at least an hour
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
caucus and I'd be interested in knowing
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
what you know what the what the other
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
caucus felt about this our discussion
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
was a couple of things first that it
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
appeared that um This was
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
um this bill was was designed uh in
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
response to a particular situation and
 
01:26:46.109 --> 01:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
we I think many of us had concerns about
 
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's a a good thing to adopt
 
01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
legislation in response to just sort of
 
01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:53.119 align:start position:0%
one incident particularly where we
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a lot of
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know haven't we haven't gotten a
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
lot of input that there's been uh there
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
that this has been a continuing problem
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
I think we only had one witness who
 
01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
testified at the hearing um and the
 
01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
second thought was that maybe this is
 
01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
second thought was that maybe this is
just

01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:27:14.109 --> 01:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
something um that requires uh further
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
study if there were going to be um if we
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
were if we
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
were what this bill would do is change
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
what's known in the legal world as the
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
American Rule and the American rule
 
01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
basically is that in
 
01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
in in most areas of the
 
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
law um if you want an attorney uh you
 
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
pay your own attorney whether you win or
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
lose you pay your own attorney um we
 
01:27:42.719 --> 01:27:43.510 align:start position:0%
lose you pay your own attorney um we
have

01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
some that's that law that American rule
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
has been changed and there are a number
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
of instances in which it is allowed
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
under statute to shift the the attorney
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
um fee uh to the other side usually in
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
in favor of the the usually providing
 
01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
that the prevailing party is entitled to
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
recover their attorney's fees in civil
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
rights cases for example some consumer
 
01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
protection cases there are other areas
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
but still the rule the general rule
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
remains that um if you hire an attorney
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
you pay for the attorney whether you win
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
or lose that's the American rule this
 
01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
would propose to change that for these
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
particular types of appeals of recount
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
decisions only at the local level um and
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
so one of the thoughts that uh that
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
people had and I think it's a legitimate
 
01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.550 align:start position:0%
people had and I think it's a legitimate
one

01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
is if there was
 
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
enough trouble in this area that we
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
thought we ought to make such a
 
01:28:46.830 --> 01:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
change um first we would we ought to
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
have more evidence that it really is a
 
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
problem which we don't have and secondly
 
01:28:54.030 --> 01:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
that um maybe it would require maybe if
 
01:28:55.149 --> 01:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
we were going to make a change it
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just be limited to the local
 
01:28:58.990 --> 01:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
level but it should be you know for
 
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
recounts at the state level too you
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
would you would make that change I don't
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
know whether that's a good idea or not
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
but maybe that's something that deserves
 
01:29:10.030 --> 01:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
further study so that's why um our
 
01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%
caucus at least thought that interim
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
study made sense and I'd be interested
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
in hearing from the ranking
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
member you're not bored yet from hearing
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
from me not at all okay
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
um my personal view is that this should
 
01:29:26.199 --> 01:29:27.270 align:start position:0%
um my personal view is that this should
be

01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
itl it is not a question of recount it's
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
a question of not accepting the findings
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the recount um and it's then
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
challenging the recount which is yet
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
another step um and I think this does
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
Fall Again into the category of using
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
one particular
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
circumstance to make law that affects
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
everyone um so I I
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
would support itl and my sense is that
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
if not all almost all of my colleagues
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
agreed with that on the Democratic side
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
but I will if for any reason you think
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's more appropriate to do interim
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
study I wouldn't object to that I would
 
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
just point out to everybody that we're
 
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
early in our uh in the Committee hearing
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
process this um session and I remind you
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
that um if you vote interim study that
 
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
means you're going to have to do
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
something with the bill over the summer
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
or in the early fall at about the same
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
time that we have um primaries and
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
general elections so I would take
 
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
seriously um your commitment to put
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
invest time in this particular Bill
 
01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
understanding there might be other bills
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
that have a
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
broader impact um that will come before
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
us but if you're willing to commit to
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
the time I'm certainly not going to
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
object to
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
that wisdom of experience wisdom of
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
experience um so let me ask uh just uh
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
for a show of hands May mainly from my
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
caucus I guess uh does uh what
 
01:31:39.149 --> 01:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh says has said uh
 
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
change your mind if it does you may
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
raise your hand and I will be the first
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
to do that her message
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
carries so I'm going to withdraw my
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
motion and recognize representative
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
so I drew the Short Straw
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
again um uh Mr chair with respect to the
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
genuine concern of the Prime sponsor of
 
01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
this bill nonetheless I would um move um
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
itl second by representative Wallace um
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
there any further
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill all right uh
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would ask the clerk to
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
call the role
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%

01:33:22.159 --> 01:33:23.149 align:start position:0%
um and I will write the report
thank

01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
um all right um so
 
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
um that's that kind of concludes our
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
business except for one thing I I would
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
like to um I'd like to talk just for a
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
moment about um schedu I I've now
 
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
scheduled out all of the hearings that
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
are of the bills that are before our
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
committee and I think it takes us up to
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
February 21st first
 
01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
um and I had some discussion with a
 
01:33:58.990 --> 01:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
ranking member about um scheduling
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
executive sessions I know that there was
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
some sentiment and you may be right that
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
um I scheduled this one a little too
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
early so I um I going forward I think it
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
probably makes sense to have at least a
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
full week uh between the time we hear
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
Bill actually more more maybe would end
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
up being a week and a half if we have
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
our our our hearings on Wednesdays uh
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
before we have executive sessions um but
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
um representative uh Smith has suggested
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the way to proceed is not
 
01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
to schedule any executive sessions until
 
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
after February
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
21st or maybe make the first one as you
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
know the February 21st we don't have a
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
full day that's the last day of our
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
hearings we don't have a full day um so
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
we could schedule some executive
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
sessions then um I'm
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
just I'm a little bit worried about
 
01:34:59.550 --> 01:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
doing that just because I'm uh I as I
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
said the speaker is really on a rooll to
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
get to have us get bills to him as
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible I don't I don't
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
think I think we've done a pretty good
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
job on in that regard but um what I
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
might do I guess I would say is this I
 
01:35:18.669 --> 01:35:18.679 align:start position:0%
might schedule one executive session
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
between now and February 21st um and
 
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.510 align:start position:0%
between now and February 21st um and
then

01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
schedule another executive session for
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
that day and and maybe and and perhaps
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
later um so that every everyone will
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
have enough time um there'll be no sort
 
01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
of time pressure uh on on uh bills um
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
and what I would say is in terms of
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
dates in terms of days it probably will
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
end up having to be on a Monday with the
 
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
because we're going to be having
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
sessions every Thursday and that's the
 
01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
only um other day right now that the
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
room that this room is available so
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
would probably end up having to be on
 
01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
Monday on a Monday um with the one
 
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
caveat that state and federal has the
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
has this room on Fridays and they as I
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
understand it have a relatively uh small
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
number of bills before them so if they
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
finish up their hearings pretty quickly
 
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
and and a Friday is available I might
 
01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
schedule the uh the hearing the
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
executive session on Friday
 
01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
chair um this is something where I have
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of pride in the Judiciary
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
Committee because typically the
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee agrees more often
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
than it disagrees so my only suggestion
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
is that whenever possible and we have a
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
full committee maybe we hear a bill one
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
week and the next week after public
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
hearings if we have a consensus or what
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
appears to be a consensus we exec right
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
after a public hearing just to take care
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
of some of the ones where we have have
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
consensus on sure no I'm I I think that
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
makes sense and I'm obviously under the
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
rule it would require my agreement and
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
the with the ranking member but if we
 
01:37:02.189 --> 01:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
have that I fine on that representative
 
01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair in order to exec a
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
bill um after a public hearing it has to
 
01:37:16.109 --> 01:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
be with our agreement that day it can't
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
be another day the rule says it has to
 
01:37:23.310 --> 01:37:23.320 align:start position:0%
be that day so while I appreciate
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's suggestion I
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't think we could do it the next day
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
unless we had in fact put it on the
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
calendar that's number one number two I
 
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
I greatly admire your commitment to the
 
01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.550 align:start position:0%
I greatly admire your commitment to the
speaker

01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation I too share his belief
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to pile all the bills
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
so that we're here at the end but we are
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
way ahead of what other committees have
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
done we have the bills we worked on last
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
week uh with such pleasure um and we
 
01:38:09.510 --> 01:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
have the bills that we worked on
 
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
today um those are all now going to be
 
01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
out there other committees are also
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
beginning to do what they should
 
01:38:21.550 --> 01:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
do I would suggest that the in
 
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
convenience we cause at least some of
 
01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.310 align:start position:0%
convenience we cause at least some of
our

01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
members who are juggling a lot of other
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities by meeting on a day
 
01:38:34.109 --> 01:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
other than Wednesday except in an
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
emergency really isn't
 
01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
Justified we have a relatively short
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
calendar if I remember correctly on the
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
21st which means that we can add to that
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
day in the afternoon exing on certain
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
bills that we will have heard a few
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
weeks earlier so that gets a few more
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
out there and then when we come back
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
after the break all relaxed and happy we
 
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
can immediately begin um the first week
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
in March to um exec and we can get
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
through spent a whole day exing and we
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
can do that
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
without forcing people who are otherwise
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
working or or meeting um family
 
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
obligations uh
 
01:39:36.669 --> 01:39:36.679 align:start position:0%
to upset their schedule so I would
 
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
really hope that except in an emergency
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
you would let us stick to Wednesdays
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
unless there's just no
 
01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
alternative yes representative K would
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
it be possible say were hearing bills on
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday of one week the following
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
Wednesday to
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
notice some of the bills to put at the
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
end of the hearings that way we could
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
have a week to think about them but then
 
01:40:06.109 --> 01:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
they'd still be on a Wednesday because
 
01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:08.679 align:start position:0%
my only thought is that when we pile all
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
of them at the end it can get hard to
 
01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
remember all of the testimony from all I
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
think we have
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
30 two more bills left or something yeah
 
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's quite it is quite
 
01:40:25.229 --> 01:40:25.239 align:start position:0%
um yes of course I just the days that I
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
I don't have it in front of me but the
 
01:40:30.669 --> 01:40:30.679 align:start position:0%
what I have seen of what the chair has
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
done is except for the
 
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
21st he has filled the days with
 
01:40:41.709 --> 01:40:41.719 align:start position:0%
hearings and um with the last one
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
frequently being something like at 3:30
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
um we'd have to then move some some of
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
those and I think all of us would prefer
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
to have well I don't know but I mean I
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
think it makes more sense to uh to make
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
sure we go through the bill so that we
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
have enough time if we need work
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
sessions or subcommittees to do it but
 
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
we have um we have a lot of time and we
 
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
are we I think we' more than fulfilled
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
Our obligation I'd also like to point
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
out something that representative
 
01:41:21.390 --> 01:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
Alexander said that
 
01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
relevant uh particularly relevant as all
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
of his comments are and that is that
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
because we are so frequently in
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
agreement we have so many bills that
 
01:41:33.149 --> 01:41:33.159 align:start position:0%
we're putting on
 
01:41:36.669 --> 01:41:36.679 align:start position:0%
consent that means that the speaker does
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
not have to be concerned about the
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
time that is going to be added to the
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
calendars by bills coming from the
 
01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee so I I really I mean
 
01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm I'm going to agree with
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
whatever you do Mr chairman but um I I
 
01:41:59.229 --> 01:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
know that um a number of
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
my of of the Democrats and it's probably
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
so for the Republicans to actually work
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
for a living and um I know that's an
 
01:42:11.550 --> 01:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
oldfashioned concept but it's one that I
 
01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:13.719 align:start position:0%
respect I mean i' want if somebody would
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
hire me I'd be glad to work for a living
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
but nobody seems to want to hire me and
 
01:42:21.629 --> 01:42:21.639 align:start position:0%
so it's just it's a hard it's hard for
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
people to add another day and and I
 
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
guess my point is we don't have to and
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
can still fulfill our obligations I
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't know perhaps representative
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
Wallace has a different take on that
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the leading um I'm just
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
sure we did uh historically in the
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee a our say a
 
01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
little bit busier committee we would
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
notice that we would have public
 
01:42:46.189 --> 01:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
hearings when time permit so if we do
 
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
have you mean session 15 minutes we
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
finish up a bill we could take a
 
01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
an uncon an uncontested Bill take that
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
up exec and we could do that throughout
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
the day as well right that's that's we
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
get some options I think we'll probably
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
work it out so you know as I look at
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
this I I see let me suggest this um as I
 
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
looked at the schedule on the uh it's
 
01:43:11.589 --> 01:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
not on the
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
14th we have our last hearing schedule
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
for 1145 as opposed to uh there's none
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
at 2:30 or 3:15 so we would have some
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
time that afternoon noon and then as the
 
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
as representative Smith pointed out on
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
the 21st which is our last day of
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
hearings we we only have hearings
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
scheduled for the morning so maybe
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
between that's good between doing an
 
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
executive session on some bills on the
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
14th more on the
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
21st and then also
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
um representative Smith and I can be can
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
be sort of mindful of when we have bills
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
coming up including even this Wednesday
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
if we have bills coming up that it looks
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
like you know we've we it appears from
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
the hearing that we are all kind of in
 
01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
agreement uh we may be able to EXA those
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
right away at the end of the day so
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
maybe by doing all of those things um we
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
can stick to Wednesdays and I will uh
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a reasonable way to go
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to do that
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for just like make let me
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
take um have a comment I want to just
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank um was say I say Mar
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh um representative Smith for making
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
the comment yes um we do some of us do
 
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
work a lot of um hours and stuff and
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
still um come here to try to make a
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
difference and so I just want to say it
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
would be very appreciative if we could
 
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
stay on Wednesdays that would be great
 
01:44:45.149 --> 01:44:45.159 align:start position:0%
and um I agree too if whatever is going
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
to be the easiest for us to go for is uh
 
01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
the best thing so thank you
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
great all right um so uh that's at least
 
01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
you know tentatively that's that will be
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
my plan to have an exec session on the
 
01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon on the 14th another one
 
01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
on the 21st and then uh and hopefully
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
try to get to exec some of the bills
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to be hearing over between
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
now and then at the end of the day if if
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith and I are in
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
agreement and it appears that we have uh
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
consensus um the only thing left I have
 
01:45:21.589 --> 01:45:21.599 align:start position:0%

01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
