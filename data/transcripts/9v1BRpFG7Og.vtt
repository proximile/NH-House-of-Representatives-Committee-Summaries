bail reform and bail bills and I believe
 
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.560 align:start position:0%

today from the counties and I would
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
invite what we get for a
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
please

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
morning everybody superintendent Henry
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
from Rockham County Jail how are you
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:23.959 align:start position:0%
good by all means the floor is yours
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah sure I didn't know if you had
 
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
questions of me that's what I'm here for
 
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
of well I we had assumed that you might
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
want to tell us a little bit about um
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
how Bale interacts with your agency what
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
um what happens what you do what you see
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
happening now sure um so bail in general
 
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.110 align:start position:0%
happening now sure um so bail in general
it's

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
uh traditionally again this is I've been
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
around for almost 20 years uh over 20
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
years somebody gets picked up for a
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
crime and then they can either get bail
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner at a PD or even at the jail
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh for us the way it works it is
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner comes out meets meets
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
with the uh individual and from there
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
they decide what bail it might be um do
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
the paperwork uh collect money all those
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
type of things from the individual and
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
then from there if they're being
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
released we release them could be PR
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
bail it could be cash bail if they have
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
cash show up or if not it's prevented
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
detention then they stay with
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
us I know you guys were look a couple
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
things uh magistrates at one time um but
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're still that's
 
00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
still something out there which is great
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
because we have a lot more to talk about
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh I know you're looking at 13 um crimes
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
that would be automatically would have
 
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
to stay that wouldn't be that wouldn't
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
really affect the jails because we have
 
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
people stay anyways um so we're we're
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
kind of used to
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
that biggest thing for us is we lack of
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners that is the the huge
 
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
problem and I've seen that again over 20
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
plus years I worked with bail
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and part of it is is
 
00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
them not getting paid be honest with you
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
I work at bail Commissioners there was
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
,500 to $2,000 that they were not
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for and they tried way back
 
00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:08.919 align:start position:0%
when to get the courts to help them out
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
and they said no so you had a lot of
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
people leave because of that even though
 
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a small fee but we're waking
 
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
these people up in the middle of the
 
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
night to come on out over and over again
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
and to do it for free was always very
 
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
frustrating for them so a way for them
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
to actually obtain their fees I think
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
we'd actually get more bail
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
Commissioners which is helpful because
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
then people can if they don't belong
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
inside the jail or uh again bail is just
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're showing up a court
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
so if they have that opportunity then
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
they should have that opportunity and
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
not have to put on a police officer make
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
a decision of hand summons or sometimes
 
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
the PDS will have to go no bail and do
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
it themselves and that means they have
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
to show up at court and justify that um
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
because we because we can't find a bail
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner and that is prevalent in a
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
lot of places a lack of bail
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so so there's that um um
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
anything else you guys had was there
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
other questions on that sure um if you
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
could speak to what what um what do you
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
have in in your facility to deal with
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
people that um either are suffering from
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
substance abuse when they arrive or from
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
mental health problems sure so which is
 
00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
we'll say 99% of people coming in either
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
on on something are they cooccurring so
 
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
we have a lot so for dealing with those
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
individuals um again that's is always
 
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
tough why even doing the booking
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
procedure or sometimes even bail
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner because they're not in the
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
right State of Mind is also difficult
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
where we sometimes not able to do a bail
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner first and once they either
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
come down from their their drugs or
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
alcohol they get still have another
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do bail when they're able
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
to be coherent for like us for
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County we do have 24hour
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
medical care um some places do not
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Care is not 24 hours a day
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
but what every place does have is a
 
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
screening tool we use for um uh for
 
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
health purposes you know how the
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
whatever's going on that they need for
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
medications those kinds of things and a
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
mental health evaluation and that's 247
 
00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
we always everybody gets screened in if
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
again I will also preface if we're able
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
to there are individuals we're not able
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
to work with them yet that we have to
 
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
put it aside and wait until they can
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
calm down and keep coming back to them
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
to see where they're at but once they're
 
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
booked in we use those tools
 
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh the health evaluation tools will go
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
to medical and then if it's 24 hours a
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
day seven days a week my medical will
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
come down afterwards and actually do a
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
full screening if medical is at another
 
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
place only during the day or first and
 
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
second shift they'll come down and do
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
that screening in the morning if it's
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
mental health evaluation like we do the
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
sheets what it does it adds up to a
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
certain amount of points those kinds of
 
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
things and it gets flagged in the mental
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
health department and again if they're
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
still there the next day they also will
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
be seen by mental health to evaluate
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
them and that can rise to a whole other
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
level of different things just because
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
somebody's like say a protective custody
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
or even PR
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
bail it could rise to a level where
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing an IA process and to get
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
them help and that could stall process
 
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:13.990 align:start position:0%
them help and that could stall process
from

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
leaving um for just so you know personal
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
recogniz and bail if they do not have a
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
ride in the middle of the night none of
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
us release them of which technically
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
speaking they're free individuals but
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
but back in the day there was an
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
individual released from a jail under
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
under that went out in the middle of the
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
road sat down and was hit by a vehicle
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
because they wanted to commit suicide so
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
we no longer do that to help these
 
00:20:42.669 --> 00:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
individuals out which is pushing our
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
what we're doing but again I'd rather go
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
to court on safety all of us the
 
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
superintend rather go to court on safety
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
for for an individual rather than having
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
them go get injured so if I could just
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
on that so you're talking strictly about
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
people that have been screened to have
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
mental health problems us a person who's
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
fine in released on PR if they have a
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
ride or not they're free to walk off or
 
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
if they have a ride not not in the dark
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
we won't let them walk off just in the
 
00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:09.559 align:start position:0%
dark on the r without a ride because I
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
know where you're located yeah we all
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
are highway right there yeah kaas County
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
Mill nowhere so yeah if they don't have
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
a ride whether they're they're mentally
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
ill or not we won't because of it's it's
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
just too dangerous for them and for us
 
00:21:25.149 --> 00:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
and again I'd rather be you know Tried
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
by you know Tried by you know a jury
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
rather than Carri somebody so we all
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
have taken that stance many years many
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
years to do that that's only at night
 
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
time and the daytime daytime they they
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
can depending which jail you're at my
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
jail doesn't allow people to just walk I
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
actually pay for taxi voucher
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
rides I'll you know a lot of money but
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
so um along the same questioning with
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
the mental health um say for example you
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
get someone that comes in who may be
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
schizophrenic and they're off their meds
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
which is why they're
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
there they
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
are they seen that night or or is it the
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
next day by mental health and and if so
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
when how do you know what meds are on do
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
you have access to the to the um to the
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
prescribe to the prescriptions they have
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
based on the electronic system or how do
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
you how do you figure that out you got a
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
couple things one if they come with any
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
medication that um is bagged and then
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
we'll go to Medical uh because they'll
 
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
have to go back and confirm the
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
medications their doctors all those
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of things uh mental health usually
 
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
is only in during a day and not
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
everybody has seven days a week so um or
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
like I do um so if somebody was a higher
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
level really need things there are
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
places to call in to evaluate that kind
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
of person especially if they're
 
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
experiencing a severe crisis um once
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
medical or mental health comes down
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
again depending on what you have um some
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
can wait because it's just they're okay
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
they're safe but if they're in crisis
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
they'll get somebody then they try to
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
work with that individual to find out
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
what information they can if that
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
individual is willing to sign a waiver
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
usually what they do so that way they
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
can call their doctors the pharmacy all
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
those kind of things they will backtrack
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
and find all their medications that
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
they're on to get them what they need if
 
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
they can't what we a lot of times will
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
do is do you have a relative we can get
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
holde they had you know sign off on the
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
that allow us to we'll get hold of a
 
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
relative those kinds of things they do
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
medical does everything they can to try
 
00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:24.909 align:start position:0%
medical does everything they can to try
to

00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
find what their history is and what
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
proper medication they can Beyond so
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
that transfers from basically the
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
corrections end to the the medical end
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
we let them do that and they do a good
 
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
job across the board I will say that
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
I've been I've worked from marrt County
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
I was superintendent of Carol County
 
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
with second smallest in the state to
 
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
Rocky ham County second biggest in the
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
state so I can tell you I have firsthand
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
experience with how that works and
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's pretty consistent all across the
 
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.230 align:start position:0%
that's pretty consistent all across the
board

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
okay and substance abuse um do you have
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh any kind of program to bring people
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
down who are going into a draws like the
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
Box Zone or things of that nature so
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
couple things the boxone stuff that we
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
what that would be more of we'd find out
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
if they're actually on it then you have
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
to go back the doctors make sure they're
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
really on it and all those kinds of
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
things and then they may maintain on
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
somebody who's just in protective
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
custody or even PR bail for over the
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
night are probably not going to get that
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
because we can't even show that they're
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
actually on it you can't give just give
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
it to somebody because they say it but
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
if they are um the the RSA 30b is pretty
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
clear um you know we we'd continue with
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
their medication
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
screen them for the medication those
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of things they would be continuing
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
on we all have some sort of tapers um if
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
they're going through some bad R drawal
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawals so your Medicals departments
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
um all have protocols we give
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
medications um you have anything from
 
00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:46.039 align:start position:0%
not just medications but also like they
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
Gatorade everything else and we've come
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
a long way I mean over the years uh
 
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't medications we withdraw we just
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
try to make you as comfortable as
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
possible a lot of things have changed
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
over the years none of us want to deal
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
with a person who's in um being very
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
very sick and then which makes them very
 
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
angry and then makes them hard to deal
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
with and that's not what we want to do
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
we want to try make them comfortable as
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
possible to get them through because
 
00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:11.799 align:start position:0%
it's not again our goal is Corrections
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
our goal is not punishment punishment is
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
the court you go to jail our job is to
 
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're going back to your
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
family or moving on to another facility
 
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
or whatever you're going to do so
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of protocols and I can
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
tell you in New Hampshire five are the
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
10 counties I'll have Prime care which
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
is a medical company
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
and they're NCCC certified which is the
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
gold standard of um so they actually
 
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
have an independent company come look at
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
them make sure they're doing the right
 
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.149 align:start position:0%
them make sure they're doing the right
things

00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
and they have wonderful policies and
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
protocols we have things called levels
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
which if you come in and you are with a
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
certain charge or crime or behavior you
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
maybe put on
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
a uh a one-on-one watch which means I
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
have to have an officer right there
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
could be level one watch which is every
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
15 minutes could be level two could be
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
level three so we have levels for those
 
00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:03.799 align:start position:0%
that have mental health issues uh for us
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
and this what comes
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
into daily rate which is some of the
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
things that always get asked for there's
 
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
no way to calculate daily rate used to
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
be ADP versus your
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
budget now and I spoken to National
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
insute Corrections American jail
 
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
Association to try to figure out how to
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
calculate what it costs I can't if an
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
individual comes in tonight who needs
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
medical care
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
and one ambulance ride for me is
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
$1,700 so that person just cost me
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
$1,700 right right there if a person
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
comes in and that we now need a
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
one-on-one C person with them if you did
 
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
oneon-one 24 hours a day seven days a
 
00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
week say they stayed that's 21 spots of
 
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
overtime for that individual plus their
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
Medical Care Plus their mental health
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
care and all those kinds of things so it
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's very hard to say what an
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
average cost is going to be are you able
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
to build Medicaid for uh any of those
 
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
things like the ambulance ride Services
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
if they happen to have it when they come
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
in which some do some don't uh if they
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
have private insurance we try to go
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
after it but most these people do not
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
have anything so no um you that is also
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
shut off 30 days after you're in anyway
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
so no um we I shouldn't say shut off
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
it's paused it's paused and then it's
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
able to turn back on 30 days before they
 
00:27:21.149 --> 00:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
go so that whole time frame between we
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
pay for all of it and we usually pay for
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
the a rides now we only pay what I think
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's 1225 of the Medicaid rate
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
for hospitals and that kind of stuff if
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
an individual is actually admitted to
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
the hospital um we can go back and try
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
to get that reimbursed
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
admitted and that's where you start
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
splitting hairs with the hospitals they
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
can do an observation period if they do
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
observation we pay that we pay that bill
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
so sometimes we're in Conflict like you
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
admitting them or not because we need to
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
figure this out because I can get money
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
back and um so yeah we eat a lot of that
 
00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
cost I mean it's very expensive
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
including medications I mean I had an
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
individual who uh his medication was
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
going to cost me a million dollars at
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
Carol County had to have it um thank God
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
another company came out of the woodwork
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
after I spent $200,000 in small little
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
Carol County which is way more than I
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
had in the budget uh to take that over
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
so costs are very tough to determine if
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
somebody has to stay on a EPC um and
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
continue with that that is very very
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
expensive it doesn't happen a lot in the
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
county happens a lot in the state um but
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
so kind of like um a school board almost
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's hard to predict but you don't know
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
if you have a special ed student come in
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
and can blow your budget right out of
 
00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:36.519 align:start position:0%
the water I used to call him a sag
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
special a guess um on my budgets yeah
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
and that's basically what it is you can
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
take a pattern of what you had in the
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
past year you know couple years that
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
sounds pretty good it may build a little
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
bit in but one person can come in and
 
00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:52.519 align:start position:0%
you know open heart surgery uh something
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
else that happened you just don't know
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
the overdoses that we have are in
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have gone through the roof we
 
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
use Narcan on a regular basis and you
 
00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
take somebody as Narcan goes out an
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
ambulance needs more Narcan or Narcan
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
drip um and they need higher level of
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
care that's often we're sending people
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
to the hospital on a regular basis you
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
know yesterday was two people to the
 
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
hospital the people that we see are very
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
acute the acuy of mental health and just
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
um health issues has exploded um since
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
the about the middle of Co on and has
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
not stopped so that's has increased
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
across the board for all of us is there
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
any mechanism for you to get additional
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
funding from the state or from the
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
federal government to help offset some
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
of these costs that you're aware
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
of no I mean so not really I mean the
 
00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:41.789 align:start position:0%
of no I mean so not really I mean the
opiate

00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
opiate
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
abatement um trust which I do sit on um
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
Sometimes some grants come out for there
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
we just did a round of reimbursement for
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
Medicaid assisted treatment back for two
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
years so some of us got some of that are
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
getting well once it makes through Gene
 
00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
C we're make getting back some of that
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
cost but moving forward no there there
 
00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
really isn't a
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism what about um
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
services from outside do do you have any
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
type of arrangement where um people that
 
00:30:13.149 --> 00:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
come in there that may not have Medicaid
 
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:15.519 align:start position:0%
or something or or anything Social
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
Security any of that where services are
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to come in and help these people
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
or or talk with them or yeah so we have
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of report a lot of the communities
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
we also have we'll have the rapid
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
response team come in and work with
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
individuals if we need to have them put
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
into an
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation um most jails I think almost
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
all we have case managers will work with
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
these individuals um to get their
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
licenses uh try to get them set up with
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
their first doctor's appointment again a
 
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
protective custody inmate or just a PR
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
inmate is probably not going to get
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
these things we'll they're we'll give a
 
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
you know if we can give a pamphlet hey
 
00:30:49.149 --> 00:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
you want a contact they're just not
 
00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
there long enough for us to to Really to
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
do much besides care from why they're
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
there if they're there for any length of
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
time then we're able to try to give them
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
the first doctor's appointment try to
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
get them uh through their social
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
security anything they need that we can
 
00:31:02.909 --> 00:31:02.919 align:start position:0%
our case managers will try to work with
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
them to get them hooked up as fast as
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
possible including housing we'll look
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
for housing form those kinds of things
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
it just depends if we have if they're
 
00:31:11.629 --> 00:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
there for enough with us for but we
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
inside have a lot of that and a lot of
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
connections in the
 
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519 align:start position:0%
community to the best of your knowledge
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
what is that like across all the
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
counties is it very inconsistent is it
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say it's very inconsistent
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
I mean you you go to the the northern
 
00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
part of State there's the services
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
probably not there as robust as they are
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
down the state um I know like my friends
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
sub there he has made connections in the
 
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
community and and does what he can but
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
again it really just depends on what you
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
have in your community those kinds of
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
things so it's it's all over I would say
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
it's all over the map um do you work at
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
all with any pre-trial Services um in
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
other words a handoff to people who are
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
out on getting out on bail so Rockingham
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
County is a little different yeah we
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
have our own pre-trial service program
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
the the jail we pay for the program
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
itself oh okay um so we have a pre-child
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
program we also have adult diversion
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
program can you explain those to us
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
adult diversion that's done the court
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
recommend adult diversion we have one
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
lady that works with them they'll come
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
in they do check-ins and she has some do
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
some programs those kinds of things we
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
actually never really see them the
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
pre-trial program again it's
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations by the court for
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
somebody to be on pre-trial release
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
which would mean we would monitor them
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
and and and they would have to come in
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
do be tested on your analysis testing
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
see where they're at and all those kinds
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
of things now do you do electronic
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
monitoring yeah it's all they' all be on
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring through
 
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
that different between us in other
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
places um because the jail owns it the
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
liability is on the jail and where my
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
people and me person are not indemnified
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
the counties that own the court owns it
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
are indemnified so like we get pushed
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
back from the some of the judges for
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
rocking in particular who are used to
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
some other Cy saying well why aren't you
 
00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
putting large amount of people out
 
00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
which if you look at some of these other
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
counties they don't even know where half
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
the people are it's NE here or there I'm
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
like because we own them we it's my
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
liability not the courts uh so we put
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
out the proper people if you have some
 
00:33:12.029 --> 00:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
crimes that are not appropriate we don't
 
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
put them out there's also other criteria
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
you need to have housing and this and
 
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
that so it's it's a a bunch of stuff to
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
go through and that's normal of all the
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
programs but Rockham County in
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
particular we just they're ones we won't
 
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
put out that the court if they wanted to
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
take that if they took over our program
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
they could put more people out because
 
00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
then they're they' be indemnified from
 
00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
all those lawsuits when someone goes on
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
and does something heinous um well
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
explain that to me I'm a little confused
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
so if if the court says you are assigned
 
00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:39.190 align:start position:0%
so if if the court says you are assigned
to

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
pre-trial the state court assigns it to
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
the county pre-trial the county pays for
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
it and the County's responsible for the
 
00:33:50.909 --> 00:33:50.919 align:start position:0%
person and the county decides whether
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
they not they get out we decide because
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
we own the program decide if they get on
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
it's a recommendation from the court
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay um do they cannot make a the court
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
cannot make the jail pretty much do
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
right doesn't set bail it leaves it up
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
to you to decide whether they should be
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
out on pre-trial they'll make
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
recommendations that should be on
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
pre-trial release and then we will
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
determine under our program our criteria
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
if they belong out if the pre- child
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
program is owned by the court then
 
00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:16.599 align:start position:0%
usually those people will just follow
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
what the judge's order says and here you
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
go the judges determined that but
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
because we own it we pay for it and it's
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
a high liability for us and the the
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
county taxpayer dollars they come back
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
and sue me and everything else we're
 
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
going to own that uh liability that's
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
why if it's goes to the back to the
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
courts they own that liability if
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
somebody goes out that's the way ours
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
Works we're a little different I think
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
we're the only one that actually pay for
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
it and some counties do not have a
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
pre-child program uh I know you guys
 
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
talking about next week but I'll just
 
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
throw this out one reasons why a lot of
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
counties and don't want pre-trial
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
program or don't have it there is no
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
tooth in a pre-trial
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
program I can't bring anybody back if
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
somebody violates in a pre-trial program
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
uh and should be back in the jail and to
 
00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
do something severe I actually can't
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
bring them back unless they make if it's
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
a crime and I can call police officer
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
and great but if they're high doing all
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff they shouldn't be doing
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have the authority to bring
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
them back you have to write a letter to
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
the court the court can make termination
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
to bring them back work they're on
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
probation probation can say you've
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
messed up you're going back to jail and
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
it could be for a short duration of time
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
which they do couple days of reassess
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
find what's going on the county program
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
we can't do
 
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
that uh so something looked down along
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
the road putting some language in there
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
saying that the counties they had a
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
pre-trial program they could bring them
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
back we could manage and handle people
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
better than trying to wait for the court
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
we could bring them back then work with
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
the court those kinds of things so
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's it's a it's a makes it difficult
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
on that kind of program when you don't
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
have really control but yet you're
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to oversee them and make sure
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
they're not doing well it seems kind of
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
pointless if you put somebody on a on an
 
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
ankle monitor and say you can't go here
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
and here between these hours and they do
 
00:35:52.599 --> 00:35:53.870 align:start position:0%
and here between these hours and they do
it

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
anyway what do you do like
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
to the court and there yes which is very
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
frustrating yeah it's very I me it's
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
frustrating because you know you could
 
00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
have a victim out there and they're not
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
in the zone they're not supposed to be
 
00:36:08.829 --> 00:36:08.839 align:start position:0%
there now you can maybe it's our Zone
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
inclusive Zone supposed to be there or
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
it could be the court ordered 100 feet
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
you can let a PD know maybe they went
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
there maybe they'll go pick him up but
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
probably not that we have to send it to
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
court and let them violate and those
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of things but normally if it's
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
like a probation officer they just go
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
back and pick them up obviously you're
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
not doing what you're supposed to be
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
doing we need to reassess and figure out
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
what's going on and do you Lea with
 
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
parole as well we do we work with them
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
too um but again they have their own
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
pretty much their own program right um
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
but if they violate someone they bring
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
them and they drop them off and yeah
 
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
they can do a two things with them they
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
can violate them um well the viol and
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
bring them back and the way it works is
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
if they get a new charge they stay with
 
00:36:46.309 --> 00:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
us while they go through a new charge
 
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
before they actually violate them which
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
that was a change
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
from probably eight maybe more nine
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
years ago got time flies where it used
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
to be if they were picked up on a
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
violation they go right to the state
 
00:36:59.470 --> 00:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
prison but then there was some nice
 
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
downshifting where they would pick them
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
up on new charge put them to the County
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
facility where we get to hold them and
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
pay for them and then once they with a
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
new charge then then they get violated
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
and go to state prison so they can pick
 
00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
it up it was some downshifting someone's
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
on state parole they commit a crime on
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
state parole state parole officer gives
 
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
them to the county you hold them until
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
they get found guilty or not guilty and
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
then based on that decision they violate
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
them then they go back to the state y it
 
00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
used to be reversed years ago it was a
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
it was a downshift and there was
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
testimony at that time too that was
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
going to be a downshift to us to the
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
count I generally I generally push back
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
on the downshift concept but that that's
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
that's actually a real example yeah I
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
remember okay and I I'll speak for
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
rocking can of myself uh truthfully if I
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
had my way I would take two years you
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
know don't don't take us all
 
00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:56.839 align:start position:0%
superintendant I I would take two figure
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
sentences and have our own probation
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
where most of us have gone to a 90-day
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
in-house treatment program um with step
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
downs and all kinds of stuff and if you
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
look at the research one year of after
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
care where you can actually have our
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
case managers follow in the community
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
make sure go to doctor's appointments
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
everything else um there's High success
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
those programs uh Sullivan County does a
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
great job they were they partner with
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
probation and the courts were all on
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
board to do it down there they get two
 
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
years probation first year they do the
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
program and then then step down if they
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
do well they cut down the they cut off
 
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.190 align:start position:0%
do well they cut down the they cut off
the

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
probation uh if counties had that then
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
we would have more control over those
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
two years which are shorter sentences on
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of different things and they're
 
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
not usually the higher violent crimes or
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
anything like that you'd actually have
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
more leverage to work with these
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
individuals because the more they're
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
longer they're clean the longer that
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
they're in the programs those kinds of
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
things the less likelihood that they're
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
going to reoffend and that does not mean
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
be inside the jail for two years that
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
means get them to go through the program
 
00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:53.079 align:start position:0%
step down to work release step down to
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
home confinement but still having the
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
ability to be working with them if they
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
met and if they make a mistake um could
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
still stay out there or doesn't need
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
pulled back pulled back and go okay you
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
need come back in we need to restart
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
with some programs we need to start
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
looking this again we know that people
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
are going to fall off the wagon and but
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
how bad and what have they done and what
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
can we work them with that's just my Pie
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
in the Sky that's me definitely good
 
00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:17.390 align:start position:0%
in the Sky that's me definitely good
input

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
input
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
um back to the to the strictly the bail
 
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.910 align:start position:0%
um back to the to the strictly the bail
issue

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
about do you have any idea first well
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
let's go back to your pre-trial what
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
does it cost that program to the county
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
pre-trial program yeah I look I mean I
 
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
have to look at my budget uh well we
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
have two dedicated full-time officers to
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
that pre- for us for the pre-trial
 
00:39:40.599 --> 00:39:43.109 align:start position:0%
that pre- for us for the pre-trial
program

00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
um beyond the electronic monitoring uh
 
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
most of bracelets we end up paying for
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
because it's it's cost effective
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
so two salaries plus the bracelets is
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
basically what's costing us and we have
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
end space so I'd have to look at the
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
budget exactly what it is but I could
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
get you that yeah if you wouldn't mind
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
the the bracelet I'm particularly
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
interested in I feel like that could be
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
better utilized across the state and let
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
more people remain out and continue
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
working if they were able to be
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
monitored can you give me an idea on the
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
cost and the scope of that program so we
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
monitor through the pre-trial program we
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
actually do monitor them so bracelets
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
cost anywhere from depending on what
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
they are could be up $10 a day for for
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
the bracelet and there's a couple
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
different ways I mean if the count
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to to pay for they could or the
 
00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
individual a lot of times if they're
 
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
working it's charged to the individual
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
because they still get the opportunity
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
to be out in the community right
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
monitoring it just depends like we have
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
a preow program so my people do monitor
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh so the company doesn't monitor notif
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
no not the company doesn't monitor we we
 
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
monitor because we're the ones that have
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
to go tell the courts and everything
 
00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
else and we're ones watching the
 
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
computer everything not everybody has a
 
00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
program like that uh smaller facilities
 
00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
will be tough because you don't have a
 
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
Manpower maybe to if you put a bunch of
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
people out somebody has to be either on
 
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
their phone tracking them and the
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
computer's tracking them and figuring
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
out where they are setting up those
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
zones bringing them in to tell them
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
where they can and can't go you bring
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
them in uh so often especially if
 
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
they're some sort of drug offense who do
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
your analysis test to make sure they're
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
not using new substances so there's
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
there's there's Manpower in this but
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
again I too believe that better off in
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
the community and doing some of these
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
things working with them and the jails
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
have a good opportunity I think to do it
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
because we're open 247 you can work with
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
an individual who may have a day job
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
and can't be pulled out to go get do
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
your analysis some other things so they
 
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
may be able to come in the in the
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
evening and vice versa um where some
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
other places you know 9 to5 we're done
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
so we're able to work with I feel able
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
to work with some others just because we
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
can make things work for them but in all
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
the jails across the state are open 24
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
hours a day yes we we canot
 
00:41:46.359 --> 00:41:48.230 align:start position:0%
hours a day yes we we canot
close

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
close
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of whether or not the
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
company that you deal with also offers
 
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
Services where they do the
 
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
monitoring um no I don't know companies
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
that offer the monitor I know in
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts their parole has a system
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
where I believe it's a third party that
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
monitors and notifies the parole
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
officers okay your parole is here or
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
there they didn't check you know they
 
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
might with something something explored
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's probably at a substantial cost I'm
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
sure anything can be done in money yeah
 
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you anyone uh on the
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler thank you Mr
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
chairman speaking of anything can be
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
done with money um
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
if there was the money to invest in the
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
community as well in terms of Mental
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
Health Services or uh other Community
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
Based Services that might be able to
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
catch those people with that issue
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
before they get to jail do you think
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
that that would help with the people who
 
00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:47.079 align:start position:0%
are admitted to the prison and the
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
amount of people you're seeing with
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issues yeah absolutely
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh brick and mortar and you'll hear it
 
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
over and over again from all of us and
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
everybody else the state just LAX brick
 
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
and mortar for not just twofold here
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
getting out someplace to go so they can
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
get stable and move on we don't want put
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
them back in the same place they were
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
because they're just going to come back
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
two if there were places like
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts have where you can go and
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
show up because you're going in a mental
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
health crisis or other things or police
 
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
can bring you there where Specialists
 
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
are there for Mental Health crisis and
 
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with them uh would stop them
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
from coming inside the jail when they
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
come into jail I can't use four por
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
restraints we cannot forcibly medicate
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
anybody so you're dealing with a a
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
system is designed for for criminals
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
okay so and yes we do a lot of training
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
and mental health we try to treat them
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
kick gloves but there're just things we
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
can't do that other places can which are
 
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.549 align:start position:0%
can't do that other places can which are
more

00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate it's there's a bunch of
 
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
other bills I've testify against so
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
seems to be more and more pushing out to
 
00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:46.359 align:start position:0%
the jails and and away from other places
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
that actually specialize in this stuff
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
now don't wrong jails have we have put a
 
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
lot of money into specializing these
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of things but I but I'm not a
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
hospital we're not not a hospital those
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of things I it's because have a
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
you have a building in beds so people
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
see right and then and more pressure
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
being pointed out to do more but if
 
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
there was places like that that some
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
place that they could actually go to if
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
you read the protective custody statute
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
it used to say that somebody was
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
intoxicated you actually brought them to
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
a place those places don't exist anymore
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
so that's why the jails are now what the
 
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
other option is so if you bring those
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
kind of places back that they're
 
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
intoxicated they're in Mental Health
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
crisis those kinds of things that they
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
can be treated properly they can't from
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
there they become they're too violent or
 
00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
they the crime says they have to go over
 
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
here but there is a huge faction over
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
that could go to place like that
 
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely can I get a followup Mr
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
followup yeah um and then in terms of
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner issue uh in your
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
experience and I don't want to have you
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
speak for the court but in your
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
experience having worked with the court
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
a lot um why is the court saying no to
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
issuing the payment to the bail
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners why is the court saying no
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
yeah well it's always been traditional
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
that the individual has to pay the the
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner codes fee for them I
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
think the court didn't want to pay the
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners because it costs them
 
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
it will cost money there and then they'd
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
have to go after the individual who
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
didn't pay the cost so means they're
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
going to need to have somebody going
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
after and getting those reimbursed back
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
can I get another followup to that quick
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah quick um wouldn't it make more
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
sense to have the court go after those
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
individuals then for them to Sure the're
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
only ones that have the the're the only
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
ones that can the bail commissioner
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
itself can't go
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
only on that would have the ability to
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
add to they could tax it on to their
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
restitution or anything else when they
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
went to court so there's what up more
 
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities there than there's a bail
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
single bail commissioner to do anything
 
00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman yeah
 
00:45:38.359 --> 00:45:40.349 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman yeah
representative

00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
Pratt uh electronic monitoring device do
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
they make one that monitors drugs and
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
alcohol they make multiple different
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
ones I know alcohol there definitely you
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
can do alcohol there's things you can do
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
with their cars those kinds of things
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Technology out there
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
there's some good
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
actually represent Pratt I just read an
 
00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
article yesterday where there's one that
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
does uh it does drug somehow it I don't
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
know how it does it but so I'm sure it
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
costs a pretty penny too representative
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I just have a quick question
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
about somebody who is arrested for
 
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
DWI and there are various degrees of
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
intoxication how how is that treated
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
when they come in to see the bail
 
00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:28.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner and or the judge and what
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
what happens to a
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
person for DWI yeah so depends a lot of
 
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:34.559 align:start position:0%
times DWI are actually handled right at
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
the police department with a bail
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner um but if they come to
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
us we see intoxicate people all the time
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
if they're able
 
00:46:46.549 --> 00:46:46.559 align:start position:0%
to speak coherently um we'll call bail
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner and they would just come in
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
sit down with them bail commissioner
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
goes all all the forms and all that kind
 
00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:53.079 align:start position:0%
of stuff what they're eligible for those
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
kinds of things sen upal court date most
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
of those lot lot of times are just set
 
00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.710 align:start position:0%
of those lot lot of times are just set
personal

00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:01.559 align:start position:0%
recogniz usually that you're promising
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
to show up at Court thank
 
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
you if the but if the person appears too
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
intoxicated to understand the terms of
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
the bail what what do you do then so a
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
couple things uh for uh for the jails we
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
probably would encourage the person to
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
just wait a little bit um but if they've
 
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
already seen a bail commissioner which
 
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes does happen and no bail is put
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
on because the person's not able to
 
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
participate once they so up they still
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity again to you want
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
to see bail commissioner cuz now you're
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
in your right State of Mind to see bail
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner so they still have that
 
00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.790 align:start position:0%
commissioner so they still have that
right

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
they're we'll say there's some rub with
 
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
some other law enforcement agencies and
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
stuff when you do do that because
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
they've already left but to be on the
 
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
safe side from almost all the jails be
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
like now we're the ones that have to
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
keep them and deal with them not other
 
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
outside agencies and I came from being a
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
full-time cop years ago so it's great i'
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
rest drop off and leave now I'm on the
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
other end I'm like oh it's not so great
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
when they have to stay um so we can get
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
them bail
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
um as best as possible because now
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
they're in the right State of Mind to
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
participate in that
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
process representative Stone thank you
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
in your experience how often do you see
 
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
violations of pre-trial release actually
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
having their bill revoked by the courts
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
after uh their incidents are documented
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
they're submitted obviously I would
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
assume there's a hearing that's held how
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
often are you seeing anyone's bail being
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
release talking bail or you talk pre you
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
said pre-trial because pre-trial is
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
different so got Bail uh not often
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
enough I I've seen people that you know
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
who violated their bail several times
 
00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:40.359 align:start position:0%
and come back and it's not revoked or
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
maybe increased of what they have to to
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
do I past several years I've
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
seen a rise of people able to do more
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
crimes and break their bail without
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
having consequences of having to and I'm
 
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
not an advocate just so you know of get
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
more people staying in jail my job is to
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
put myself out of business that's if I
 
00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
that's what it my job is to get people
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
corrected but at the same time the
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
frustration when you see somebody either
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
drive again or driving out the
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
suspension or going out committing
 
00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.150 align:start position:0%
suspension or going out committing
another

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
assault uh stealing again I know people
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
have considered the stealing now a low
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
level because it's you know they're
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
going for their drugs and stuff but when
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
they do it over and over again it's
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
still not it's not a victim of crime
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
somebody gets something stolen so we see
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of those repetitive over and over
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
and over again it takes a long time for
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
them finally them to revoke the bail
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have the ability to
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
track in other words you know how many
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
people are coming our repeat offenders
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
back to your facility are you able to
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
track the number of people that are for
 
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
example brought back while they're on
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
bail and then released again I don't
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
think we're able to track of I can tell
 
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
you who's come back we can track who's
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
come back in a facility it would be
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
difficult to track who's come back who's
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
on bail without actually opening
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
individual files okay
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative Ro thank you Mr
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you superintendent Henry
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
um chairman Roy basically just asked one
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
of the questions that I've been waiting
 
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:09.630 align:start position:0%
of the questions that I've been waiting
to

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
ask which was about
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh I guess for lack of better term re
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders if you will um and my
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
but my next question and I I realize
 
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:21.789 align:start position:0%
but my next question and I I realize
this

00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:21.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
is kind of a an opinion if you will
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
but we're hearing from from some bail
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and we're hearing you know
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
obviously from all all sorts of people
 
00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:33.079 align:start position:0%
testifying and one of the things we're
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
hearing is about
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies with with Bill
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
Commissioners so with that being said
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
and I don't know why I didn't ask
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else until now is there any kind
 
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
of a of a guideline where you know if
 
00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:50.839 align:start position:0%
the person has been arrested for XY or Z
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
that you know this is like the general
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
rule of thumb for Bale
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
or is it just really up to that bill
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
commissioner it's so I had a hard time
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
speaking for them because it's not
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
something that that our side really
 
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
deals with okay I can tell you from
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
years of experience yes some of it is up
 
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
to the individual bail commissioner they
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
do get training from the courts um to
 
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
try to be have them consistent but I do
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
not believe that there is a matrix per
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
se that says you do this as many times
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
you get X um so do I think there's way
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be more consistent
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
sure if the courts put something
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
together I think and I think we can all
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
follow a matrix or something along those
 
00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:32.839 align:start position:0%
lines if it was put together we do let
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
for a lot of things we do inside for our
 
00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:37.349 align:start position:0%
for a lot of things we do inside for our
assessments

00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
so let me have a followup and to follow
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
up with that and kind of piggy back on
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy's question it was far as
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know somebody was out on bail and
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
now they've been rearrested and one of
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
the questions that I had asked um
 
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
somebody previously was you know
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
somebody that was out and you know they
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
were told you know don't do drugs don't
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
do alcohol and now they're rearrested
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
and what was that number do you see a
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
larger percentage of people being
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
rearrested you know that you know within
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
you know I would say a close period of
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
time or do you see more of hey I kind of
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
got out of jail free card you know
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
waiting to go and see the judge or is it
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
is it just like this revolving door
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
because we're hearing both right see
 
00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:26.839 align:start position:0%
more revolving door people
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
get we'll put take this back to uh you
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
putting restraining order on it's just a
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
piece of paper says don't go do it and
 
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
we all and then people still go and
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
commit horrible crimes this piece of
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
paper says do not go drink do none that
 
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah and we they go do they go
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
do it anyways it's just a piece of paper
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
um so revolving door in short durations
 
00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:51.559 align:start position:0%
of time seen quite a few people back on
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
th especially those kinds of stuff
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
that's put on their bail form clarify
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
what I heard so basically what you're
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
saying is the piece of paper is just
 
00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
that and there really isn't any teeth to
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
what they're being what the conditions
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
are personal recogniz and bail is
 
00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a lot of teeth and it it's
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
just a promise that you're going to show
 
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
up to court bail cash bail it's I mean
 
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
it hurts a little more because you're
 
00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
going to be out of money so yeah it's
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
not again it's just a piece of paper
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
you're promising it does it work for
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
some people sure but do we see more come
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
in than not yes okay thank you thank you
 
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.030 align:start position:0%
in than not yes okay thank you thank you
very

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
much um you said you had um worked in
 
00:53:32.829 --> 00:53:32.839 align:start position:0%
other counties before um some of them up
 
00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
further up
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
north it's on my understanding that
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of police departments
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
out there well they don't even have
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
departments they just have like one guy
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
um how do they handle
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
transports do they leave their town and
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
go to the jail and their Town's just not
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
covered I mean or do you ever offer or
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
do the counties ever offer the ability
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
to go pick up that prisoner for them
 
00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
nine out of 10 times it's the town that
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
brings him in you know when I worked for
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
Whitefield PD way back when it was just
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
a one one car driving up to Coos County
 
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:05.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully another town we try to get him
 
00:54:05.559 --> 00:54:06.230 align:start position:0%
hopefully another town we try to get him
to

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
cover depending on what Sheriff's
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
Department you have some are more active
 
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
some are not um because they're more on
 
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
the Civil side sometimes they may have a
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
car that would work with that local PD
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
but most of the time it is just a local
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
PD coming to the jail which is also a
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
strain they're they want to get back on
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
their town as fast as possible mhm but
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
at the same time as a jail we need
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
paperwork done we need a bail set we
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
need all these other things so it's a
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
competing harms type thing sometimes you
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
know sometimes P just want to drop them
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
off and go you get a bail commissioner
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
well we can't because we're not the ones
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
that can tell what happened and
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
everything else and blah blah blah so
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
having more bail more bail Commissioners
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
readily available is a huge uh help for
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
those local Peds a lot of times we're
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
waiting for quite a long time and and
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
your town is not covered especially
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
those small towns
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
does the
 
00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
sheriff because you guys patrol all of
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County do do the sheriffs
 
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
have the ability to pick up coverage for
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
the town if they can't transport for
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
them I like to speak for the sheriff we
 
00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
don't you know I don't work for his
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
department but uh he does he have the
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
ability sure he does and he does work
 
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
Rockingham count in particular it's a
 
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
very large department so they actually
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
have some cars and they will work with
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
some of the local PES if they're around
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
but your other some of the smaller
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's departments again they're
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing civil stuff mon they may
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
have a car if they're lucky out in the
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
evening or even if they have one uh some
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
of the sheriff's department like where I
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
was before at Carroll County uh the
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
sheriff up there has partnered with
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
several towns and actually they pay to
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
have coverage through the Sheriff's
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
Department so there is some of that and
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
depending what hours they're doing I
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
don't know so there's hybrids out there
 
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.470 align:start position:0%
don't know so there's hybrids out there
different

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
things any further
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing seeing none we really
 
00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um if you could get that
 
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
information to me regarding the cost of
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
your program your pre-trial program I'd
 
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:00.039 align:start position:0%
be interested to see what that cost you
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
you ask share the transation oh you I st
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
do you have anyone else tathy not today
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay telepathy going on yeah okay so um
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else here that wanted to
 
00:56:21.039 --> 00:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else here that wanted to
testify

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
today seeing none we're going to just
 
00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
take 10 minutes to uh regroup and figure
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
out what we're going to do and then
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:58:23.710 align:start position:0%
 
again

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.720 --> 01:19:05.950 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
that will be all the witness testimony
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
we have for today so we're going to be
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
wrapping up shortly I just wanted to um
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the committee and
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
everyone else um I'm sure you feel the
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
same way I do the further we open this
 
01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
chest the more we find things popping
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
out at us that we had not participated
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
or no one has thought of um I'm
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
contemplating um asking the committee to
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
take one of these bail bills that we
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
have and create a study commission not a
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
committee that only has a year to come
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
up a
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
commission uh and call it a law
 
01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement Summit where we bring the
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
sheriffs the police the every the um the
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
defense bar the Attorney General
 
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
everyone that judges into a room
 
01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
and don't let them out until white smoke
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
comes out of the roof because there is
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
um such a disconnect between what
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
happens in different parts of the state
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
that your involvement in the criminal
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
justice system is almost like playing a
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
lottery um you could get lucky and win
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
or not and unfortunately we're talking
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
about people's lives we're talking about
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
victims we're talking about offending
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about everyone and um if
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
we even if we can't afford the best
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system in the country
 
01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
we can certainly afford an orderly one
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
and a uniform one and that would be the
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
goal I believe of this commission so
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
I'll be asking the commission I mean the
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
committee to consider that as one of the
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
bills that we have retained um I will be
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
scheduling a public hearing because it
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
is non gerine to the original one of the
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
bills so look for that coming up in the
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
very near future because we still are
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
under the deadline of having it out by
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
the beginning of November
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to make a comment
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
before I
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
close if not next week um Thursday and
 
01:21:01.709 --> 01:21:01.719 align:start position:0%
Friday we have two very um book days of
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
people coming to speak to us um we have
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
more people um from the counties who run
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
the pre-trial programs so we can
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
understand what that entails what it
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
costs um what a best practice might
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
be and just for
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
your future planning purposes the 20th
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
of October will be the last day we hear
 
01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
any witness testimony after that we will
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
definitely be having uh the remaining
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
several meetings will be to make sure we
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
have everything on paper and ready to
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
submit to the clerk I believe it's the
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
3rd of November we're going to meet as a
 
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
the full committee to offer our
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the full committee
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
for a vote so that's where I'm at um any
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns representative
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
rhods thank you Mr chairman I just
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that in chesher County we
 
01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
do have these diversion programs we have
 
01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
uh the pre- court we have the drug
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
diversion we have the youth diversion
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
you know depending on what age you you
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
find yourself starting to get into
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
trouble and they're working quite well I
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
I did send an email while we were
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
listening to superintendent Henry um
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
asking our County controller if he would
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
send me those parts of the budget in an
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
email I do have them at home I was just
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
hoping maybe they would come over while
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
we were sitting here and I will share
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
with the committee what program chesra
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
county has and their
 
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
cost um because if you know Rockman
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
county has a few he you know my
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
understanding was he was stating is
 
01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
they're working very well for for that
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
County as well so I will bring that and
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
share with the committee you know
 
01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:37.719 align:start position:0%
basically the cost and how many people
 
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
and so forth see if that's helpful yeah
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely that would be helpful I think
 
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:43.639 align:start position:0%
that we need to look at Best Practices
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
and whether they be in this state or not
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a fan of Reinventing wheels
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
so we need to look at the best practices
 
01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
across the state I'm not sure that the
 
01:22:55.629 --> 01:22:55.639 align:start position:0%
pre-trial um program will be something
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to reach into um with this
 
01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
it may be something that has to be dealt
 
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
within the study commission just because
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
of the expense and and um technical
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
nature versus the time we have left but
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's something that will be addressed I
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
think in that study commission a lot of
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
times you'll see a study commission
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
that'll say study the um the
 
01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
interoperability of uh criminal justice
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we're not going to do
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
that we're going to spell out exactly
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
what we want the study commission to
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
address bail substance abuse using the
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system to deal with
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
mental health things of that nature um
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
so there's that with that um I will see
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
weekends
