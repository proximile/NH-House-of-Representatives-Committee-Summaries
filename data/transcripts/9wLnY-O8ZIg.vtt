00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:08.310 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
so those would be the other things that
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
will be going on
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
which is why there's a lot going on
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
which is why i'm asking
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
if people can sort of decide if there
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
are particular things they're interested
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
in to work on
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
to help manage the workload
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
that will not be much between now and
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
august but will be significant
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
starting and part of that workload will
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
be public hearings
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
part of what you were provided was the
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing schedule that occurred 10
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
and a timeline
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
in regards to the public hearings those
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
occurred in
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
october 10 years ago
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
it would seem that public hearings
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
before the data release don't make much
 
00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:58.550 align:start position:0%
before the data release don't make much
sense

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
and it would appear to me that public
 
00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:01.750 align:start position:0%
and it would appear to me that public
hearings

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
immediately after the data release
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
probably don't make much sense
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
so october was a month that was selected
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
approximately 10 years ago
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
um so you were aware the process and i
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
would like committee input on this i
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
don't the process
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
last year was the public hearings
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
occurred in the county
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
and not all committee members attended
 
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:26.790 align:start position:0%
and not all committee members attended
them

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
what generally happened was there was
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
someone designated to
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
chair the public hearing in the county
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
and two other at least two other members
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
of the committee attended
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
so there were three committee members
 
00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:41.190 align:start position:0%
so there were three committee members
present

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
at public hearings if not more what
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
you look i'm thinking it was five but
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
maybe i just attended once but there
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
were five
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
i i went through the minutes and maybe
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
it was five i don't
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
recall so my my other recollection was
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
that a lot of those were simply
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
listening to people
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
talk about what they wanted in a
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
district and we did not have
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
the data at that point and i know that
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
people felt that that was particularly
 
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.790 align:start position:0%
people felt that that was particularly
unhelpful

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
unhelpful
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
both from our point of view and from
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
their point of view actually that's sort
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
of interesting because i read
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
all the minutes from the public hearing
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
and i didn't actually see that comment
 
00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.270 align:start position:0%
and i didn't actually see that comment
it

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
and you know the data will be available
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
programs out there that you can get that
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sure people will be getting to put
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
the data in
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
to have specific suggestions during
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
public hearings but public hearings
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
are public hearings so
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the first instance it would seem to
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
me that the process of having a public
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
hearing in the county
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
probably makes sense representative
 
00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.550 align:start position:0%
probably makes sense representative
smith

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
smith
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much madam
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
chair um i wonder if some of the
 
00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.510 align:start position:0%
chair um i wonder if some of the
confusion

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
that has come up in the past is the
 
00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.190 align:start position:0%
that has come up in the past is the
public

00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
thinking that those hearings will
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
provide an opportunity for them to know
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
what we plan to do and react to that
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
as if there were a bill that they're
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
reacting to rather than their
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
initiating comments to help educate us
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
about what they would like
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
and um and you know that's a significant
 
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.270 align:start position:0%
and um and you know that's a significant
difference

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh and uh in
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
point of how we communicate what our
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
goals are for those hearings we might
 
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.589 align:start position:0%
goals are for those hearings we might
help

00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
i've just been notified that sound is on
 
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
so apparently if you are listening to
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
the meeting which i'm assuming is live
 
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.589 align:start position:0%
the meeting which i'm assuming is live
streaming

00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
streaming
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
if it has been live streaming at all it
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
has been live streaming without audio we
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
had some technical difficulties here
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
at the meeting this was noticed as a
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
work session so we were able to proceed
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
with our discussion here and if you're
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
listening welcome
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
to our meeting this is the house special
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee on redistricting it is
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
june 29th and our apologies for the
 
00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.430 align:start position:0%
june 29th and our apologies for the
delay

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
delay
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that the i.t department
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
here at the state house was in this room
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning making sure
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
everything worked and of course it did
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
not when we went to start the meeting
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your patience if you're
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
joining us now
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
senator smith sorry for that
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
interruption no i'm
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm delighted to hear that but there
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
will be minutes
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
long of this meeting so that there were
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
people who were interested
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
but there will be minutes of the general
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
discussion that occurred there will not
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
be transcriptions of minutes for these
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
meetings right
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcguire thank
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
i was going to suggest that at public
 
00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:48.870 align:start position:0%
i was going to suggest that at public
hearings

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
we ought to have one or maybe two maps
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
that are at least close to as
 
00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
that are at least close to as
suggestions

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
because most people won't be able to
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
give you coherent comments without
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
something to look at
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
if you have say these you know these two
 
00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.349 align:start position:0%
if you have say these you know these two
maps

00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
maps
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
they both are are close they're not
 
00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:08.470 align:start position:0%
they both are are close they're not
final

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
but tell us what the problems or the
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
good points are we'd be able to get much
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
more useful feedback
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
and one would hope with the technology
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
since the program has already been
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
developed that once we get the numbers
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
in we can do that initial
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
as representative smith said sort of
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
this is where we would be
 
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
as as the maps are today and
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
highlight the districts that no longer
 
00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.470 align:start position:0%
highlight the districts that no longer
work

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
and maybe that might be a good starting
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
place because we all can understand what
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
our current district is
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
pretty easily the other thing is that in
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
in many cases
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
you have a part of a county where you
 
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.829 align:start position:0%
you have a part of a county where you
have

00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
two choices i mean i live in one and
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
there there's a town that's less than
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
one rep so it has to be joined and it
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
could be joined with either of two towns
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
which would give you a different pattern
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
but there's pluses and minuses to both
 
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.910 align:start position:0%
but there's pluses and minuses to both
plants

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
plants
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
and so we it would be useful to give the
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
public the choice or at least the
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
information to say
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
we have these two plants do you prefer
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
the one with the larger floaterial or
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
the spore
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
the smaller full material which is why i
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
decided on
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
the way to go but it's that's the sort
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
of thing people can look at
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
and understand a lot better than just
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
general comments thank you
 
00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:31.829 align:start position:0%
general comments thank you
representative

00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you i was wondering also um having
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
looked in the very initial stages of mr
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
anderson's program
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
last time around before it vanished and
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
we were not allowed to look at it
 
00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:44.550 align:start position:0%
we were not allowed to look at it
anymore

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
it was a wonderfully user-friendly
 
00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:49.349 align:start position:0%
it was a wonderfully user-friendly
program

00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
and i am wondering once the actual
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
census data gets put into the program
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
and before that it's not useful at all
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if a version of that might
 
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:03.349 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if a version of that might
be

00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
made available to the public through our
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
website so that public members can play
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
around with it just as
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
just as folks here could
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber that uh
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
issue has come up in discussions just so
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
but the discussions on that need to
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
continue there are copyright issues in
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
regards to the program
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
there are issues in regards to making
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh programming available to people
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
and how it is
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
controlled and whether or not
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
the program itself could be altered if
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
on a different platform which would make
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
the apparent generation of results not
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
consistent with the underlying
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
mathematical formula that
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
the program the original program had so
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
we have a number of issues that we're
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
discussing to try and
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
work things out i am aware that there
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
was all access
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
for committee members to the program
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
for some for a brief time or something
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
very brief okay
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
it was a very brief time and then and
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
then there was no further
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
access but it seems to me that um my
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
recollection was that at the time the
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
copyright belonged to the house and
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
therefore it
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
it would be up to the house as to um
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
how and under what circumstances it was
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
made available and
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
you certainly don't have to have the
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
public tied in
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
with the official version that's being
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
used for the official maps but
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
it might be something that would be very
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
helpful for people to be able to
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
get a feel for the kinds of issues we're
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with because
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
for many people it's it's easy to say
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
gee you know i want my town and the town
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
next to be together for good and
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
sufficient reasons
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
but it is not instantly apparent to them
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
that two towns over where representative
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
mcguire lives there's an issue where
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
there's a town that has to be attached
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
to one of two towns and there are no
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
other possibilities so
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
you know being able to get that feel
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
might be helpful for the public so i i
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
just would urge
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
um those discussions go on with an eye
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
to providing the maximum access possible
 
00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:28.550 align:start position:0%
to providing the maximum access possible
thanks

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so it's
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
software so copyright doesn't matter
 
00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
is the license agreement so for example
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
you can own a copy of software
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
and still not be allowed to modify it
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
you can own a copy of software and not
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
be allowed to distribute it
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
um so those are the things that we're
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
going to negotiate
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the license agreement and it would be
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
irresponsible me to say what the outcome
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
of that will be the intent though
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
is you all get it as many people as
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
possible get it one of the
 
00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.510 align:start position:0%
possible get it one of the
considerations

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
is how would the public get it
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
if we put it on the general court
 
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.750 align:start position:0%
if we put it on the general court
website

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
which isn't always state-of-the-art uh
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
what happens if
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
20 000 people log in today and try to
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
download software
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that will be possible
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
maybe there's some other way to
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
distribute it but that is our intent
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
and and what we're working on um i also
 
00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:29.030 align:start position:0%
and and what we're working on um i also
think

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
we should point out that we're having a
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
lot of discussions about when things
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
will happen
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
the one thing that's for sure you
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned working backwards from a
 
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.190 align:start position:0%
mentioned working backwards from a
deadline

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
that date is november 18th that's when
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
we will complete our work
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
so i kind of want that in everyone's
 
00:47:43.839 --> 00:47:44.390 align:start position:0%
so i kind of want that in everyone's
minds

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
minds
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
without a suspension of the rules um the
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
deadline for all committees to report
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
retained bills which these are
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
so keeping that in mind
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
in working backwards the public hearing
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
schedule needs to be before november
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
after data when there's some information
 
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.549 align:start position:0%
after data when there's some information
available

00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
so it really will sort of limit it
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
probably to the end of september
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
and data release is mid-august
 
00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:24.790 align:start position:0%
and data release is mid-august
representative

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you despite our experience today
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
with live streaming and zoom
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
i guess i would like to explore uh
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
having the county meetings accessible by
 
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.510 align:start position:0%
having the county meetings accessible by
zoom

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
zoom
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
for whatever because we have the
 
00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:42.950 align:start position:0%
for whatever because we have the
technology

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't always work perfectly but we
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
have that technology and i think it
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
would give
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
more people the opportunity to
 
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.950 align:start position:0%
more people the opportunity to
participate

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
at least and even if we can't make it
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
interactive at least they can
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
view it uh live stream and get a better
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
sense and i think the more transparency
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
we have it's hard for people to get to
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
meetings so
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
anyway that's what i would ask that we
 
00:49:06.079 --> 00:49:08.309 align:start position:0%
anyway that's what i would ask that we
consider

00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you that that is being considered
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
but the issue is also being considered
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not you can even
 
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.790 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not you can even
provide

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
those things in a consistent manner for
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
from county to county
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
the technology necessary to do it and
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
do you have public hearings that provide
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
a different platform in one
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
county to another there are lots of
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
issues but we appreciate that there has
 
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.349 align:start position:0%
issues but we appreciate that there has
been

00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
electronic access in the past the other
 
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.990 align:start position:0%
electronic access in the past the other
issue

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
there's a difference obviously between
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
live streaming and any interaction
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the clarification on
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
your part as to at least having it
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
available to
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
to look at being as compared to
 
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.510 align:start position:0%
to look at being as compared to
participation

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative smith thank you thank you
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair i know the goal is
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
november 18th and i also know
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
that sometimes in the fullness of time
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
it is not possible to act
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
responsibly carefully thoroughly
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
and follow a particular time
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
deadline and
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
i would hope that
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
as we have done on many occasions for
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
bills less significant than these
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
but still early enough for us to be able
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
all the other responsibilities thank you
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
as you're aware from my previous
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
comments the ability to waive the
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
deadlines as to a request has already
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
been discussed
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
um i always do better when there's a
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
hard deadline though and i think that
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
november 18th makes the most sense
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
um because at a certain point once the
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
data is out
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
decisions have to be made and to we'll
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
we'll see where it goes but
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
i think keeping november 18th as a goal
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
is is not a bad one though
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
i know certainly that the committee 10
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
years ago was meeting
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
i believe the last two weeks in december
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
so representative i guess i'm just a
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
little bit confused
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
i i thought that we were not likely to
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
get the
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
numbers from the cities until march or
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
something like that and so how are we
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
what what could possibly lead you to be
 
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.470 align:start position:0%
what what could possibly lead you to be
confused

00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
confused
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
how are we how are we finishing the work
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
in november if we don't understand that
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
you don't see clearly how we're going to
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
get all this done
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
yeah part of the problem representative
 
00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:47.190 align:start position:0%
yeah part of the problem representative
will

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair i it seems like
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
there's some consensus here that
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
having public hearings in each county
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
makes sense that we should be really
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
committed to that
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
seems like there's some questions on
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not we'll be able to provide
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
public access via zoom or allow people
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
to testify remotely
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know that there's a lot of
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
confusion about that i don't expect
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
that's probably going to happen
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay i'm wondering if similar to the
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
state budget
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
and and testifying on the state budget
 
00:52:17.839 --> 00:52:18.549 align:start position:0%
and and testifying on the state budget
uh

00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
if we might be able to provide one or
 
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.710 align:start position:0%
if we might be able to provide one or
two

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
evenings where the public can zoom in
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
to provide their perspective on
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
how these maps are going to be drawn um
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
i don't anticipate that um we can
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
certainly discuss it but that would need
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
to be approved by the speaker's
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
office in regards to the process and i
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
will tell you that
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
um while i appreciate public comment and
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
we want as much
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
public participation as possible having
 
00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:50.950 align:start position:0%
public participation as possible having
run

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
run
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
some fairly large hearings both
 
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.950 align:start position:0%
some fairly large hearings both
electronically

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
and in person i have concerns about
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
being able to allocate
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
the appropriate time to new hampshire
 
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.349 align:start position:0%
the appropriate time to new hampshire
residents

00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
residents
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
in regards to their concerns and the
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
monitor that on an electronic platform
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
i think we've seen massive interests in
 
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.230 align:start position:0%
i think we've seen massive interests in
this

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
much different than 10 years ago and i
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
think for the committee our timeline
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
and the work we need to figure out what
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
the best way
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
is to provide our representatives and
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
the house the input of the people we
 
00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:32.230 align:start position:0%
the house the input of the people we
represent

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
so that's the concern just follow up uh
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering if we can explore ways
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
to limit
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh public participation to new hampshire
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
residents because i agree with you i
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
share that concern
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
that would be impossible because anybody
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
could say they lived anywhere
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
and it's really easy to do i mean that's
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
just the reality and
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
i'd like to think that people wouldn't
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
do that but i need to tell you that
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
there might be other people in this room
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
that have some experience with the fact
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
that people
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
would do that and i meant that not for
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
my profession
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
not from being a legislator i meant that
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
from being a lawyer so
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative smith thanks i think
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
we're skipping a step
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of funny because this is
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
the context the conversation's happening
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
at remember there is one representative
 
00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.030 align:start position:0%
at remember there is one representative
for

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
roughly every 3 300 people in the state
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
i would hope that whether they're on the
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
committee or not
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
all members of the house would be
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
talking to their constituents about it
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
and they have a direct line to this
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee right because
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
your colleagues will contact you and say
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
look here's what a majority
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
of my constituents said i feel like
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
when we have this there's how many of us
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
are there
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
15 15 and we're trying to prioritize how
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
to get the whole state to talk to these
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
15 people
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
that that's not what the new hampshire
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
house is about
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
i plan on holding meetings in a couple
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
of my towns so they're easy to get to to
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
talk to people about this
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know and the question is what's not
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
working for you and
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
what is and i will bring that
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
information back to the committee
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that if we all did that
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
people wouldn't have to go very far to
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
go to a meeting and they have access to
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
us right now they can email us there's a
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
phone number that they can call
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
the contents of those phone calls will
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
be logged and documented
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
i i think we're pretty accessible so
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
if people aren't thinking that
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of the work is not going to happen
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
in this room that we're all going to log
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of miles talking to people
 
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
that maybe that's what we ought to get
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
our heads around all right um i i didn't
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
mean that to sound as scolding as it
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
came out i'm hearing my tone and my
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
voice and i apologize for that
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's all right and i you know i
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
need to clarify representative smith's
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
comments on the phone call um there will
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
be access
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
on line i am not i i'm not sure that's
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
accurate um representative weather
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to clarify that same point
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
because if somebody is thinking that
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
phone calls made to my house are
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
are logged and documented in any kind of
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
way that's available to the public
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
other than the envelope that i scribbled
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
the note on
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
while i was cooking dinner and threw
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
into a file somewhere
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
our our process is is a little more
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
informal than almost anywhere else in
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
i was thinking of what representative
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
smith said and i know that
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
i have at least one old home day to
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
present to my constituent i wonder if it
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
would be possible to get county level
 
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.030 align:start position:0%
would be possible to get county level
maps

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
maps
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
so that we can draw the lines and show
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
people what the issues are
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
um i would think counties would have
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
that um we can check on that though for
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
you that mean like the one on the
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
on the state website that just shows the
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
all right if you want to email those
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
kind of requests into me and then i can
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
copy staff and we can see what we can
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
get you
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's all right we'll take that you
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
could have just said oh
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
your question's been answered i would
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
have felt great that we took care of
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
something representative weber as as a
 
00:57:23.599 --> 00:57:24.309 align:start position:0%
something representative weber as as a
follow-up

00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
to representative mcguire's suggestion i
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
think having
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
house level maps that show the current
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
districts and the current floaterial
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
districts available would be very
 
00:57:35.599 --> 00:57:38.789 align:start position:0%
districts available would be very
helpful

00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
there is such a map i've got one but
 
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:41.910 align:start position:0%
there is such a map i've got one but
it's

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
but but the county is all you really
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
well i i think the issue is we'll work
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
on putting a link to those maps on the
 
00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:51.829 align:start position:0%
on putting a link to those maps on the
website

00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
um and then people can go to them and if
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
you're holding an event you can then
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
log on to it right then and there and
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
that might eliminate the issue of having
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
to get back to people in regards to
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
specific events
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the reason why we
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
have cam sitting here so
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
she can help me remember to get those
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
requests into it
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
to link to the website
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
except that we need need to have
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
something like a pdf because
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
i know my old home days don't have
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
anything like internet connectivity
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we're gonna need
 
00:58:25.599 --> 00:58:30.390 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we're gonna need
printouts

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
all right the last two remaining things
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
given the current status
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it makes sense for us
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
to have a meeting before
 
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
august i want your feedback on that i'm
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
going to be working with representative
 
00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.549 align:start position:0%
going to be working with representative
bergeron

00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
bergeron
 
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm as i said hopefully a couple of
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
others of you in regards to the city
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
processes so we know exactly where they
 
00:58:59.119 --> 00:58:59.349 align:start position:0%
processes so we know exactly where they
are

00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe getting that nailed down
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
before the data comes out in august
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
there will be meetings that will occur
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
with the senate in regards to nailing
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
down the process
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
so i am thinking that august probably is
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
when it makes sense to meet again and
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
the question will become whether we meet
 
00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:17.510 align:start position:0%
the question will become whether we meet
before

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
the 16th or afterwards and it might make
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
sense to me before the 16th
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
because by then the details of how
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
things are going to occur
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
like you've asked us to hopefully will
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
have nailed down
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime if you can send
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
emails to myself
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
we can try to get responses out i want
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
to know whether any committee member
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
due to meeting in july as compared to
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
august and that way you can all plan for
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative madam chair do you have a
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
sense of the frequency
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh of our meetings in august i'm just
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if we might be able to
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
develop some sort of a calendar i
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
understand that i've been asked to do a
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
calendar representative turcotte didn't
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
have enough time
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
to adjust his schedule um we'll try to
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
figure that out but
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
frankly i don't really know how we're
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
going to be using the program
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
yet so until i get that figured out i i
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
mean we don't want to meet and not
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
have anything and i need to figure out
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
some communication for
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're going to have a
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
group a work session in regards to the
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
electronics of the map and how we're
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
going to do that
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
the county meetings are going to be you
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
know time for people and i'm mindful of
 
01:00:36.319 --> 01:00:36.710 align:start position:0%
know time for people and i'm mindful of
that

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
so i am going to try and do a schedule
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
for meetings but
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
at this point i don't know exactly how
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
much the meeting how
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
often we'll be meeting because that's
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat dependent on the division with
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative weber i'm having a hard
 
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
time understanding the utility of having
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
a meeting before
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
the data comes out
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that it would be
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
much more useful to have a meeting
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
subsequent to the data coming out later
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
in august
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
well it see the reason i say before
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
august is that i'm hoping by then people
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
will have some feedback from
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
constituents or old home days
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
so that when we come back for a meeting
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
in august i don't want to be having a
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
meeting in august with the data out
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
without having maps and
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to do maps
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
unless we've had some input into what
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
the committee expects to see
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
because so i don't maybe we have two
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
meetings then
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i viewed the meeting before
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
the data release as being a preamble to
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
what you wanted to see
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
after the data was released we can meet
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
after august
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
if the committee consensus is what we
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
want to see is as representative smith
 
01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:53.349 align:start position:0%
want to see is as representative smith
said

01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
the map with the current districts
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the deviation calculations as they
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
would exist if the
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
districts stayed exactly the same to
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
give us a base point for going forward
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
that would be the map that you would see
 
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
if i may follow up yeah i i'm still
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
unclear of the purpose of a meeting
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
before the data is out because it seems
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
to me that then
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
all we have is anecdotal
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
information of i spoke to somebody
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
at a town hall meeting and they're
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
concerned about this or that
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
but we can do that just as easily after
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
the data's come out
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
and and having the
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
preferences without the data available
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
seems to me that we're putting a lot of
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
work in in a direction that we may not
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
be able
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
to go in because the numbers aren't
 
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.270 align:start position:0%
to go in because the numbers aren't
there

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
to do it that way okay thank you for
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
your input we'll
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
make a decision representative smith hi
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
resident monkey wrench thrower um there
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
might be value for one meeting we nail
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
down the software get the user license
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
worked out and agree this is what we're
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
without the data in there representative
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
weber attendance will not be required
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
if we decide to have a meeting thank you
 
01:03:20.799 --> 01:03:21.190 align:start position:0%
if we decide to have a meeting thank you
yeah

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
we can use the old data to learn how to
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
use the software
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's what i talked about in regards to
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
getting a map so we see where the
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
deviations are because i don't know if
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
any of you have had the same experience
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
i've had
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
i've had another number of reps come up
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
to me and say
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
and that you will find when you do a lot
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
of your research on district trying um
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
is what you find is what drives a lot of
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
what ends up being the product is people
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
who are in there
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
keeping things the same for them
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
so that's been sort of entertaining for
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
me to see who's come up has anybody else
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
had that happen
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i've had someone say please
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
change all right i have
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
one more thing i'd like to do before we
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
end this meeting does anybody else have
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
any other business
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
all right um pam could you come up here
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
come on up for those of you who don't
 
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
know this woman that i am asking to
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
come up here her name is cam smarlett
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
she has
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
been the roots of the tree
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
that are all things election for how
 
01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.390 align:start position:0%
that are all things election for how
long

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
long
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
32 years 32 years so when we talk about
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
having somebody 10 years ago
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
20 years ago when you're the chair of a
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
committee or process
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is the woman that really is the
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
person to whom
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
you're looking um i'm taking it a little
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
personally that she's retiring during my
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
term as chair of election law and chair
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the redistricting commission
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
and i will note that we referred to joel
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
who actually used to be in the same
 
01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
who actually used to be in the same
office

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
and he retired last year so
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
this is clearly a conspiracy on staff in
 
01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
all things election because i suspect
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
contracting them both for services over
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
i think the truth of the matter is is
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
with covid you will note that the fourth
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
floor has been blocked to access for
 
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.309 align:start position:0%
floor has been blocked to access for
legislators

01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
and staff and joel and pam's
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
shared the office that was right by the
 
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.109 align:start position:0%
shared the office that was right by the
staircase

01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
staircase
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
where all the legislators were going up
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
and down
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
all day long like bunnies hopping up and
 
01:05:49.119 --> 01:05:49.670 align:start position:0%
all day long like bunnies hopping up and
down

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
and asking questions they were the first
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
line that people got
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i think after a year of not having
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
us up there
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
she wanted out because i heard they're
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
going to let the elevator go to the
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
fourth force
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
so so um i had a chance to speak to
 
01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
david cody
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
a former chair of the election law
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
committee and i know this is not the
 
01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:12.559 align:start position:0%
election law but
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
has been involved in an election and
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
redistricting things
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
and also to representative hozel from
 
01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.270 align:start position:0%

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
who is a prior chair and uh
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
they along with myself uh wish you
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
the best in your retirement um you have
 
01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:29.750 align:start position:0%

been

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
a support like none other for this
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
committee and i will tell you
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
among chairs we all say we have the best
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
committee researcher and assistant but
 
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:41.910 align:start position:0%
