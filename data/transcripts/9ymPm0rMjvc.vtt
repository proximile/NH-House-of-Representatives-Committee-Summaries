00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
officers and those permitted under
 
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.710 align:start position:0%
officers and those permitted under
statute

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
i know that some of you are wondering
 
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
why such an amendment would be offered
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
when the act
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
known as hr1 now s1 reportedly
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
only affects elections and voting for
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
federal offices of the congress it is
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
offered for
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
two reasons the first is to oppose this
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
large expansion of federal governments
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
while some say the federal government
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
has the right to govern the federal
 
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.469 align:start position:0%
has the right to govern the federal
elections

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
leaders specifically scholars dispute
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
the breadth of that authority
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
and irony the constitution to give
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
primary authority for elections to the
 
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.189 align:start position:0%
primary authority for elections to the
state

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
but allow congress to make her alter
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
such regulations
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
and it is that regulatory authority
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
which is being interpreted
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
as expansively as possible to override
 
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
what states currently provide the second
 
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.430 align:start position:0%
what states currently provide the second
reason

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
is because history tells us that this
 
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.270 align:start position:0%
is because history tells us that this
legislation

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
will not just affect federal laws both
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
the national national voter registration
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
act and the health american vote act
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
were to address federal office yes both
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
of those became
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
major state issues new hampshire
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
received an exemption from those
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
acts but the possibility of receiving an
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
exemption from
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
s-1 at this time given the
 
00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:42.790 align:start position:0%
s-1 at this time given the
implementation

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
date proposed and the fact the bill
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
restricts jurisdiction
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
for disputes over the act to the
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
washington dc district court
 
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:55.759 align:start position:0%
only makes an exemption unlikely
 
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
owen and by the way washington dc will
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
become a state
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
i have with me a copy of the for the
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
people's act
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
of 2021 it is over 800 pages
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
addressing voting campaign financing and
 
00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:14.629 align:start position:0%
addressing voting campaign financing and
ethics

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
while all important issues in the
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
election i speak today to
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
some of the provisions regarding voting
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
and how it will affect the
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
camp as fund eliminates voter id
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
requirements over 75 percent of
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
americans support voter i.t requirements
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
and the majority of our residents
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
support it and we have such a law
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
it will no longer be applicable if s1
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
passes so
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
what do we do s1 provides for the
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
registration of persons
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
at the age of 16 a proposal heard by
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
this committee in prior years
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
and rejected by the people's
 
00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:51.269 align:start position:0%
and rejected by the people's
representatives

00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
s1 has automatic voter online
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
registration with opt-out provisions
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
a proposal heard by this committee and
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature in recent years and
 
00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:02.550 align:start position:0%
the legislature in recent years and
rejected

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
rejected
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
this will be a major change providing
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
the providing of services at all levels
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
of our state and communities it will be
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
at great cost
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
and while there is money that is
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
allegedly associated with the act who
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
knows how much it could be
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
it will have to be applied for a branch
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
process will have to be gone through
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
when it's reported and accepted
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
it is contingent on unspecified terms
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
and conditions of the federal government
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
s-1 has voted that occurs over weeks
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
weeks it's in direct opposition to our
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
constitution which provides that
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
we have an election day and on that day
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
the votes
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
are to be counted and the results are to
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
be publicly declared by the moderator
 
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
at each polling place on the night after
 
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
the election
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
close with s1 our communities will have
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
to begin to
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
allow voting at least 15
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
days before election day and then
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
continue to receive
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots for 10 days after
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
election day
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
our elections are run in new hampshire
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
in our communities by
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
our clerk elected moderators and
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
supervisors with
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
volunteers how is this process going to
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
be managed in your community how will it
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
be stacked how will it be paid for
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
as one also provides that polling places
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
need to remain open for at least 10
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
hours a day during the early voting
 
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.230 align:start position:0%

for weeks of voting
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
and be open for such extended hours
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
as one also provides for no excuse
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
absentee voting
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
our constitution doesn't have such a
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
provision and after
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
three attempts to change the
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
constitution you
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
still are supposed to have a disability
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
in order to vote absentee
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
the broad exemption of november 2020

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
to a specific emergency order that is
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
not no longer applicable
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
and additionally it was still not no
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
excuse absentee voting
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
do we charge our election officials if
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
s1 passes
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
to run our elections in direct violation
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
of our constitution
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
s1 requires the mailing of an
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
application for an absentee voter for
 
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
application for an absentee voter for
all

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
voters that check those 60 days prior to
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
the election
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
it requires prepayment for mailings out
 
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.269 align:start position:0%
it requires prepayment for mailings out
and

00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
from potential voters and it requires
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
drop boxes to be available 45 days
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
before elections for ballot drop-off
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
our communities are going to pay for
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
those items
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
most communities have started to work on
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
their budget for next year
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
how is that going to be paid for and the
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
ballot dropbox procedure is one that has
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
been considered
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
and rejected by the new hampshire
 
00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.829 align:start position:0%
and rejected by the new hampshire
legislature

by the new hampshire superior court just
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%

litigation brought by the american
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
federation of teachers
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
as the primary plaintiff who asked that
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
the court
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
ordered the state to implement those
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
provisions in 2020.
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
that request was rejected in the
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
the court recognized that our processes
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
and procedures were
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate in light of our constitution
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
and state laws
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a process for election
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
that has worked for our communities
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
do some people say changes can be made
 
00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:11.190 align:start position:0%
do some people say changes can be made
yes

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
does that require upending the entire
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
process that has been adopted and
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
prescribed by our constitution no in
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
april 2020 the unh survey center
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
released polling data
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
that provided that 90 percent of our
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
voters said it was
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
easy or some likely to vote and they
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
were overwhelmingly profited
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
in the processing of the election
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
ballots and results
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has placed in the top
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
three of all states and voter
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
participation rates for the last
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
four presidentials some say this
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
amendment will cause us to have two
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
elections and i disagree
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment is only making clear what
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
proponents so that's what
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
say is the case it affects voting for
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
federal offices only
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
it is s one that is forcing the states
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
if they need to to have two electric
 
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.629 align:start position:0%
if they need to to have two electric
processes

00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
processes
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
not this amendment as to how to
 
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.389 align:start position:0%
not this amendment as to how to
implement

00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
voting next year should estimate pass
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
being up to our chief election officer
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
and the legislature at that time and
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
step out of government as it always
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
has but pending that it should not be
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
directed to our state
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
i present to you that s1 will have a
 
00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:24.550 align:start position:0%
i present to you that s1 will have a
dramatic

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
dramatic
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
and unconstitutional impact on our
 
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.670 align:start position:0%
and unconstitutional impact on our
elections

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
and i strongly disagree with our sitting
 
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
and i strongly disagree with our sitting
senator

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
who has said that it really doesn't
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
change the way new hampshire would run
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
its elections
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
i choose to give us an opportunity to
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
charter force that will allow us to
 
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.629 align:start position:0%
charter force that will allow us to
conduct

00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
our elections in a manner that has
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
produced the high voter
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
participation rates confidence in the
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
conduct and a process that voters
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
find it easy to navigate and if you're
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
concerned about the impact of
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
s1 with this amendment i suggest you
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
call the federal delegation
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
while two members of our technical
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
delegation have already voted for it
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
two still have the opportunity to stand
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
in washington supported by financial
 
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.430 align:start position:0%
in washington supported by financial
voters

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
and our negative constitution they
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
should be voting
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
no on s1 but i ask that you vote yes
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
the freedom to vote
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
and ensure elections are safe and
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
accurate and accessible
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the for the people act is essential
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
to restoring the public's faith in our
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
democratic institutions and ensuring
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
everyone's voice and vote is heard
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
counted and protected and so today's
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
hearing i think
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just going to say is a i think
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
is a political extent nothing more
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
um it is an attempt to spread
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
misinformation and undermine our
 
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.350 align:start position:0%
misinformation and undermine our
democracy

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
and as a young leader in our state um i
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
hear it constantly how our
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
broken our government is i mean i've
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
heard elected elected leaders say that
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
we can't even trust our own government
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
um and it's just ignoring the clear
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
unworkable nature of this proposal and
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
by that i mean i have
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know creating two separate systems
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
it is disturbing to me
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
that some of my colleagues would go to
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
such great lengths to just
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
target one piece uh one piece of
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
legislation so
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
we should be working on implementing
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
things like electro electronic poll
 
00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:37.270 align:start position:0%
things like electro electronic poll
books

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
books
 
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
online voter registration not wasting
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
our time on this silly amendment
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
i think um you know for us this sb 89 is
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
actually a bipartisan bill
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
and it's a pro voter bill that would
 
00:19:49.919 --> 00:19:50.470 align:start position:0%
and it's a pro voter bill that would
actually

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
improve our absentee ballot um pre-k
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh pre-processing process and curing so
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
i think you know a lot as it is is a
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
good bill but
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
adding this amendment would be would be
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
detrimental to
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and then i would also add that
 
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.590 align:start position:0%
this bill and then i would also add that
i

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
i respect the chair uh of the committee
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
but i would also say that we um
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has not was not in the top
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
three in last year's uh
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
election turnout um you know states like
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
i think it was maine colorado um
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
i think it was minnesota that was the or
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
was yeah minnesota were the highest
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
last year so although we like to tell
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves that we are and we are an
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
active participant we're in the top 10
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
every four years um but like these
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
states are taking measures
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
to actually improve access to the ballot
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
box and we should be doing the same
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
so um and i'll i'll end with saying that
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
this bill would not
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
immediately happen overnight this isn't
 
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
like a okay where
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
automatically everything changes there
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
are provisions in the
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh in shr1 and s1 that would make it so
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
you know there would be timelines that
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have that we would be
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
putting in
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
i'll but all in my my testimony there
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%

thank you representative taking my
 
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.990 align:start position:0%
thank you representative taking my
question

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
please help me understand because i
 
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't quite see it
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
how this how hr1
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
and s1 by relaxing motor id requirements
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
requirements that help to ensure voter
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
integrity tell me how that
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
gets rid of doc money and politics i'm
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
confused on that maybe you can enlighten
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
how that does that
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
i mean this isn't a one thank you for
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
the question this isn't
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
one just one piece i mean voting
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
voting is i mean you know elections are
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
not just comprised of one specific act
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is this is a hundred percent this
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
is you know there are many parts to it
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
um so i in my in my view
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know making sure that we have you
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
know fair
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
that we have transparent elections and
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
seeing how much you know seeing where
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
where how candidates are funded is
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
incredibly important important to our
 
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.789 align:start position:0%
incredibly important important to our
electorate

00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
electorate
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
um now i don't think you know
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
i think voter right uh will you know
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
making sure that people have access to
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
the right to vote is a whole other part
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
but you know transparency in how our
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
electeds get funded
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
is they'll come is another important
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
part of our election system
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
um but like i said it's not just you
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
know elections aren't just one thing
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
um they they're comprised of many
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
different variables that go into
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
elections as you know as you probably
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
had to raise money but you also
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
had to turn people out when we when we
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
all got elected so
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and you probably told folks to just
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
remember to show up
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
with the necessary requirements for for
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
voting but
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
you know it's nothing in this as we all
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
like to do new hampshire we don't like
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
to be siloed off there are many
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
but there are many different aspects to
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
this so
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to interrupt uh mr chairman
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
but i i've i've gotten some
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
reports from from members that are
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
accessing the meeting by
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
zoom that it's difficult to hear the the
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
people in the committee room
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
if you can just be mindful of where the
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
microphones are
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
and make sure you're you're talking
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
you're near one when you're speaking
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's a little soft i
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
mean i can
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
call for tech support to come turn
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
things up if you're near a mic
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really sound um like you are
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for letting me know you
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
gotta follow up
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh mr chair and
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives taking the
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative are you aware of any
 
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.390 align:start position:0%
uh representative are you aware of any
um

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
voter in your hampshire in the last
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
election that uh wanted to vote that
 
00:23:51.919 --> 00:23:52.789 align:start position:0%
election that uh wanted to vote that
wasn't

00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
given the chance to vote either by
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot or invoke balloting are
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
you aware of any specific instance of
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
that happening in new hampshire
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
so yeah um it's funny you mentioned that
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
i've heard of people being turned
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
away for being registered being able to
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
register to vote
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
because of misinformation that um that
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
the person that the the person with the
 
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.669 align:start position:0%
the person that the the person with the
registrant

00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
for example there were
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
newly naturalized citizens who were
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
being told oh
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%

know person you know it's an important
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
day in their lives but not everybody
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
remembers that day and because they
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
they were told oh you can't register um
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
and because of that they were denied
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
their right to vote
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
you can't be given an absentee ballot or
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
sorry an affidavit if you're not a

and if you can't get registered so there
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%

appreciate the affidavit process but
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's not as clear and cut as we all like
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%

which encompasses the city of keene at
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
large i'm here to testify against the
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
anti-for the people
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to sb 89
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
it is nothing but a voter suppression
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
tactic guys
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
as a concern about the very popular for
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
the people act
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
the support for the provisions in the
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
for the people act are widespread
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
because people want to restore
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
faith in democratic institutions and
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
assure that everyone's voice is heard
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment before you today by
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
creating separate
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
elections and procedures for state and
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
county elections will do the opposite
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
it will make it harder and more
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
confusing for people to vote
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
and disenfranchise folks across the
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
board but especially those who are
 
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
already more vulnerable to
 
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.269 align:start position:0%
already more vulnerable to
disenfranchisement

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
including our state's young people as a
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
representative for keen
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
many of my constituents are college
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
students at keene state college and
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
antioch university
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
these are young folks who may be voting
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
for just the first or second time
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
and will be more likely to be confused
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
and hampered by two separate sets of
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
elections and registration procedures
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
we want young people to be greeted
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
warmly into the democratic system
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
so they will be lifelong voters and
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
contributors to our civic life
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
not turned away by red tape to become
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
cynical disbelievers
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
in our system of elections finally as a
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
state rep who is also going through the
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
budget process right now
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that the
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
provisions in this amendment will likely
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
cost money to implement
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
as we know the budget is already
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
incredibly lean and does not fund the
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
critical social services
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
needed by granite staters to instead
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
spend money on anti-democratic voter
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
suppression procedures is an affront to
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
granite staters
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
and not in the best entrance of my
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
constituents or any of the citizens of
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%

00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
will not be taking questions today
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%

before the committee today
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
commitment uh
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%

presidential primary
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
today was the awards ceremony before the
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
governor council and he is
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
currently attending that uh uh
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair may be interested to know
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
that that the winner was a 14 year old
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
from goffstown
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
and that person is getting their award
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh as we speak
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
um with that he has asked me to testify
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh on behalf of
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
the office and uh
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
and we are appearing in support of
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment sponsored by uh
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
h.r 1 or sr s1
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
from our standpoint is a federal
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
takeover of
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
the state's election process and
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
after reading through the bill uh in its
 
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.470 align:start position:0%
after reading through the bill uh in its
entirety

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
entirety
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
it is quite clear that if s1 were to
 
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.149 align:start position:0%
it is quite clear that if s1 were to
pass

00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
it would change every every uh
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
area of our election process and really
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
it would not be recognizable
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
uh in the future compared to what we
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
have today and
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
i think representative griffin did a
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
great job
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh explaining some of the things that
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
were in the bill but the bill is far
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive than that
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
um just a general statement before we
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
start you know the election process
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
has to work for all voters and
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
if there is a delicate balance that we
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
have to find
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
between uh making sure that it's easy to
 
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.789 align:start position:0%
between uh making sure that it's easy to
vote

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
and also making sure that that the vote
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
is secure
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
that we that we reduce the risk as much
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
as possible
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
for fraud to take place the other side
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
of that is yeah we don't want to
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
enact policies that that
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
if we go too far in either direction
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
then we have a vast group of voters
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
who lose confidence in the election
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
because number one they either believe
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
voter suppression is taking place
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
or the other side of that is that
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
the fraud is rampant because it's too
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
easy for people to get on the checklist
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and exercise their right to vote
 
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.549 align:start position:0%
and uh and exercise their right to vote
so

00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
from an administrative standpoint we we
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
approach this with trying to find that
 
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.070 align:start position:0%
approach this with trying to find that
balance

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
where the the laws that we enact
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
are adequate enough so that the most
 
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:49.990 align:start position:0%
are adequate enough so that the most
people

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
as reasonably possible have confidence
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
that their vote is going to
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
be counted and and and that it is not
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
unduly burdensome for them to cast that
 
00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:04.389 align:start position:0%
unduly burdensome for them to cast that
vote

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
um just uh
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
jumping over to hr1 quickly that the
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
title of the act
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm referring to hr one because uh
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
our office did a briefing with the local
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
election officials
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
we put together a powerpoint um and
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
madame chair i believe that
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
you have a copy of that that you may be
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
able to make available to members of the
 
00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:26.630 align:start position:0%
able to make available to members of the
committee

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh if the committee members do not
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
already have that but i would point out
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
that the title
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
of the act is to expand americans access
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
to the ballot box
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the influence of big money in
 
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.350 align:start position:0%
reduce the influence of big money in
politics

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
politics
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
strengthen ethics rules for public
 
00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:43.110 align:start position:0%
strengthen ethics rules for public
servants

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
servants
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
other corruption measures for the
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of fortifying our democracy
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
and for other purposes that sounds great
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
and and i think that's
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
that is a general statement that we
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
should all strive for
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
the act itself as was mentioned
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
earlier is is very broad and addresses a
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
number of very large
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
topics it's broken down into divisions
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
division a
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
is related to voting division b
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
is related to campaign finance and
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
division c
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
again a different subject matter our
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
comments are related to division a which
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
the um and and when we talk about
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
division a there there are things in
 
00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.110 align:start position:0%
division a there there are things in
that

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
in that bill that are good i mean we're
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
not going to
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going to deny that there are
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
some things in that legislation that new
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire already does
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
like same-day voter registration uh
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
there are provisions in there that deal
 
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
with electronic poll books
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
online voter registration portals and
 
00:33:55.679 --> 00:33:56.630 align:start position:0%
online voter registration portals and
increased

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
increased
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
accessible voting opportunities for
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
and those are all areas that our office
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
is currently working on
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
with the input of the legislature there
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
are bills pieces of legislation moving
 
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.550 align:start position:0%
are bills pieces of legislation moving
through

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
our state legislature that deal with
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
those topics
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
that we are supportive of and we expect
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
that in the near future
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to be implementing some of
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
those provisions
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
um but as we get into further into the
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh the bill uh there are
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
statements of findings made by congress
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
and on page 20 of hr1
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
congress has made the finding that
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
states and localities
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
eroded access to the right to vote
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
through restrictions on the right to
 
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.750 align:start position:0%
through restrictions on the right to
vote

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
including excessively onerous voter
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
identification requirements
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
burdensome voter registration procedures
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
voter purges
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
limited and unequal access to voting by
 
00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.750 align:start position:0%
limited and unequal access to voting by
mail

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
mail
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
polling place closures unequal
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
distribution of election resources
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
and other impediments and i would
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
challenge any member of this committee
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
or the legislature
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
to to point to one of those areas that
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
is problematic
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
much of the material i would go over is
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
is in that
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
powerpoint the the pages from that are
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
taken directly from the text
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh when you put everything
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
together that is contained in that
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
we have major concerns about creating
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities for ballot harvesting
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
which has been problematic in some other
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
states in the past
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the provisions in there we believe
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
also make it
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh more difficult to maintain an
 
00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.150 align:start position:0%
uh more difficult to maintain an
accurate

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
checklist of voters that are eligible to
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
vote making it
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
too easy to get unqualified voters on
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
the checklist
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
and this this bill makes it more
 
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
difficult to remove voters
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
that are unqualified uh if it's
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
determined that
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem there so with
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
that mr chair i will
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh stop and be happy to answer any
 
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.510 align:start position:0%
uh stop and be happy to answer any
questions

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh mr deputy
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
um do you agree that the passage of this
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
amendment would require
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
um separating uh the federal and state
 
00:36:35.839 --> 00:36:38.310 align:start position:0%
um separating uh the federal and state
elections

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
for ballot purposes uh that would be one
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
what would the other options be uh that
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
we have different ballots and different
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
checklists on the day of the election
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh can i have a further question mr
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
chairman for one more
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh one more uh well in that
 
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.990 align:start position:0%
thank you uh one more uh well in that
case

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
that being the case do you have any idea
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
what the financial impact of the passage
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
of this amendment would be for your
 
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.510 align:start position:0%
of this amendment would be for your
office

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh no not at the moment in fact we don't
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
know what the financial impact of the
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
passage of
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
s1 is going to be either and and and
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
that will be that would have been that
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
would have been my next question thank
 
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.630 align:start position:0%
would have been my next question thank
you

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair um mr
 
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair um mr
deputy

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
deputy
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
um i i understand you know that much of
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
your testimony focused on
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislation in the united states
 
00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.190 align:start position:0%
legislation in the united states
legislature

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
um and i wonder if is your understanding
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
that this amendment
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
converts the new hampshire senate bill
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
89 into a referendum
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
on uh on the the senate bill one in the
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
national legislature
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
i think this amendment uh
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
fires a shot across the bow to congress
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
about the wisdom of passing such such
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
a such legislation that would be a
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
federal takeover of our election
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
let me just elaborate on that a little
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
more because if
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
this if s1 passes congress now controls
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
the election laws for the state of new
 
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.990 align:start position:0%
the election laws for the state of new
hampshire

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
all of these items that we've been
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
debating for over the years
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
at a local level determining whether it
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
makes sense or not
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
for our voters are now going to be would
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
now be determined by congress
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the makeup of
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
congress there's over 400 members
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
in the house of representatives new
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire has two of them
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
so who's really going to be writing the
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
election laws if this federal takeover
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
takes place it's going to be states like
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
california new york texas
 
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
all of those states that have large
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
numbers of
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
of members of congress new hampshire is
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
going to struggle
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
in that environment and and i don't
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
think that's healthy or fair
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
to the citizens of our state follow-up
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
please mr chair
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
all right so my understanding from that
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
answer is that yes this this amendment
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
converts this
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
bill into a referendum i.e a shot across
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
the bow
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh national legislation
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
is there concern in the secretary of
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
state's office in the state of new
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire that
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
the office's stand on national
 
00:39:37.119 --> 00:39:38.790 align:start position:0%
the office's stand on national
legislation

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
will compromise the nonpartisan standing
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
and integrity
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire secretary of
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
the the the the climate you know in
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
in politics now is that that there are
 
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.230 align:start position:0%
in politics now is that that there are
polar

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
polar
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of polarization and
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
it is difficult
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh for an office like secretary of state
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
no matter what
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about to administer the
 
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.230 align:start position:0%
we're talking about to administer the
elections

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
and take positions on bad pieces of
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
legislation when
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
we see it and not be accused of being
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
partisan one way or the other
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
but but if we don't speak up we're not
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
doing our job we're not
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
we're not uh you know alerting uh
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
our citizens to uh what is going on
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned at the very beginning
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
and i i've repeated this you know that
 
00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:30.630 align:start position:0%
and i i've repeated this you know that
position

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
for years uh when i've given testimony
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
there is a delicate balance that we have
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
to find
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
between making voting easy and making
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
sure that it's secure enough that
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
people have confidence that their votes
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
are are being counted and not being
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
deluded or
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
other fraudulent activity taking place
 
00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.270 align:start position:0%
other fraudulent activity taking place
and

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
that is the perspective that we are
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
approaching this issue from it is not a
 
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.150 align:start position:0%
approaching this issue from it is not a
partisan

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh position it is uh one of
 
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.550 align:start position:0%
uh uh position it is uh one of
administration

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative o'brien thank
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%

us
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
my question is about
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
the um the reaction
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
of this legislation from
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
local town clerks and supervisors of the
 
00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:26.790 align:start position:0%
local town clerks and supervisors of the
checklist

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
and town moderators who run our
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
elections in new hampshire and when i
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
think of any bill i think of them first
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
and i think of how
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
feasible and reasonable anything is to
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
implement here on the ground
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
in real life in new hampshire and
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
i recently read an article where they uh
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
they questioned 24 town clerks and 21 of
 
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.390 align:start position:0%
they questioned 24 town clerks and 21 of
them

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
opposed the for the people act
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
and they would have approved of this
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
amendment then and i would i would like
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
to know what you think
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
when you had a recent uh meeting with
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
local town clerks throughout the state
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
and those clerks are you talking about
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
the polarization
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
and partisanship of this those clerks
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
and those officials they
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
they come from all political spectrums
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
they're all they're on the left they're
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
on the right the republicans the
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
democrats they're independents they're
 
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.829 align:start position:0%
democrats they're independents they're
everywhere

00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
how is the reaction from those people on
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
the ground running elections in new
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire on this uh
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
bill on the for the people act and on
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
this event
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question uh we
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
work very closely with
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh local election officials generally
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh but very closely with the clerks
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
um we discussed legislation
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh that is taking place with them and we
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
did give a briefing
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
on hr1 a couple of weeks ago
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
just to inform them of the contents of
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
so that they had an understanding of
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
what was being proposed
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
we did not uh after that event take
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
place paul the clerks
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh in any way um you know i would think
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
share the same concerns that we have
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
because you know we are in the
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the business of administrating

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
to reach out
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%

opinion is of this federal legislation
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you our representative lane
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um debbie scanlon
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
first the powerpoint that you referred
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
i have not seen it nor was i aware of it
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
so if it could be shared with all
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate it um
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
you also asked in your testimony when
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
you read out the things on page 20 of
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
if anyone would just say that that
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
voting any of those problems existed in
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
even the legislation on sb3 where it
 
00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:21.109 align:start position:0%
even the legislation on sb3 where it
requires

00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
multiple phd degrees to understand the
 
00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.150 align:start position:0%
multiple phd degrees to understand the
affidavit

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
i would say we have at least one of
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
those problems that you read out
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that i
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think i would disagree with you on
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
um and to answer the first part of your
 
00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:41.839 align:start position:0%
question i'll be happy to make sure that
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
the committee gets a copy of the
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
powerpoint okay
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
and uh follow up one more question
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
please mr chair
 
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um if i heard you correctly
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
deputy scalin i think you referenced
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you talked about
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
keeping our vote pure
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
language is important and perhaps
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
because i grew up in the deep south
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
that smacks of jim crow i'm sorry i
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
represented i don't mean to interrupt
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
you but
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
your screen froze up on me for like four
 
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.829 align:start position:0%
your screen froze up on me for like four
seconds

00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
you if i heard you correctly you
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
used the term keeping our vote pure
 
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
and and i i just wanted to say that
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
as someone who grew up in the deep south
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
snacks of jim crow
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
talk and i think we need to be careful
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
as you indicated
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is a highly charged issue and i
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make you aware
 
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
that that may touch off that type of
 
00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.870 align:start position:0%
that that may touch off that type of
language

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
it certainly had a knee-jerk reaction
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's true for everyone
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
on the committee but
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
um i think we need to remember
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
i yeah i i don't recall using words
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
keeping a vote pure
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
i just don't recall saying that exactly
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
that way okay
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
all right well maybe i misheard so thank
 
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.470 align:start position:0%
all right well maybe i misheard so thank
you

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr vice chair uh deputy
 
00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr vice chair uh deputy
scanlon

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
scanlon
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
in looking at the proposed amendment
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
could you tell me what provisions in
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
would give you or any other election
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
official the authority
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
to conduct parallel elections for
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
federal offices
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
and that for state and county offices
 
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.190 align:start position:0%
and that for state and county offices
including

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
adapting changing or making
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
any other types of edits to voter
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
registration setting up the polling
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
place checklist procedures
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
counting the ballots and so on
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh i can't point to anything in the
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
amendment however if sr
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
if s1 were to pass we would be doing a
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
major rewrite
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
of all of our election laws further
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
so then if senate bill one does pass
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
and that both agrees is pure speculation
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh major legislation is going to have to
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
be introduced anyway to
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that new hampshire's
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
laws conform with
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
or in or can work with the federal law
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay no further questions thank you
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative barry thank you
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
deputy assistant
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
can you hear me all right i'm a little
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
far away from the microphone uh if you
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
could just speak up
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
you're slightly muted i've never been
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
accused of that not talking about that
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
of course i'll take that as a compliment
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
um has any member of our federal
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
delegation spoken
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
with you or your office directly about
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
s1 or hr1
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
nothing i'm aware of why do you think
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
that is this is
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
as you say a major takeover of our
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
elections why do you think our federal
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
delegation all four members congressman
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
tapas senator hassan senator shaheen
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
and carmen from lincoln custer could not
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
be bothered to reach out to
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
the office that runs our elections in
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
the many
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
aspects of voting laws and sorts of
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
controversies the whole issue of
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
residency because we have a large number
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
and uh actually one of the things with
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
the student voting and won't go to it
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
much of that is that we always assume
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
that if you lived out of state before
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
you came
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire to attend college that
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
you could go to absentee or old state
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
and that's not necessarily the case
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
depending on what the uh law in the
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
other state is and certainly it's good
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
to have a certain amount of uh
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
uniformity in election law just for that
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
reason and many others um
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is first of all this has like
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
11 lines
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
of text and i really
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
i think we've we would have a hard press
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
we'd have a hard time
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
figuring out what exactly it means you
 
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.109 align:start position:0%
figuring out what exactly it means you
know

00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
representing benjamin griffin did give
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
an explanation of what
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
she your intent was but i'm not sure if
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's what that 11 lines of text
 
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.109 align:start position:0%
that's what that 11 lines of text
actually

00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
says um certainly it's massively
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
premature understand so far as
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
s1 and hr1 have not passed yet yet we
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what form
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
exactly what form they're going to take
 
00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:04.069 align:start position:0%
exactly what form they're going to take
um

00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
the uh and so you know so like we
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
probably certainly um
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
governor scanlon is i probably disagree
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
with his opinion about
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
this particular amendment but he studied
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
in great detail certainly you should uh
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
consult with him you could probably have
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee where he could speak for
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
more than three minutes plus the
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
question time and uh
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
certainly this summer and this fall
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
whenever the bill passed we'll
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
have to examine it and see what changes
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
we need to make to our existing laws
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
but i um i think this is way too soon to
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
pass something like that and certainly
 
00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.549 align:start position:0%
pass something like that and certainly
having

00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh two different elections system for
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
federal state
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
offices that's uh that's a so my opinion
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
it sounds like a totally absurd idea
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
um especially given that we rely a lot
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
of federal funding for our state
 
00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:52.069 align:start position:0%
of federal funding for our state
elections

00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
and just in the past uh
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
the past you know the past the federal
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
government has
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
felt and rightly so that local elections
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
are not entirely
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
beyond its purview so you know we uh
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
you know we we spend a lot of uh federal
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
money in fact we're putting the budget
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
together we spend as much federal money
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
as possible um we make lots of decisions
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
that affect federal
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh federal things but also
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
i also like i also just like to defend
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
the congressional delegation all of whom
 
00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:23.430 align:start position:0%
the congressional delegation all of whom
are

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
friends of mine are saying they don't
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
care i don't know whether or not they've
 
00:52:26.559 --> 00:52:26.950 align:start position:0%
care i don't know whether or not they've
called

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
secretary gardner deputy secretary
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
scanlon i'm sure
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sure if they picked up the phone and
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
called uh any of the senators or the
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
congress person's office they would
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
probably be happy
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
having to talk to them and i'm sure they
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
probably sounds like they have talked to
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
them so that's uh
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's just sort of an unfair
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
characterization certainly one of the
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
things we do
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
here at the state level is redistricting
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
in that effect thank you representative
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
your time is up any questions
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative oregon
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oregon for your
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
testimony oh thank you so anyway don't
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
pass the same adventures
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
the bill's great but this amendment just
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't add anything to it
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you very much also signed
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
i do not see marjorie if she would raise
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
her hand
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful but she does not
 
00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.510 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful but she does not
appear

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
appear
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
to be on the list i don't see her either
 
00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:18.630 align:start position:0%
to be on the list i don't see her either
okay

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i also signed up to speak
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
and and i apologize i'll probably
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
mispronounce this name
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
my name is kelsey clementowicz i live in
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and i'm a civil rights lawyer
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
focusing on voting issues
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'm testifying today as a member of the
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
public but informed by my experience
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
working with local elections officials
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
and hearing from thousands of new
 
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
hb 89 is a thoughtful and necessary bill
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
to assist
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
our hard-working new hampshire elections
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
officials and voters
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
but this amendment would do the opposite
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
the supremacy clause of the u.s
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
constitution establishes that the
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
federal constitution and federal law
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
generally take precedence over state
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
laws and even state constitutions
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so because new hampshire law cannot
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
preempt federal law
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
for federal offices elections
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment will only create two
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
separate schemes
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
and separate procedures for federal
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
offices and local
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
offices even on one election day so this
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
would more than double the work
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
of local elections officials during
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
federal election cycles
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
you can imagine federal officials must
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
offer voters one set of ballots
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
forms and rules for federal offices and
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
a separate set for local offices
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
they must also somehow manage and
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
maintain two different voter
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
registration apps and t-ballot lists
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
all for one election you can imagine how
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
confusing this would be for voters how
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
it would slow down lines on election
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
days and inundate clerks offices
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
so let's assume assume for a moment that
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
hr one passes
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
and includes online voter registration
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
and the sos
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
implements a comprehensive voter portal
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
system like they have in other states
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
where a voter can register change their
 
00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.230 align:start position:0%
where a voter can register change their
address

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
or request an absentee ballot online but
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
say a voter registers online and request
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
their absentee ballot
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
then they can only get a ballot for
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
federal offices under this amendment
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
so then they're calling their clerk
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
realizing they have to do additional
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
forms trying to get a ballot
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
but then that voter also needs to go on
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
election day to vote for local offices
 
00:55:28.549 --> 00:55:28.559 align:start position:0%
then are they just given a ballot for
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
local offices
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
which would necessitate probably a
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
separate machine
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
in order to process that or are
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
moderators required to cancel their
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots which means they can't
 
00:55:38.799 --> 00:55:39.030 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots which means they can't
be

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
fed into the machines until after the
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
close of polls
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
so these practical reasons are some of
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
the reasons why
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
attempts to create a two-tier election
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
system have failed or been struck down
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
across the united states
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
no state currently has this kind of a
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
two-tiered system
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
but the texas legislature actually just
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
heard a similar bill just last week that
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
was hb
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
4507 which would force voters to set to
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
register separately for federal and
 
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
state elections
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
also in response to hr1 but this bill
 
00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:11.190 align:start position:0%
also in response to hr1 but this bill
failed

00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
failed
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
even in the republican-controlled house
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
because of those costs and
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
administrative challenges also
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
kansas and arizona had bifurcated
 
00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.430 align:start position:0%
kansas and arizona had bifurcated
schemes

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
schemes
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
both of which well the first of which
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
was struck down by the courts
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
and arizona did a settlement to unify
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
their system
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
in lieu of the court judgment so this
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
amended bill if passed
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
would probably be unlikely to survive a
 
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
legal challenge and would tie the state
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
up in costly and unnecessary litigation
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
finally this bill attempts to address a
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
problem that just doesn't exist
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
any questions are you taking questions
 
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.910 align:start position:0%

resident of dover i'm testifying to put
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
the debate that hr1 has provoked
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
into a historical context in 1903 new
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire amended its constitution to
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
require that voters be able to
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
quote read the english language and to
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
write unquote
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
in 1905 a law was passed to put in place
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
a literacy test to be applied when a
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
person went to register to vote clips of
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
paper were placed in a box
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
with each slip containing five lines of
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
the state constitution
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
a person applying to vote would reach
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
into the box to select a slip
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
and then needed to read all five lines
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
copy by hand one of the lines and then
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
sign their name
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the motivation was for
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
the literacy test
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps there was a concern about the
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
growth of the number of non-english
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
speaking immigrants at the time
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
but it seems clear that the law was
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
intended to suppress the votes that were
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
perceived as low quality
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
the lyricist the literacy test stayed on
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
the books
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
believe it or not until 1976 what was
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
the motivation to finally remove it
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
well it was the landmark 1965 voting
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
rights act
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
which aimed to eliminate the voting
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
apartheid that existed in many southern
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
states at the time
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
southerners and many state rights
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
advocates were upset about what they saw
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
as federal overreach
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
however both senators from new hampshire
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
voted for the bill
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
one republican and one democrat
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire got caught in the war for
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
full citizenship of americans
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
for african americans because of the
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
literacy test
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
combination of having the literacy test
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
still on the books and 10 towns had poor
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
voter participation in the 1968 election
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
caused those 10 towns to be put to be
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
labeled as covered
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions requiring any changes to
 
01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.430 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions requiring any changes to
their

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
voting procedures to be pre-cleared by
 
01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:14.950 align:start position:0%
voting procedures to be pre-cleared by
the

01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.190 align:start position:0%
the
federal

01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
this cost so i do not know why new
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire decided to leave its literacy
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
tests on the books
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
even after the passing of the 1965
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
civil rights act i hope that we would
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
all agree today that finally removing
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
the literacy test was a good thing
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
and that the civil rights act was a very
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
good thing for our nation
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
more recently in 1993 the federal
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
government passed the national voter
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
registration act
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
better known as the motor voter bill
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
is what encouraged us to go to election
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
day registration
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
as chair griffin mentioned in recent
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
years we've had high
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
as measured by the secretary of state
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's in fact because of
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
this federal legislation that encourages
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
us to improve our voting
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
procedures so while it details hr1
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
surely should be debated
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
a blanket refusal to allow the federal
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
government to call for improvements to
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
our state voting practices has no

my name is ken barnes i live in catooka
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
and i speak against this
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendment as non-germane it is what is
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
known to all of you no doubt and
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
politicians as a poison pill it is
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
something that is not actually related
 
01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.470 align:start position:0%
something that is not actually related
to

01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
the um bill that it's attached to
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
and it has the completely opposite in
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
effect as the bill itself sb 89
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
would help to make voting easier more
 
01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.309 align:start position:0%
would help to make voting easier more
uniform

01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
uniform
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
more fair in new hampshire and this
 
01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:11.990 align:start position:0%
more fair in new hampshire and this
amendment

01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
would do the opposite it would make
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
voting more difficult and
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
and more costly the bill
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
would by creating two separate
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh voting systems as deputy scanlan said
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
the solution to different might not have
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
to be different days it could be
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
on different ballots and with different
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
checklists and with different
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
procedures so everything would be done
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
double by
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
the local election officials voters
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
would have to follow two different
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
processes for for
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
get registering and and voting depending
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
on whether the state of new hampshire's
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
rules for their ballots were different
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
from the federal government's rules
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
for its spouse and that would cost money
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire doesn't have the money
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
but the most important thing is that it
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of people who voted
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office the governor
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
all of us have
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
appraised the new hampshire voting
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
system in the last election and previous
 
01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.430 align:start position:0%
system in the last election and previous
elections

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
as being open fair encouraging people to
 
01:04:29.359 --> 01:04:30.309 align:start position:0%
as being open fair encouraging people to
vote

01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
and making it easier for people to vote
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i suggest similarly not during the
 
01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:37.990 align:start position:0%
and i suggest similarly not during the
pandemic

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
it should be easier for more people to
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
vote and
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's what democracy is all about and
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
this would just create massive confusion
 
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh extra work for the local election
 
01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:51.990 align:start position:0%
uh extra work for the local election
officials

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
officials
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
and extra costs extra cost thank you i'm
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
almost done extra
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
costs to the local uh property taxpayers
 
01:04:58.799 --> 01:05:00.150 align:start position:0%
costs to the local uh property taxpayers
who

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
god knows are already overburdened uh
 
01:05:02.559 --> 01:05:03.510 align:start position:0%
god knows are already overburdened uh
with

01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh paying costs so i
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
ask you to please vote no on the
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%

01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
johnston representing new hampshire
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
thank you um and i'm i'm not exactly
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
sure what to say about this
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
amendment my initial reaction when i
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
read it was
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh that it it's crazy it can't work
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
um to have two basically two separate
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
processes for
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
elections um for reasons that
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
that other people have have talked about
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
but i have to admit that i had not paid
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
as much attention to hr1 as i
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
should i spend pretty much all my time
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
following state legislation and doesn't
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
leave a lot of time for
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
what's going on at the federal level um
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
i i had assumed and i think
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
correctly that the debate on hr1
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
was uh characterized by extreme
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh partisan hyperbole on both sides
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
and uh so so i decided that i should
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
actually get a little more familiar with
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
it and
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
i have read it um not not in any detail
 
01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:46.069 align:start position:0%
i have read it um not not in any detail
but

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
have gone through it and and i realize
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
this isn't a hearing on hr1
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
but the there are in my opinion a lot of
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
good things in hr1
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
but there are also some things that are
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
would be impossible in new hampshire
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
um and the one thing i'll mention
 
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.789 align:start position:0%
um and the one thing i'll mention
specifically

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
is the early voting provisions uh
 
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%
the idea that every and under this bill
 
01:07:13.839 --> 01:07:15.109 align:start position:0%
the idea that every and under this bill
every

01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
voting uh location in new hampshire
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
would have to be open
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
10 hours a day for 15 days
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
before the election is simply insane uh
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm the moderator in my town
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
i do not have uh 10 hours a day
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
fit for 15 days in a row to spend
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
sitting at the polling place waiting for
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
one or two people
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
to come in and vote now something like
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
that may make sense in a place like
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
georgia or texas where you might have
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
half a million people
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
voting in one location but in
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
a town where you have you know 70 um
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
it it as i said it's insane
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
and and there's no there's no um
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
you don't have an option there's there's
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
no possibility for waiver
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
so i still don't think uh
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not at all convinced this amendment
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
is okay i'm not at all convinced this
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is the answer
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
i think we are in an impossible
 
01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.829 align:start position:0%
i think we are in an impossible
situation

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%

uh good morning uh mr chairman and
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
member of the committee my name is
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
lucas meyer i am the volunteer chair of
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
603 forward
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm an organization that works with
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
working age adults in new hampshire
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
um and one of our core pillars is making
 
01:09:45.199 --> 01:09:45.829 align:start position:0%
um and one of our core pillars is making
sure

01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh our state has a healthy democracy um
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
as we move forward
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
um we obviously have great concerns
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
about this amendment
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
um one uh especially considering the
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
fact it's been attached to sb 89
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
which is the result of great bipartisan
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
work in the senate
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
so to attach this rather partisan
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill to it in order to
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
either sync it or change its purpose i
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
think is rather insidious
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
and then to the nature of trying to
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
establish two separate forms of election
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
in response
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
to hr1 which would transform and
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
strengthen our democracy
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
is concerning i would also like to
 
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.149 align:start position:0%
is concerning i would also like to
highlight

01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
highlight
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
um following uh mr johnson's testimony
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
from the municipal association
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh there are write-ups happening to the
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
bill as we speak
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
including an exemption for communities
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
under 3 000 people
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
would not have that early vote provision
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh timelines have
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
been extended for implementation there
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
is clearly work
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
being done on this bill to make it work
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
for states like new hampshire
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
and it can work for new hampshire uh and
 
01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.070 align:start position:0%
and it can work for new hampshire uh and
i

01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
think this amendment i think this
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
hearing does a disservice
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
to voters of new hampshire a disservice
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
to our local election officials
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
um and i think given the rhetoric uh
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
put forth this morning i think the
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
intent is very clear
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh why this amendment was introduced and
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
i do
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
not think it is in the best interest of
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
our voters
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
of our elections and of our democracy uh
 
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
encourage this committee to really
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
consider if they want to pass this
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
especially not understanding what the
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
impact could be to our local election
 
01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:34.870 align:start position:0%
impact could be to our local election
officials

01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
officials
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
to our voters how much this would cost
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
it is clear there are not enough
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
answers to this amendment even remotely
 
01:11:44.719 --> 01:11:45.430 align:start position:0%
answers to this amendment even remotely
close

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh to move forward with it um our
 
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.630 align:start position:0%
uh to move forward with it um our
democracy

01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
is an urgent need pair i think
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
everybody on this call i think everybody
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
would agree that government doesn't
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
always work
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
for the people um the only power grab
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
i see right now is in the abundance of
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
billionaires of corporate special
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
interest in our elections
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
and hr one s-one the for the people act
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%

01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee i implore this committee
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%

congress
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
apparently violating the u.s
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
constitution and having a federal
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
takeover of
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the election process i would support
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
even if it meant we have to have
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
separate federal and state ballots
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
with potentially some voters not
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
qualifying to
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
get both ballots and i would also
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
support this amendment if required new
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire to have two separate election
 
01:14:14.239 --> 01:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
hampshire to have two separate election
days

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
for the two different ballots i think it
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
would also be important
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the new hampshire
 
01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.110 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the new hampshire
legislature

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%

on the way
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%

president of the league of women voters
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
and our mission is to empower voters
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning deputy scanlon said
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
election process
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
has to work for all voters
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
and i fear this amendment if
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
hr one passes and if this amendment
 
01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:30.950 align:start position:0%
hr one passes and if this amendment
passes

01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
passes
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
will do exactly the opposite rather than
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
empower voters it will frustrate voters
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
it will discourage voters it will make
 
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
voters lose
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
confidence in a system we have great
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
voter turnout in new hampshire
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
as as we're all well aware and we have
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
confidence in our elections the governor
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
and election officials have all reported
 
01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
and election officials have all reported
that

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
but if in the future
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
voters have to register one way for
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
federal elections
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
and register a different way for state
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
county and local elections they will
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
lose that confidence that the system
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
knows what it's doing that's not what we
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
want to have happen
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
we want voters to participate in our
 
01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.310 align:start position:0%
we want voters to participate in our
democracy

01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
now whether or not you like hr1
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
is up to each individual and i think
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
it's up to
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee to make
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
their views
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
known to our congressional delegation
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
but to try to legislate their viewpoint
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh seems like a reach of power just as
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
we are criticizing the federal
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
government possibly for a reach
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
and overreach here i think trying to
 
01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.750 align:start position:0%
and overreach here i think trying to
legislate

01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
this way is also an overreach
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
i support sb 89
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's a good bill with bipartisan support
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
i oppose this amendment
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
because of the effects it will have on
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
the public the voting public
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
and it will discourage them from voting
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
when things get too complicated
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
people will not vote new hampshire has
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
good election laws we have for instance
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
a voter id law that has alternatives for
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
those who come
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
without a driver's license that's good
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you we have some of those very
 
01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
good things that are in hr1
 
01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
i will leave the argument over hr1 up to
 
01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:49.510 align:start position:0%
i will leave the argument over hr1 up to
you

01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
but to legislate it here is not the way
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from this
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%

thank you mike and i thank you for
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
allowing me this time
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
i live in hanover where i have
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
volunteered at the polls on election day
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
for the last 30 years
 
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
until i recently retired i taught
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
american history and literature for
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
three decades in new hampshire's public
 
01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.830 align:start position:0%
three decades in new hampshire's public
schools

01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
one important goal was to educate my
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
students about what it means that the
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
united states is a democracy and to
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
celebrate the points in history
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
when additional groups were enfranchised
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
i taught my students to take the act of
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
voting seriously
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
and encouraged them to volunteer so they
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
would understand the importance of
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
political engagement
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
in addition as a child growing up during
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
the cold war i lived in baghdad
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
as well as in east and west africa where
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
my father worked to support democratic
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
principles and to encourage governments
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
to follow the model of the united states
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
rather than that of the then soviet
 
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:13.510 align:start position:0%
rather than that of the then soviet
union

01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
union
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
it is therefore with no small degree of
 
01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.630 align:start position:0%
it is therefore with no small degree of
dismay

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
dismay
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
that i respond to this amendment which
 
01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.070 align:start position:0%
that i respond to this amendment which
distorts

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
distorts
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
information contained in the federal
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill there's no other way of looking at
 
01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:25.110 align:start position:0%
bill there's no other way of looking at
it

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
and it does everything possible to
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
create barriers to voting
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
when in a true democracy the right of
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
people to exercise their vote
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
should be of greatest importance the for
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
the people act
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
is not a quote federal takeover and i
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
really wish we could stop
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
using such charged language to discuss
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
bills that come before us this amendment
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
raises the potential for incredible
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
confusion on the part of voters as
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
it expands the burden on town clerks
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
presents poll workers and supervisors of
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
the checklist with redundant tasks
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
and raises the cost for towns to hold
 
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.430 align:start position:0%
and raises the cost for towns to hold
elections

01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i would argue that the secretary of
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
state's presentation
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
two town clerks a few weeks ago
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
was distorted was riddled with
 
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.030 align:start position:0%
was distorted was riddled with
misinformation

01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
misinformation
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
and was highly not
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
independent in other words it was very
 
01:20:24.159 --> 01:20:25.990 align:start position:0%
independent in other words it was very
partisan

01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
there are many questions that have
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
already been raised by other groups
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
about two checklists two voting days i
 
01:20:31.679 --> 01:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
about two checklists two voting days i
won't

01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
won't
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
repeat all of them but the for the
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
people act bill which is before
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
the federal government which this
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
amendment seeks to undermine
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
contrary to what you've heard from
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
several people provides
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
all necessary funding it is not
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
going to ask the state to do something
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
and not three seconds remaining
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you it eases registration it gets
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
rid of the role dark money plays in our
 
01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.270 align:start position:0%
rid of the role dark money plays in our
politics

01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
politics
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
it has bipartisan support from the
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
american public
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
and it celebrates the democratic act of
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
voting this amendment
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
does none of that and i cannot imagine

good morning my name is elizabeth
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
carrell and
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
i live in concord uh i oppose this
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
amendment as um award supervisor of the
 
01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.350 align:start position:0%
amendment as um award supervisor of the
checklist

01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
so my comments are specifically in the
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
realm of the local
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
impact and i really have two points to
 
01:22:12.639 --> 01:22:13.830 align:start position:0%
impact and i really have two points to
share

01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
share
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
you know as a supervisor we come to our
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
jobs as volunteers
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
and we're usually picking up the
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
procedure manual that the secretary of
 
01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:24.310 align:start position:0%
procedure manual that the secretary of
state

01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
prepares one two maybe three times a
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
year depending on the number of
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
elections occurring
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
this is not something we do every day so
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
we're reviewing that procedure manual
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's a tough job in that that procedure
 
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
manual is now
 
01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
380 pages long
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
so the notion that we are now going to
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
have two checklists
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
two processes to follow
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
i i find mind-boggling and um
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
quite frustrating the other factor
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's occurring
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
at many polling places is it's getting
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
harder to find people to run for
 
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.990 align:start position:0%
harder to find people to run for
supervisor

01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
supervisor
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
moderator and some of these tasks so be
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
aware that we do this because we
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
care but the harder you make it the
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
harder it will be to find people like us
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
to carry out this job
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
my second point is you've heard it many
 
01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.229 align:start position:0%
my second point is you've heard it many
times

01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
confusion is used as a tool to keep
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
people away from the polls
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
there has been confusion built into the
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
process over the last 10 years with
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
every change that comes to the ballot
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
process someone asked earlier
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
do you know anyone who hasn't come well
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
think about that question
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been denied voting if
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
they haven't come to the door
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
how would i know that you know it's the
 
01:23:51.199 --> 01:23:52.390 align:start position:0%
how would i know that you know it's the
confusion

01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
that causes them to pause and say well i
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
guess maybe i can't vote so
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
i hope it's clear that i oppose this
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
amendment i
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
highly support efforts to enable people
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
honestly and through a trustworthy
 
01:24:06.719 --> 01:24:07.910 align:start position:0%
honestly and through a trustworthy
process

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
i do not believe this amendment has that
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
goal in mind

that set a floor their common sense
 
01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:56.950 align:start position:0%
that set a floor their common sense
standards

01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
like automatic voter registration online
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
voter registration
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
same-day voter registration it has been
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
that this impacts um photo id
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
requirements i urge you to read the bill
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
and not listen to the dark money
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
advertisements in new hampshire
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
this bill just says if you don't have a
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
photo id you have to sign an affidavit
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
which is what new hampshire does we take
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
their picture
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
people sign an affidavit so please read
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
and not listen to the dark money
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
advertisements this bill also
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
ends partisan gerrymandering by creating
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
an independent redistricting commission
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
i think we all can agree that voters
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
should be picking our representatives
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
and not our politicians picking
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
i'm getting big money out of politics
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
and combating corruption
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
it's very important that we do this this
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
amendment simply put
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
creates massive confusion and costs new
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire a lot of money
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
federal law cannot be nullified um
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
federal the federal government will run
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
federal elections
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
and creating a two-track system is
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
inappropriate therefore i
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote down this amendment and
 
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:07.120 align:start position:0%

i am speaking in opposition to the
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment 1445 to house bill
 
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment 1445 to house bill
89

01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
89
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
i worry there's been no financial note
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh for what exactly it may cost to run
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
two parallel election systems
 
01:30:49.590 --> 01:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
who would then be responsible for
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
picking up the increased cost
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
and is this something else that will be
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
passed down to towns and cities to pay
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
additionally i have personal experience
 
01:30:58.239 --> 01:30:59.270 align:start position:0%
additionally i have personal experience
working

01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
in my town's elections a poll worker of
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
how very great the time commitment is
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
for our election officials before
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
election day during the very long day at
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
the polls
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
and then many steps to process records
 
01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:11.910 align:start position:0%
and then many steps to process records
afterwards

01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
where will an extra workforce be found
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
to run two sets of elections and
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
in the case of paid workers how will
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
that be paid for
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
additionally it takes about 100
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers to fully staff our polls
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
is it likely that 100 volunteers will be
 
01:31:28.639 --> 01:31:29.350 align:start position:0%
is it likely that 100 volunteers will be
fined

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
fined
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
will be found if there is going to be a
 
01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:32.709 align:start position:0%
will be found if there is going to be a
second

01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
day of parallel elections if not then
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned before there's the
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
expense of a second
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
set of voting machines so either way
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
the resources either human or financial
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
will be considerable and there are so
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
many of these details that need to be
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
considered before a bill of this size
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
is allowed to move forward as it stands
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
now this bill
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
purpose seems to create an electric
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
an election process that is chaotic
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
which will then of course discourage
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
people from
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
voting at all so thank you for uh
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%

01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%

i'm speaking in
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to this amendment uh
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
for the many of the reasons that have
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
been talked about
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%

01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
things i really object
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%

01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
official attitudes toward s1
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%

um in the media have been
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
they're speculative there's been no
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
reliable polling done
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%

conducted one way the new hampshire
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
constitution and new hampshire law will
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
apply to non-federal elections
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
to ballots to procedures and
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%

counting of votes
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
this will be confusing for voters and
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
serve as a barrier to voting for many
 
01:36:40.159 --> 01:36:41.350 align:start position:0%
serve as a barrier to voting for many
people

people
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
it will create additional work for
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
official election officials
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
establishing two separate systems will
 
01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:48.870 align:start position:0%

incur

01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
incur
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
significant expenses the for the people
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%

by new hampshire voters i am confident
 
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.320 align:start position:0%

01:38:10.159 --> 01:38:11.510 align:start position:0%
i suggested to mr scanlon that he
contact

01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%

told uh mr scanlon that his
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
not his slideshow but his commentary on
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
the act
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
was as disingenuous and willfully
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
um blind to the critical objectives
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
of the for the people act as is this
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
non-germane amendment
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
to a good bill sb 89 which you are
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%

senate committee on the judiciary's
 
01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:47.109 align:start position:0%
senate committee on the judiciary's
hearing

01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
on the for the people act during which
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's secretary of state
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
also demonstrated what had to be willful
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
blindness regarding
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
the critical necessity of this
 
01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.109 align:start position:0%
the critical necessity of this
legislation

01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
surely he and mr scanlon have witnessed
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
the multitude of voter suppression laws
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
being considered nationwide and must
 
01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:08.070 align:start position:0%
being considered nationwide and must
appreciate

01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
the need for the for the people act let
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
us be clear
 
01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
before the people act was not designed
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
to disrespect states like new hampshire
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
which did an
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
admirable job of conducting safe and
 
01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
fair elections
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
even during the pandemic as for the
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
letter sent to senator maggie hassan
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
by representatives ross berry and joe
 
01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.430 align:start position:0%
by representatives ross berry and joe
sweeney

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
sweeney
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
like the testimony of mr gardner in the
 
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
presentation by mr scanlon
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
it contains a deliberate failure to
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledge and document
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
critical voter suppression issues the
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
act was designed to address
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
as well as considerable misinformation
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
here are some of the key objectives of
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
to ensure that billionaires and
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
corporate special interests cannot buy
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
our elections to directly address
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
corrupt practices which deny
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
legitimate voters their right to vote to
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
end the corrupt practice of
 
01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.109 align:start position:0%
end the corrupt practice of
gerrymandering

01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee are
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
charged with protecting the keystone of
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
our democracy
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
our right to vote there is no defensible
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
reason to support this non-germane
 
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:14.870 align:start position:0%
reason to support this non-germane
amendment

01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
which would require totally unnecessary
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
financially costly and utterly confusing
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
separate sets of elections in general
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
elections this amendment would block
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
provisions that would protect
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
and enhance the rights of legitimate

01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to amendment 1445 h
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
s 1 is a federal bill that sets minimum
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
standards for conducting of elections
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is vehemently opposed by big

social media ads opposing s1
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
that i have encountered i conclude they
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
all take full advantage of the doctrine
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
of lying as protected speech
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
the effect of this amendment is to
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%

on overturning an election
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%

released a symbolic cease and desist
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
order to followers of the big lie
 
01:43:23.590 --> 01:43:23.600 align:start position:0%

a number of proposed amendments
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
and i am open to any amendments which
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
have not
 
01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
yet been distributed if anybody has them
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
i am not aware
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
of any representative lane i see you
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
have your hand open
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
his hand up it's open too
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
i just was wondering since this is a
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
separate hearing do we have to go
 
01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:38.310 align:start position:0%
separate hearing do we have to go
through

01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
we're present we're by ourselves all
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's do we need to go through those
 
01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:42.629 align:start position:0%
that's do we need to go through those
protocols

01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
i just don't want all this work to go
 
01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:45.679 align:start position:0%
for naught and have somebody come back
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
later and say we didn't do it i'm hoping
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
pam is back in her office
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think so pam do we need to do
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
another roll call for attendance
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
and do the whole opening again um
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
we have when we've changed the type of
 
01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.830 align:start position:0%
we have when we've changed the type of
meeting

01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know a hard and fast you know
 
01:59:08.229 --> 01:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
requirement for it
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
but might the other committees i've
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
worked with have just to be
 
01:59:14.709 --> 01:59:14.719 align:start position:0%

02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
whether it is individualized advice or
 
02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:30.159 align:start position:0%
general advice to the public
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
to avoid being in places like a polling
 
02:06:32.639 --> 02:06:33.990 align:start position:0%
to avoid being in places like a polling
place

02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
so my question is i i have family
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
members one of who
 
02:06:40.149 --> 02:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
had an organ transplant another who was
 
02:06:42.069 --> 02:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
in stage four cancer and
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
are under the advice of their doctors to
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
avoid large gatherings of people
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
is it your intent to deny those people
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
the right to request an absentee ballot
 
02:06:56.830 --> 02:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
so that they can avoid going to public
 
02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:58.550 align:start position:0%
so that they can avoid going to public
places

02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
places
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
that is not my intent at all but
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
the action as it currently exists
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
under the emergency boards
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
unrelated to the
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
standard process that we are
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
talking about here if there's a
 
02:07:18.639 --> 02:07:20.229 align:start position:0%
talking about here if there's a
requirement

02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
that a mass
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
an emergency order such as we are
 
02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:28.149 align:start position:0%
an emergency order such as we are
currently

02:07:28.149 --> 02:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
experiencing and that is a separate
 
02:07:35.589 --> 02:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
item of one-off
 
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
sort of circumstance rather than the
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
further question madam chair
 
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative representative hayward
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the original bill or
 
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
your amendment that says anything to do
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
with masks it just talks about
 
02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
medical conditions and in the case of
 
02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's uh
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
memo it talks about a person should have
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
the right
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
to request a ballot if they receive
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
individual advice or general advice
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
related to their medical condition to
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
avoid going to
 
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
public areas like like a polling place
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
in other words this is not covid
 
02:08:21.430 --> 02:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
specific it is not
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
an emergency order specific it deals
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
with any
 
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
example or situation where someone might
 
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
have a medical condition that
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
should enable them to obtain an absentee
 
02:08:31.599 --> 02:08:34.629 align:start position:0%
should enable them to obtain an absentee
ballot

02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.550 --> 02:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
and may i just interject that that
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
representative hayward
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's your voice is relatively soft
 
02:08:41.910 --> 02:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
and and if you could be
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
near a microphone it would be helpful
 
02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm now very near on microphone
 
02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:48.790 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm now very near on microphone
oh

02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
we're uh i
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh i did not talk about masks at all so
 
02:08:57.750 --> 02:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
i i hope that wasn't
 
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh a part of
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
what what you heard
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
i think just for clarification there is
 
02:09:08.159 --> 02:09:08.950 align:start position:0%
i think just for clarification there is
the

02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
the law of pre-statute there is the
 
02:09:12.229 --> 02:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
emergency order
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
and then there is a separate
 
02:09:15.510 --> 02:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron i believe you're
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
referring to a separate memorandum that
 
02:09:18.719 --> 02:09:19.030 align:start position:0%
referring to a separate memorandum that
was

02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
issued in regards to the status of
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
elections that
 
02:09:23.910 --> 02:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
was not specifically part of the
 
02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:25.669 align:start position:0%
was not specifically part of the
emergencies

02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
correct i'm referring to a memo dated
 
02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
april 10 2020 relative to elections
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
operations during
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency correct and i i
 
02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:35.589 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency correct and i i
understand

02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
representative hayward's going to be it
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
was operative during his state of
 
02:09:39.119 --> 02:09:40.629 align:start position:0%
was operative during his state of
emergency

02:09:40.629 --> 02:09:40.639 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
many committee members and i i will say
 
02:09:51.679 --> 02:09:52.149 align:start position:0%
many committee members and i i will say
that

02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
during the break i pondered that it is
 
02:09:54.239 --> 02:09:56.149 align:start position:0%
during the break i pondered that it is
actually

02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
much more interesting to sit on the side
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
in these
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
in these meetings to sit in the front of
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
the room managing it so
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
there you go i had my morning off
 
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair i i could
 
02:10:11.189 --> 02:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
hardly hear
 
02:10:14.149 --> 02:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
what representative hayward said so if
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
he could just
 
02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
keep his answer to representative
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
bergeron's because i'm still not clear
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
on why the sentence needed to be deleted
 
02:10:26.709 --> 02:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
i also had great difficulty hearing his
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
i would say rather than try and
 
02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:37.030 align:start position:0%
i would say rather than try and
re-answer

02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
re-answer
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
if i return back to the beginning
 
02:10:45.510 --> 02:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
because representative bergeron's
 
02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:46.069 align:start position:0%
because representative bergeron's
question

02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:10:49.109 --> 02:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
really related to a different document
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
than we are
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
working on that
 
02:10:58.030 --> 02:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
my amendment to
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
sb-31 is part which will become part of
 
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
the rsa
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh eliminates a pandemic only sentence
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is out of place in this disability
 
02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:11.270 align:start position:0%
that is out of place in this disability
question

02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:11:14.709 --> 02:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
and it's worded so vaguely that it is
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary as an exception in
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
the normal or standard context
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
um i guess i don't see anything about
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
in the original language it just talks
 
02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:47.270 align:start position:0%
in the original language it just talks
about

02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
a medical condition that poses a risk of
 
02:11:49.599 --> 02:11:50.870 align:start position:0%
a medical condition that poses a risk of
infection

02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
infection
 
02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
so it it's not necessarily related to
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
covert or pandemic it just says that
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
in the example he gave if someone's in
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
stage four cancer
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
and they've been told by their doctor
 
02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
not to vote
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
not to go into public places to vote
 
02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:07.589 align:start position:0%
not to go into public places to vote
under

02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
without that language i'm not sure that
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
they qualify
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
as a disability that's that's why
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
i i like the language is because it made
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
it clear
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
it wasn't related at all thank you
 
02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:23.350 align:start position:0%
it wasn't related at all thank you
representative

02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
i think the difference in position is
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
noted um i do not recall
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
hearing any testimony and i did not do
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
the senate testimony of the public
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on this
 
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
for anybody who had such a condition
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
which should have been
 
02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
pretty pandemic certainly and as to
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron's
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
example that uh felt that the law
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
required them to vote
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
in place and that they wouldn't qualify
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
under the language of disability
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
as it existed prior to the pandemic
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
i i certainly have some concerns about
 
02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
it because
 
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
of the generic
 
02:13:03.589 --> 02:13:03.599 align:start position:0%
nature of it in regards to you know
 
02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
polling places in the winter and the
 
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
same risk class for covid certainly is
 
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
the same risk path for something such as
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
the flu
 
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
and no i don't want to get into whether
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
you should be in or out with the flu
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
but i think that for me
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
that was something certain i didn't have
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
any issues with the fact that i felt
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
that somebody in representative bergeron
 
02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:26.149 align:start position:0%
that somebody in representative bergeron
situation

02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
would qualify as being disabled and
 
02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
certainly would have been
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
under a condition where they were not
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
able to leave their house for health
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
reasons under any circumstances
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
given that the risk of infection was so
 
02:13:38.639 --> 02:13:39.430 align:start position:0%
given that the risk of infection was so
strong

02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
strong
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
having some familiarity with people in
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
the treatment
 
02:13:44.069 --> 02:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments from
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
committee members representative cody
 
02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chad i guess i'm i'm
 
02:13:49.589 --> 02:13:49.599 align:start position:0%
still trying to figure out what
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
what representative hayward's intent is
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the proposed
 
02:14:08.159 --> 02:14:11.430 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the proposed
amendment

02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
um also committee members just for a
 
02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:14.709 align:start position:0%
um also committee members just for a
process

02:14:14.709 --> 02:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:14:17.350 --> 02:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
if bills are amended today they will go
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
to a committee of
 
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
conference um i think
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
if after if they are passed by the house
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
at session
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
on june 3rd or 4th i think we're meeting
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
our fourth or fifth i can't remember
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
amended bills that pass the house will
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
go to a committee of conference
 
02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
i believe the committee conference is
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
the following
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
week i believe those committee
 
02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
conferences are intended to be hybrid
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
and for purposes of amendment on what we
 
02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
would refer to as our senate omnibus
 
02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:51.589 align:start position:0%
would refer to as our senate omnibus
bills

02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
if a section of a bill is
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
removed or amended either in any bill
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
or as an on the bus bill that will not
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
go to the floor to be voted on which
 
02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:04.950 align:start position:0%
go to the floor to be voted on which
means

02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
it can be brought forward again
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the second year of this session
 
02:15:15.189 --> 02:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
so that's just a little procedural note
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
in regards to changes that could
 
02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
get made to bills this year the first
 
02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:20.390 align:start position:0%
get made to bills this year the first
year

02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
of the session excuse me madam chair but
 
02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:23.830 align:start position:0%
of the session excuse me madam chair but
isn't

02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
we don't know anything about whether the
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
senate will concur with
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
with any of these amendments do we i
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
mean yeah
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference would only
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
occur if the senate requested one and
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
the house
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
acceded to one so we
 
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
really don't know that at this point do
 
02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:41.189 align:start position:0%
really don't know that at this point do
we

02:15:41.189 --> 02:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cody i really i
 
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't i don't certainly know the senate
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
position on any of these
 
02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%

you know i believe that representative
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
friedas was recorded
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
as a yes vote on the amendment but not
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
but not
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
on the overall vote i'm not sure she
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
intended to do that because i recall
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
hearing her
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
say oh no at one point um
 
02:20:14.469 --> 02:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
is anybody have any other clarification
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that all republicans
 
02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
and one democrat voted for the bill as
 
02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:21.830 align:start position:0%
and one democrat voted for the bill as
amended

02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
amended
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
two democrats representative a

representative barry uh yes ma'am
chairman

02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
very briefly i'm a big fan of electronic
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
poll books i'm a big fan
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
of modernizing our elections i believe
 
02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
that electronic poll books
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
in the long run will create shorter
 
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
lines on election day because as
 
02:22:44.630 --> 02:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
most large uh voting places we go in
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
names are segregated
 
02:22:53.910 --> 02:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
and that creates a problem on election
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
day because very often
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
um there's nobody in the a to b line of
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
people who are in through you know
 
02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:03.510 align:start position:0%
people who are in through you know
whatever

02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
s have a line backed up electronic pull
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
books that problem is gone
 
02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
now it's just a matter of how many how
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
many workers do we have there they can
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
process any one regardless of their last
 
02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:14.150 align:start position:0%
process any one regardless of their last
name

02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
name
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
so it'll decrease waiting times on
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
election day
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%

yes thank you madam chair i was
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned to bill i like that
 
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
still some things need to be sorted out
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
since the reason to retain the bills to
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
work on it
 
02:26:00.710 --> 02:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
um have to do with identification
 
02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
and uh on the last page of the bill
 
02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:16.790 align:start position:0%
and uh on the last page of the bill
under

02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:20.469 --> 02:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
or talks about
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
one of them is um any other information
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
or records that the town clerk may
 
02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:25.030 align:start position:0%
or records that the town clerk may
verify

02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
verify
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
so some of this needs to be kind of
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
defined and i'm confident
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh retaining the bill we can work this
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
out uh
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
to bring something back that's uh more
 
02:26:34.479 --> 02:26:36.630 align:start position:0%
to bring something back that's uh more
specific

02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's all i have is there further
 
02:26:42.309 --> 02:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
discussion on this motion which is to
 
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
retain i would
 
02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
also just point out that this committee
 
02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
has retained
 
02:26:51.630 --> 02:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
i think a parallel or similar bill hb
 
02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:54.469 align:start position:0%
i think a parallel or similar bill hb
144

02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
144
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative cody
 
02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat along the lines of the previous
 
02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:00.710 align:start position:0%
somewhat along the lines of the previous
speaker

02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
i have some problems with some of this
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
but it's certainly
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
i certainly agree that it is a good
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
candidate for retention it has some
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
serious problems over and above those
 
02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:11.349 align:start position:0%
serious problems over and above those
that

02:27:11.349 --> 02:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
that i'm referring to so i will be
 
02:27:14.790 --> 02:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
voting to retain the bill
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for any further
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%

sv 83 had a public hearing on april

23rd this is
 
02:28:44.469 --> 02:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
our first consideration of an omnibus
 
02:28:44.479 --> 02:28:44.870 align:start position:0%
our first consideration of an omnibus

bill
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
from the senate it has five parts as we
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
did so during the public hearing
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to proceed through these
 
02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
anonymous bills by part
 
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
taking motions by part looking for
 
02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
a motion at the end of the
 
02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
considerations of the individual parts
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
for the motion as a whole
 
02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
so part one of sb
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
83 deals with the qualification of
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
certain persons from performing duties
 
02:29:17.830 --> 02:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
as an election official
 
02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment that has been sent
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
it is amendment number 2021
 
02:29:33.429 --> 02:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald moves in 1481
 
02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
each is there a second i second that
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative rowan seconds it
 
02:29:45.910 --> 02:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald would you like
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
while we understand some of the concerns
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
about potential conflicts of interest
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh the fact is that moderators and
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
traders in particular have a
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional duty as a numerator
 
02:30:03.910 --> 02:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
specified in the enhanced state
 
02:30:05.270 --> 02:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
constitution to
 
02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
perform their function there is no
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
provision for them to do otherwise
 
02:30:12.150 --> 02:30:12.160 align:start position:0%
they have these responsibilities it's
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
not clear to delegate them
 
02:30:17.270 --> 02:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
and uh regardless of what office they
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
problematic that they've been
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
disqualified or
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
in some way limited we've heard from the
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
secretary of state he's indicated
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
there's not been a problem and
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
by all indications all moderators have
 
02:30:32.319 --> 02:30:33.030 align:start position:0%
by all indications all moderators have
acted

02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
acted
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately balanced issues that means
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
 
02:30:41.520 --> 02:30:44.230 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
amendment

02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:46.230 --> 02:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
i would just like to clarify i do think
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
we heard that there are people who have
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
raised this
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
as an issue what this means is that
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
moderators can be present within the
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
guard rail
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
but they are on the ballot for a
 
02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:00.070 align:start position:0%
but they are on the ballot for a
different

02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
for any office and there
 
02:31:06.630 --> 02:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
are puppet complaints made but
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
it is a issue that we have been
 
02:31:11.670 --> 02:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
grappling with for many sessions and
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's just not clear
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:21.110 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative

um yes i'll be i'll be opposing the
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
amendment because i've always felt that
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
if you're on the ballot you don't need
 
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
to be anywhere near
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:38.720 align:start position:0%

02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
i just want to ask again is
 
02:33:31.670 --> 02:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative sandler on the line
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
pam i'm showing a dan mason but that's
 
02:33:35.590 --> 02:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
just somebody who's showing up for being
 
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
on the zoom right
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes i don't know why he's showing up on
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
your screen he's not in the
 
02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
panelist list you know he's in the knees
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
so it's um
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's all right that happens
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
occasionally i just wanted to
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that wasn't representative
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
sandler by another name
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
he would make an excellent committee
 
02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:02.950 --> 02:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think he would be very valuable to me
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
part all right any other motions on part
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%

02:34:14.309 --> 02:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
part two of
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
sb 83 is
 
02:34:19.670 --> 02:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
deals with the establishment of an
 
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
election information
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
portal there is an amendment that has
 
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
been proposed in regards to part
 
02:34:42.870 --> 02:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
hospital

02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.309 --> 02:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair while there
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
are parts of this that certainly have
 
02:34:55.760 --> 02:34:56.469 align:start position:0%
are parts of this that certainly have
merit

02:34:56.469 --> 02:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
merit
 
02:34:58.710 --> 02:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
and if this was a separate bill we
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
retained work on it
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
because it is about bill we can't do
 
02:35:03.120 --> 02:35:03.910 align:start position:0%
because it is about bill we can't do
that

02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:07.439 align:start position:0%

02:43:12.870 --> 02:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
was the immediately
 
02:43:16.230 --> 02:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
conceding fiscal year or if it was any
 
02:43:18.630 --> 02:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
preceding fiscal year this amendment
 
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
clarifies that by
 
02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
simply stating that it's for
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
appropriations and expenditures which
 
02:43:26.630 --> 02:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
were approved for the same purposes
 
02:43:28.870 --> 02:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
for the immediately preceding fiscal
 
02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:30.070 align:start position:0%
for the immediately preceding fiscal
period

02:43:30.070 --> 02:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:43:31.510 --> 02:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lane you have
 
02:43:33.429 --> 02:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
02:43:36.389 --> 02:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh yes i i would have a question the
 
02:43:39.269 --> 02:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
last word of the amendment
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
um should it not be year instead of
 
02:43:42.479 --> 02:43:43.110 align:start position:0%
um should it not be year instead of
period

02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
i i understand you know the purpose of
 
02:43:47.670 --> 02:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment and what we're
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
but based on the conversations that we
 
02:43:51.349 --> 02:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
were having i just thought it might be
 
02:43:53.269 --> 02:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
better to be consistent
 
02:43:55.990 --> 02:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
to use the word fiscal year instead of
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal period
 
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
since we haven't really used that before
 
02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
and it's not used in other parts of the
 
02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:03.590 align:start position:0%
and it's not used in other parts of the
statute

02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:44:08.070 --> 02:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
i can speak to that you can go ahead
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
the in the case of towns they are
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
single fiscal years uh in
 
02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal period in this case will
 
02:44:21.990 --> 02:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
always refer
 
02:44:23.910 --> 02:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
to a fiscal year because that is what
 
02:44:26.070 --> 02:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
the towns refer to
 
02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
we could have used the language either
 
02:44:29.269 --> 02:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
way i could have put that in but
 
02:44:34.309 --> 02:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's this is what i received from
 
02:44:37.269 --> 02:44:37.279 align:start position:0%
the legislative services and it does
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
refer to
 
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
in this case a fiscal year because
 
02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:47.349 --> 02:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
i i agree with attorney claim that it
 
02:44:48.950 --> 02:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
might have been here but i think that we
 
02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
were trying to get away
 
02:44:53.590 --> 02:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
from the confusion and ols might have
 
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
taken it to an
 
02:44:56.469 --> 02:44:56.479 align:start position:0%
extra degree but i think it's
 
02:44:56.479 --> 02:44:57.990 align:start position:0%
extra degree but i think it's
understandable

02:44:57.990 --> 02:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any questions
 
02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:19.910 align:start position:0%

otp on senate bill 83 as i mentioned
 
02:47:01.349 --> 02:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
second and the amendments you're
 
02:47:02.230 --> 02:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
02:47:12.700 --> 02:47:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:18.389 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:47:18.389 --> 02:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:20.070 --> 02:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
and jerry i believe uh you know we knew
 
02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
we first got these
 
02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
bills that challenged sometimes to be
 
02:47:32.309 --> 02:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh was some reaction from some people
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
just to
 
02:47:37.910 --> 02:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
die you know i think the best that we
 
02:47:39.030 --> 02:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
could do
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
modifying or amending the bill to pass
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
the good parts out of the bill
 
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
just to kind of go over a quick uh
 
02:47:49.030 --> 02:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
summary on part one
 
02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
you guys just want disqualifying people
 
02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
from election officials tom level while
 
02:47:55.269 --> 02:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
02:47:59.269 --> 02:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
with some of my colleagues on this that
 
02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
i don't like to see something funny for
 
02:48:02.309 --> 02:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
obviously in that position
 
02:48:04.150 --> 02:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
i can tell you in one of my towns in my
 
02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
moderator there we go moderator and the
 
02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
assistant moderator of both uh house
 
02:48:19.920 --> 02:48:21.110 align:start position:0%
assistant moderator of both uh house
members

02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
and further the fact that the
 
02:48:25.429 --> 02:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
constitution is very clear on that
 
02:48:28.790 --> 02:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
we really couldn't uh
 
02:48:31.349 --> 02:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
good conscience change that i gave the
 
02:48:32.870 --> 02:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
reasons on section two
 
02:48:37.030 --> 02:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
so i um that we should delete that
 
02:48:39.269 --> 02:48:39.279 align:start position:0%
anybody in the house is free to bring
 
02:48:41.269 --> 02:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
forward that bill as a separate bill
 
02:48:44.710 --> 02:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
going forward the next year we got to
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh recount fees
 
02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
that brings those fees in line makes it
 
02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
more responsible
 
02:48:57.830 --> 02:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
for costs associated still probably
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover
 
02:48:59.910 --> 02:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
all the costs but at least it covers
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
more and in regard to
 
02:49:05.830 --> 02:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
itemized statements by political
 
02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:07.510 align:start position:0%
itemized statements by political
candidates

02:49:07.510 --> 02:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
02:49:11.110 --> 02:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
it the amendment certainly makes
 
02:49:14.469 --> 02:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
reports more legible readable uh
 
02:49:15.990 --> 02:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
if you have to file the reports they
 
02:49:18.309 --> 02:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
certainly ought to be readable
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
and lastly the last section providing
 
02:49:23.670 --> 02:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
for actual town meeting procedures
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
we heard this was needed to
 
02:49:29.830 --> 02:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
the towns that are on a fiscal year not
 
02:49:31.269 --> 02:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
a calendar year and particularly in this
 
02:49:32.389 --> 02:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
covered year where
 
02:49:34.630 --> 02:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
sometime meetings were later in the year
 
02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
um i think it was a great common sense
 
02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:37.349 align:start position:0%
um i think it was a great common sense
amendment

02:49:37.349 --> 02:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:49:39.429 --> 02:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
that it simply clarified what was
 
02:49:41.269 --> 02:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a vague statement
 
02:49:45.190 --> 02:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
that requires uh
 
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
the purposes of appropriations and
 
02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures were
 
02:49:50.950 --> 02:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
which were approved for the same purpose
 
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
purposes for
 
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
the immediate immediately proceeding
 
02:49:54.640 --> 02:49:55.269 align:start position:0%
the immediate immediately proceeding
fiscal

02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
period it makes it clear it was somewhat
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
vague and not quite clear before
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons i uh made the
 
02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:02.469 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons i uh made the
motion

02:50:02.469 --> 02:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:50:06.150 --> 02:50:06.160 align:start position:0%

is there a second
 
02:53:34.870 --> 02:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative i'll second that
 
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
cody this was an amendment that was
 
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
prepared and
 
02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
the committee has previously spoken to
 
02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative virgil
 
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i'll be quick
 
02:53:49.590 --> 02:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
cause we did discuss this previously
 
02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
what the amendment tries to do is
 
02:53:53.910 --> 02:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
preserve senator gray's intent
 
02:53:57.110 --> 02:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
that absentee ballot applications and
 
02:53:58.870 --> 02:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelopes
 
02:54:01.269 --> 02:54:01.279 align:start position:0%
would be examined for every election
 
02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
every municipal and state election
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
in an effort to try and determine if a
 
02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
voter's paperwork was
 
02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
filled out improperly and to make an
 
02:54:13.190 --> 02:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
effort to try and contact the folder to
 
02:54:16.230 --> 02:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
give them an opportunity to cure
 
02:54:19.269 --> 02:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
their their affidavit ballot to use the
 
02:54:20.950 --> 02:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
court's language and senator gray's
 
02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:21.990 align:start position:0%
court's language and senator gray's
language

02:54:21.990 --> 02:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:54:24.070 --> 02:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
but we did have problems with some of
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
the logistics involved in making this
 
02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:26.950 align:start position:0%
the logistics involved in making this
happen

02:54:26.950 --> 02:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
and those are what i tried to address in
 
02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:54:33.990 --> 02:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
for example um on page 2
 
02:54:37.830 --> 02:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
lines 20 to 27 in the original bill
 
02:54:39.750 --> 02:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
there was a provision that the clerk
 
02:54:41.910 --> 02:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
should have to post a time and location
 
02:54:42.550 --> 02:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
of every
 
02:54:44.950 --> 02:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
time that this review would occur within
 
02:54:46.389 --> 02:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
24 hours
 
02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
prior to the review but in the same
 
02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph it says that anytime
 
02:54:52.309 --> 02:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
someone's voting in person that review
 
02:54:53.349 --> 02:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
takes place
 
02:54:56.150 --> 02:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
immediately there's also a provision
 
02:54:56.160 --> 02:54:56.790 align:start position:0%
immediately there's also a provision
that

02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:59.429 --> 02:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
a review would be taken place at five
 
02:55:01.429 --> 02:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
o'clock the night after five o'clock the
 
02:55:01.990 --> 02:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
night before
 
02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
an election um even if
 
02:55:06.469 --> 02:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
there were problems with ballast would
 
02:55:08.389 --> 02:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
be no way to contact the person to have
 
02:55:08.399 --> 02:55:09.030 align:start position:0%
be no way to contact the person to have
that

02:55:09.030 --> 02:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh corrected because the offices would
 
02:55:13.990 --> 02:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
be closed election day is the next day
 
02:55:16.150 --> 02:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
and the absentee voter would have to
 
02:55:18.389 --> 02:55:18.399 align:start position:0%
presumably go to the polls to vote
 
02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
um because there would be no way for
 
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
them to make the correction on it
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
um and finally under state law it's the
 
02:55:27.670 --> 02:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
moderator who makes the final
 
02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:28.469 align:start position:0%
moderator who makes the final
determination

02:55:28.469 --> 02:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
determination
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not the paperwork was
 
02:55:32.309 --> 02:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
properly uh
 
02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
completed not the clerk so that also was
 
02:55:36.469 --> 02:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
addressed in the amendment
 
02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's the the purpose of the amendment
 
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
to try and preserve
 
02:55:41.990 --> 02:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
senator gray's primary intent but try
 
02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:42.870 align:start position:0%
senator gray's primary intent but try
and

02:55:42.870 --> 02:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:55:46.790 --> 02:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
make it in a logistically feasible
 
02:55:51.990 --> 02:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:56.830 --> 02:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:56.840 --> 02:56:02.790 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

02:56:02.790 --> 02:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
um uh i'm before i ask the third party
 
02:56:08.550 --> 02:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to say that i appreciate
 
02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron's
 
02:56:13.349 --> 02:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
attempt to clear up some issues with
 
02:56:13.359 --> 02:56:14.070 align:start position:0%
attempt to clear up some issues with
that

02:56:14.070 --> 02:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
part of sb 89 because i do think it does
 
02:56:20.389 --> 02:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
clean it up but i think that the
 
02:56:21.990 --> 02:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
pre-processing process
 
02:56:25.269 --> 02:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
itself is brought with issues
 
02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
and i have serious concerns and
 
02:56:31.349 --> 02:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
reflected to go forward with the process
 
02:56:34.870 --> 02:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
that as a member of the
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
secure elections committee last year
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
were recommended for because of the
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
pelvic pandemic
 
02:56:44.790 --> 02:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
but it was specific discussion and i
 
02:56:46.230 --> 02:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
certainly made it clear that that
 
02:56:47.830 --> 02:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation was for the
 
02:56:51.269 --> 02:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
kobit issue that the case was
 
02:56:54.309 --> 02:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
the state was addressing and i don't
 
02:56:55.750 --> 02:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
think that the current practice
 
02:56:59.110 --> 02:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
makes sense going forward so
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
i i just want to make it clear on the
 
02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
record that i do think while
 
02:57:05.110 --> 02:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron's
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
commitment might clean up some pieces of
 
02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:08.550 align:start position:0%
commitment might clean up some pieces of
it

02:57:08.550 --> 02:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:57:14.950 --> 02:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:16.389 --> 02:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the clerk to call the
 
02:57:18.870 --> 02:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
role representative rowan
 
02:57:22.230 --> 02:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
could i add a comment that i also like
 
02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
much of what's in here my main concern
 
02:57:26.309 --> 02:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
with section 3
 
02:57:30.550 --> 02:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
is that i believe it
 
02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
creates classes of voters those that
 
02:57:37.110 --> 02:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
have their balance corrected
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:45.750 --> 02:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
and for that reason i cannot pay for a
 
02:57:56.860 --> 02:57:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:56.870 --> 02:57:59.670 align:start position:0%

soundcheck
 
02:58:06.870 --> 02:58:06.880 align:start position:0%

jimmy very briefly um as actually
mentioned

03:00:40.389 --> 03:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
in representative bergeron's um some
 
03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:43.590 align:start position:0%
in representative bergeron's um some
commentary

03:00:43.590 --> 03:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
commentary
 
03:00:45.670 --> 03:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron's amendment um
 
03:00:48.070 --> 03:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
the pre-processing processes itself
 
03:00:50.150 --> 03:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
rife with issues um i do for the record
 
03:00:51.670 --> 03:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative bergeron's
 
03:00:52.950 --> 03:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
hard work on that um
 
03:00:55.269 --> 03:00:55.279 align:start position:0%
that was good faith and well well
 
03:00:55.279 --> 03:00:56.070 align:start position:0%
that was good faith and well well
executed

03:00:56.070 --> 03:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
executed
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately pre-processing does create
 
03:01:01.750 --> 03:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
different classes of voters
 
03:01:03.269 --> 03:01:03.279 align:start position:0%
great classes of voters who send in
 
03:01:04.469 --> 03:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
they're absolutely valid a month out it
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
creates a class of voters
 
03:01:08.309 --> 03:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
um with voters and their absolute ballot
 
03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
without time to be looked at
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
as i said when we were doing the hearing
 
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
on this omnibus bill
 
03:01:16.309 --> 03:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
i have a i am a firm believer that
 
03:01:17.349 --> 03:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:01:19.590 --> 03:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
as much of election day has to happen on
 
03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
election day as possible
 
03:01:25.590 --> 03:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
we're using i'm aware the municipal
 
03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
association have asked for this for some
 
03:01:27.120 --> 03:01:27.750 align:start position:0%
association have asked for this for some
time

03:01:27.750 --> 03:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:01:29.670 --> 03:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
but for the most part we've been using
 
03:01:31.429 --> 03:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
the pandemic as the excuse to bring this
 
03:01:31.439 --> 03:01:31.910 align:start position:0%
the pandemic as the excuse to bring this
forward

03:01:31.910 --> 03:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:01:33.190 --> 03:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
acting as if there's going to be all
 
03:01:35.670 --> 03:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
these absentee ballots forever going on
 
03:01:38.070 --> 03:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh in perpetuity and the reality is we
 
03:01:39.349 --> 03:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
will begin to return to normal
 
03:01:41.830 --> 03:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
we will have a midterm election uh our
 
03:01:42.790 --> 03:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
very capable
 
03:01:45.269 --> 03:01:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh election workers will be able to
 
03:01:46.389 --> 03:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
handle this
 
03:01:47.590 --> 03:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
and we're going to find other ways to
 
03:01:49.030 --> 03:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
free them up on election day we just
 
03:01:50.309 --> 03:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
moved forward
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
um electronic poll books that will free
 
03:01:53.910 --> 03:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
up people to handle uh
 
03:01:55.670 --> 03:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
absolute ballots on election day so we
 
03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
should be new hampshire we do election
 
03:01:58.550 --> 03:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
on election day
 
03:02:00.309 --> 03:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
and that's the point of my amendment is
 
03:02:01.750 --> 03:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep election on election
 
03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:03.110 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep election on election
day

03:02:03.110 --> 03:02:03.120 align:start position:0%

03:02:04.550 --> 03:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
is there further discussion
 
03:02:09.510 --> 03:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:11.190 --> 03:02:11.200 align:start position:0%

03:02:18.070 --> 03:02:18.080 align:start position:0%

03:02:42.870 --> 03:02:42.880 align:start position:0%

03:05:37.429 --> 03:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
title says
 
03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
while there were certain aspects other
 
03:05:42.469 --> 03:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
aspects of that sector that i'd like
 
03:05:46.389 --> 03:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
there was some contradictions that there
 
03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
was also
 
03:05:50.550 --> 03:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
um some cases that gave he brought her
 
03:05:51.510 --> 03:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
powers and
 
03:05:54.070 --> 03:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
the legislator intended to do uh he
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
granted a tremendous amount of power to
 
03:05:57.269 --> 03:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
03:05:59.590 --> 03:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me the best way to
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
address this issue is to study
 
03:06:04.150 --> 03:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
come up with something that's uh i think
 
03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
written a little bit better than
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
this section was in its entirety hence
 
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
the reason to
 
03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
amend it let's start with the study
 
03:06:13.269 --> 03:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
03:06:20.230 --> 03:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron now thank you
 
03:06:24.070 --> 03:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
03:06:26.309 --> 03:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote in opposition to the
 
03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment primarily
 
03:06:31.670 --> 03:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
because and i i understand which
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
provisions of that section that
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
represents erosion is referring to and
 
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
in some ways i agree with him on that
 
03:06:38.870 --> 03:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
aspect of it but the secretary of
 
03:06:40.950 --> 03:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
state's office just recently conducted a
 
03:06:43.429 --> 03:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
study of the use of high-speed optical
 
03:06:46.870 --> 03:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
digital scanned ballot counting devices
 
03:06:49.030 --> 03:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i have yet to hear a good
 
03:06:51.190 --> 03:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
justification as to why we need another
 
03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
study group to do
 
03:06:56.070 --> 03:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
essentially the same thing it's uh its
 
03:06:57.990 --> 03:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
effect will really be to delay the
 
03:06:59.510 --> 03:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of any kind of
 
03:06:59.520 --> 03:07:00.790 align:start position:0%
implementation of any kind of
post-election

03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
post-election
 
03:07:03.670 --> 03:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
audit counting uh another year and i
 
03:07:04.309 --> 03:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
03:07:06.710 --> 03:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
a valid reason for just continuing to
 
03:07:07.910 --> 03:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
kick this issue
 
03:07:12.870 --> 03:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
down the road it's it's time to start
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
making these post-election audits happen
 
03:07:16.790 --> 03:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore i can't support
 
03:07:18.469 --> 03:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
another study committee on top of a
 
03:07:19.990 --> 03:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
study committee that just finished its
 
03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
study committee that just finished its
work

03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:30.790 --> 03:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:33.269 --> 03:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
i i will just say i i myself was a
 
03:07:34.870 --> 03:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
little confused on the study committee i
 
03:07:36.870 --> 03:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
believe last year's study committee was
 
03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
senator graydell and as
 
03:07:42.630 --> 03:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron has provided the
 
03:07:45.990 --> 03:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
committee with a report from that
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
however in light of this happening with
 
03:07:50.389 --> 03:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
the state my hope is if
 
03:07:51.990 --> 03:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
the committee goes forward it generates
 
03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
a report they are capable of doing it
 
03:07:56.070 --> 03:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
before november 30th
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
and there are i suspect other bills that
 
03:08:01.030 --> 03:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
will be recommending things to go
 
03:08:02.550 --> 03:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
forward for the second year of this
 
03:08:02.560 --> 03:08:04.790 align:start position:0%
forward for the second year of this
session

03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%

attention though
 
03:10:47.990 --> 03:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
um again the uh the current system
 
03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:48.710 align:start position:0%
um again the uh the current system
regarding

03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
03:10:51.030 --> 03:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
this whole probate issue with the paid
 
03:10:52.550 --> 03:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
and carefully and well-trained
 
03:10:54.070 --> 03:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
photographer probate has been working
 
03:10:56.229 --> 03:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
very well in the last decade since it
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
was passed
 
03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh this bill in particular this
 
03:11:01.349 --> 03:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to try to reverse that
 
03:11:03.830 --> 03:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
should have a fiscal note it does not
 
03:11:05.190 --> 03:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's a question about whether it
 
03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:05.670 align:start position:0%
there's a question about whether it
would

03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:11:08.150 --> 03:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
generate the funding provision would be
 
03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:09.510 align:start position:0%
generate the funding provision would be
effective

03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
effective
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
there's no training for what individual
 
03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
who is often just the party activist of
 
03:11:14.389 --> 03:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
either party
 
03:11:15.910 --> 03:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's no indication that person would
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
be qualified or be properly trained once
 
03:11:19.030 --> 03:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
they came in
 
03:11:21.030 --> 03:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
there's no staff to help this person
 
03:11:23.190 --> 03:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
once they arrive there's no office
 
03:11:26.469 --> 03:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
for them to sit in and i know that it's
 
03:11:27.910 --> 03:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
in the constitution that's been a
 
03:11:27.920 --> 03:11:29.190 align:start position:0%
in the constitution that's been a
concern

03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:11:31.349 --> 03:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
but there have also been numerous
 
03:11:32.550 --> 03:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
attempts to remove it from the
 
03:11:33.910 --> 03:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
constitution which
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
i would encourage continue uh also this
 
03:11:37.830 --> 03:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
is not even
 
03:11:39.429 --> 03:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
something appropriate to election month
 
03:11:40.870 --> 03:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
so that's another thing that i think we
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:46.550 --> 03:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on part
 
03:11:47.910 --> 03:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
four i
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
why don't you leave it sort of more
 
03:11:51.190 --> 03:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
towards you so for some reason my voice
 
03:11:52.389 --> 03:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
gets picked up alright
 
03:11:55.990 --> 03:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:59.030 --> 03:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
any further discussion that's right
 
03:12:01.510 --> 03:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative barry uh yes um i am
 
03:12:02.550 --> 03:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately going to be
 
03:12:05.750 --> 03:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment but
 
03:12:10.389 --> 03:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:12.790 --> 03:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
i am a big proponent of turning this
 
03:12:14.950 --> 03:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
position back to the people
 
03:12:17.429 --> 03:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
i think people should have the ability
 
03:12:19.590 --> 03:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
to seek redress when possible
 
03:12:22.469 --> 03:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
and the judiciary system is designed as
 
03:12:22.870 --> 03:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
i said
 
03:12:25.030 --> 03:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the testimony the hearings the
 
03:12:26.630 --> 03:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
judiciary system is designed to be
 
03:12:26.640 --> 03:12:28.070 align:start position:0%
judiciary system is designed to be
immovable

03:12:28.070 --> 03:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
immovable
 
03:12:31.349 --> 03:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:33.910 --> 03:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
this this position whether we like it or
 
03:12:33.920 --> 03:12:34.469 align:start position:0%
this this position whether we like it or
not

03:12:34.469 --> 03:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:12:37.110 --> 03:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
is in our state's constitution attempts
 
03:12:38.950 --> 03:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
to remove it from the state constitution
 
03:12:42.229 --> 03:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
have failed which should be a message
 
03:12:45.590 --> 03:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
people want this unfortunately
 
03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
this part of this only bill really has
 
03:12:49.830 --> 03:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
no business part of election law
 
03:12:51.750 --> 03:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
it really should have gone to judiciary
 
03:12:54.389 --> 03:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
or to municipal accounting
 
03:12:58.309 --> 03:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
and i am i'm not deaf to the political
 
03:13:00.630 --> 03:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
reality that is basically
 
03:13:04.229 --> 03:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
89 overall fail because the
 
03:13:06.630 --> 03:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
issue of the registrar of probate has
 
03:13:08.790 --> 03:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
typically been nonpartisan
 
03:13:11.429 --> 03:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
so you'll take election law bills which
 
03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
tend to go down by party milo
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
to thank everybody for the font size
 
03:13:17.349 --> 03:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
increased earlier
 
03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
and then attack on a non-partisan issue
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
inside of it
 
03:13:25.190 --> 03:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
effectively so i'm going to vote
 
03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
in favor of this amendment but i want to
 
03:13:28.550 --> 03:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
state for the record i believe that
 
03:13:30.070 --> 03:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
people elect the registrar that
 
03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
registrar should have duties consider
 
03:13:31.680 --> 03:13:32.710 align:start position:0%
registrar should have duties consider
constitution

03:13:32.710 --> 03:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
03:13:34.389 --> 03:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
and we don't like that we should
 
03:13:38.950 --> 03:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:55.830 --> 03:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:02.229 --> 03:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
that those duties went over to the
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
serving court and then
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
they're not being done at the county
 
03:14:08.229 --> 03:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
level where the constitution says they
 
03:14:08.239 --> 03:14:09.190 align:start position:0%
level where the constitution says they
should

03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
should
 
03:14:11.030 --> 03:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
and it has not been a constitutional
 
03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
limit in the past that allows that
 
03:14:17.349 --> 03:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
however my concern is that the
 
03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
way that part of the bill is crafted
 
03:14:23.030 --> 03:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
money is not there for them to handle
 
03:14:24.469 --> 03:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
those duties
 
03:14:27.750 --> 03:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
so i too will vote
 
03:14:29.910 --> 03:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
in favor of that amendment however i
 
03:14:31.349 --> 03:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
will remind
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
the public committee members that
 
03:14:36.389 --> 03:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
because we're removing this amendment
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
anybody can bring forth a bill
 
03:14:40.229 --> 03:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
to address this and i hope somebody does
 
03:14:41.670 --> 03:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
because i certainly would support that
 
03:14:43.510 --> 03:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
as long as the funding is there
 
03:14:47.190 --> 03:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
and if you heard another comment that
 
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
this section really does belong before
 
03:14:51.190 --> 03:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
the judiciary committee
 
03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
so if somebody brings forth a standalone
 
03:14:54.309 --> 03:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
bill on this it will
 
03:14:57.349 --> 03:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
get a sure fair hearing judiciary
 
03:14:59.990 --> 03:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons i'm going to
 
03:15:01.030 --> 03:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
support the amendment
 
03:15:04.070 --> 03:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
but reluctantly because of
 
03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
the constitutional aspect of this
 
03:15:09.750 --> 03:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
 
03:15:12.150 --> 03:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
before the house
 
03:15:16.870 --> 03:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:28.630 --> 03:15:28.640 align:start position:0%

03:16:36.550 --> 03:16:36.560 align:start position:0%

one

03:16:41.670 --> 03:16:41.680 align:start position:0%

you may be getting a little ahead of
 
03:16:55.269 --> 03:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
yourself madam clark i don't know
 
03:16:58.950 --> 03:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
very it's very warm in here it really is
 
03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
glad you're not here they haven't
 
03:17:02.150 --> 03:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
figured out that about 76
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:12.550 --> 03:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
i believe the count on 13-19
 
03:17:25.030 --> 03:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
all right the next are there any further
 
03:17:28.790 --> 03:17:28.800 align:start position:0%

03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
the next amendment before the committee
 
03:17:36.150 --> 03:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
is the non-germane
 
03:17:38.190 --> 03:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
amendment that was heard this morning
 
03:17:38.200 --> 03:17:39.830 align:start position:0%
amendment that was heard this morning
1445

03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%

03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
yes i would mr chairman and members of
 
03:18:23.429 --> 03:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:18:25.750 --> 03:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
today we heard extensive testimony about
 
03:18:25.760 --> 03:18:26.990 align:start position:0%
today we heard extensive testimony about
amendment

03:18:26.990 --> 03:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:18:29.990 --> 03:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
1445-h and we have received hundreds of
 
03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:30.710 align:start position:0%
1445-h and we have received hundreds of
emails

03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
emails
 
03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this amendment is very
 
03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:33.990 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this amendment is very
necessary

03:18:33.990 --> 03:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:18:36.389 --> 03:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
but it shouldn't be we should not have
 
03:18:37.990 --> 03:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
to assert our right as a state
 
03:18:39.990 --> 03:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
to push back against the federalization
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
of our elections
 
03:18:43.590 --> 03:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
d.c politicians feel that they can run
 
03:18:45.910 --> 03:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
our elections better than we can
 
03:18:47.429 --> 03:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
even though we have some of the loosest
 
03:18:49.110 --> 03:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
election laws in the country
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
sb1 or the so-called for the people act
 
03:18:54.630 --> 03:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
would actually make them even looser
 
03:18:56.710 --> 03:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
if the dc politicians who crafted this
 
03:18:58.389 --> 03:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
bill were accurately naming it
 
03:18:59.910 --> 03:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
they would have called it the for the
 
03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
politicians act because of the extreme
 
03:19:01.920 --> 03:19:02.950 align:start position:0%
politicians act because of the extreme
giveaways

03:19:02.950 --> 03:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
giveaways
 
03:19:04.710 --> 03:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
in it such as a taxpayer funding of
 
03:19:07.269 --> 03:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
political campaigns
 
03:19:09.269 --> 03:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
today i asked several times where our
 
03:19:11.910 --> 03:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
federal federal delegation is
 
03:19:13.590 --> 03:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
why couldn't they be bothered to come
 
03:19:15.269 --> 03:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
and speak about this amendment
 
03:19:18.710 --> 03:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
and the for the people act not even one
 
03:19:20.229 --> 03:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
submitted a written statement or sent a
 
03:19:21.269 --> 03:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
surrogate to speak
 
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
on their behalf we also heard today that
 
03:19:24.950 --> 03:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
none of them
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
none of them have spoken to the
 
03:19:28.550 --> 03:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
about how this would affect new
 
03:19:34.070 --> 03:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire or why they are supporting it
 
03:19:35.590 --> 03:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
i find the arguments against this
 
03:19:38.469 --> 03:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
amendment to be incredibly disingenuous
 
03:19:39.910 --> 03:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
first they tell us that we will be
 
03:19:41.429 --> 03:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
costing the state a lot of money and
 
03:19:43.590 --> 03:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
being forced to hold two elections
 
03:19:45.910 --> 03:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
let's be clear about something the only
 
03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
people who are forcing the state to do
 
03:19:47.520 --> 03:19:48.309 align:start position:0%
people who are forcing the state to do
anything

03:19:48.309 --> 03:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:19:49.990 --> 03:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
is our federal delegation in washington
 
03:19:52.469 --> 03:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
dc who despite spending the last seven
 
03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
months telling us how great the new
 
03:19:55.110 --> 03:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire election was
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
now are catering to their out-of-state
 
03:19:58.630 --> 03:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
donors and trying to undermine new
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire's process
 
03:20:02.229 --> 03:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
next they tell us that they will be that
 
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
we will make it more confusing for
 
03:20:03.760 --> 03:20:04.469 align:start position:0%
we will make it more confusing for
voters

03:20:04.469 --> 03:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
voters
 
03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
but let's be serious for a minute the
 
03:20:08.870 --> 03:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
only one proposing real changes to how
 
03:20:08.880 --> 03:20:09.349 align:start position:0%
only one proposing real changes to how
we

03:20:09.349 --> 03:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:20:11.510 --> 03:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
to how we vote are the politicians
 
03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
peddling s1
 
03:20:14.309 --> 03:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
telling us how great it will be to turn
 
03:20:15.750 --> 03:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
over control of our elections
 
03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
to unelected bureaucrats finally they
 
03:20:19.750 --> 03:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
tell us
 
03:20:21.110 --> 03:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
that the federal government has the
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
right to run our elections
 
03:20:26.469 --> 03:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
this is the core of our disagreement who
 
03:20:28.950 --> 03:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
should control our elections
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
is it new hampshire or dc bureaucrats
 
03:20:35.190 --> 03:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
for me the answer is clear i pick new
 
03:20:35.200 --> 03:20:35.910 align:start position:0%
for me the answer is clear i pick new
hampshire

03:20:35.910 --> 03:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
every time i will choose secretary
 
03:20:40.389 --> 03:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
gardner over nancy pelosi and chuck
 
03:20:40.399 --> 03:20:41.110 align:start position:0%
gardner over nancy pelosi and chuck
schumer

03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
schumer
 
03:20:43.990 --> 03:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
every single time i would like to
 
03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:44.630 align:start position:0%
every single time i would like to
address

03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:20:47.190 --> 03:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
one thing out there that is not true on
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
april 11th
 
03:20:51.670 --> 03:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
senator hassan won a wmur and said quote
 
03:20:54.469 --> 03:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
before the people act it really doesn't
 
03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
change the way new hampshire would run
 
03:20:57.269 --> 03:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
its elections
 
03:20:59.269 --> 03:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
the way it runs its elections already
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
fits the requirement
 
03:21:02.550 --> 03:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
but the senator is either lying or
 
03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
ignorant as to the effects of
 
03:21:07.670 --> 03:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
s1 that's one character dramatically
 
03:21:07.680 --> 03:21:08.150 align:start position:0%
s1 that's one character dramatically
changed

03:21:08.150 --> 03:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
changed
 
03:21:11.030 --> 03:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
madam chairman point of order i i would
 
03:21:11.040 --> 03:21:11.349 align:start position:0%
madam chairman point of order i i would
say

03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
submit that the gentleman's previous
 
03:21:15.190 --> 03:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
remarks relative to the senator
 
03:21:18.150 --> 03:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
are out of order they they are my
 
03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:18.790 align:start position:0%
are out of order they they are my
remarks

03:21:18.790 --> 03:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
remarks
 
03:21:20.550 --> 03:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
she's it is not true from we've heard
 
03:21:23.510 --> 03:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
from the secretary of state's office
 
03:21:26.150 --> 03:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
s1 would dramatically change how new
 
03:21:27.670 --> 03:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire conducts our elections
 
03:21:29.349 --> 03:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
it would require us to allow ballot
 
03:21:30.870 --> 03:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
harvesting up to 10 days
 
03:21:34.389 --> 03:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
after the election mr chairman excuse me
 
03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you did not rule on my point
 
03:21:37.190 --> 03:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
of order
 
03:21:40.309 --> 03:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's noted representative cody
 
03:21:43.910 --> 03:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
it is does that mean you ruled on it
 
03:21:45.990 --> 03:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
well representative barry has already
 
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
made that comment it's already
 
03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
it's already out there well yeah but my
 
03:21:50.720 --> 03:21:51.030 align:start position:0%
it's already out there well yeah but my
but

03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
my point is that his comment relative to
 
03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:11.510 --> 03:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
s1 would dramatically change how new
 
03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire conducts
 
03:22:17.349 --> 03:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
our elections it would require us to
 
03:22:19.110 --> 03:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
allow ballot harvesting up to
 
03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
10 days after the election and it would
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
ban voter id which is extremely popular
 
03:22:25.830 --> 03:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
including with support of over 50 of
 
03:22:25.840 --> 03:22:27.190 align:start position:0%
including with support of over 50 of
democrats

03:22:27.190 --> 03:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
democrats
 
03:22:28.630 --> 03:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
the committee members who are about to
 
03:22:30.150 --> 03:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
vote against this have spent the last
 
03:22:31.750 --> 03:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
six months telling us new hampshire
 
03:22:33.510 --> 03:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
elections are well run
 
03:22:35.510 --> 03:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
so why are they now not standing with us
 
03:22:37.269 --> 03:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
under the very simple proposition
 
03:22:38.950 --> 03:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire should continue to
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
run its own elections
 
03:22:42.309 --> 03:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
the same ones that we're claiming are so
 
03:22:43.830 --> 03:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
well run
 
03:22:45.349 --> 03:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
let's be very clear about the vote we're
 
03:22:47.910 --> 03:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
about to take we will get to see where
 
03:22:49.670 --> 03:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
we as committee members stand
 
03:22:51.510 --> 03:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
do we stand with new hampshire and our
 
03:22:53.510 --> 03:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
voting institutions or do we side with
 
03:22:55.269 --> 03:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
dc politicians
 
03:22:56.870 --> 03:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is a battle of choice and the
 
03:22:58.710 --> 03:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
options are as plain as day
 
03:23:00.229 --> 03:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
do you stand with a congresswoman from
 
03:23:02.389 --> 03:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
san francisco and a senator from new
 
03:23:03.269 --> 03:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
york city
 
03:23:04.630 --> 03:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
or do you stand with the people of the
 
03:23:06.070 --> 03:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
granite state and the voters that
 
03:23:12.469 --> 03:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:15.510 --> 03:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
i did mr chairman thank you uh i would
 
03:23:17.349 --> 03:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
be opposing this amendment it's
 
03:23:19.349 --> 03:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know where to start with
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
with the remarks of the previous speaker
 
03:23:24.790 --> 03:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
so i guess i i i will address simply
 
03:23:27.750 --> 03:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh the reasons i'm going to vote as i am
 
03:23:27.760 --> 03:23:28.150 align:start position:0%
uh the reasons i'm going to vote as i am
uh

03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:23:30.790 --> 03:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
number one uh which has not been
 
03:23:32.070 --> 03:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
addressed this morning
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
except by i believe one speaker i
 
03:23:37.269 --> 03:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
believe the supremacy clause of the
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
united states constitution were some
 
03:23:40.319 --> 03:23:40.950 align:start position:0%
united states constitution were some
version

03:23:40.950 --> 03:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
version
 
03:23:45.030 --> 03:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
of uh hr one two pass
 
03:23:47.429 --> 03:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
would control that does not mean that
 
03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
there are not
 
03:23:52.870 --> 03:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
there is not an ability to uh adjust
 
03:23:56.309 --> 03:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
hr1 before its final version to take
 
03:23:57.510 --> 03:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
into account
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
the problems that new hampshire may have
 
03:24:01.590 --> 03:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
or that other states may have in fact
 
03:24:05.429 --> 03:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
that's going on right now and if uh
 
03:24:07.349 --> 03:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
if the previous speaker wasn't
 
03:24:09.269 --> 03:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
interested in making cheap political
 
03:24:09.279 --> 03:24:10.389 align:start position:0%
interested in making cheap political
points

03:24:10.389 --> 03:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
points
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
he could be talking to those senators
 
03:24:14.309 --> 03:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
that he referred to
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
and discussing his issues so they could
 
03:24:18.469 --> 03:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
be adjusted
 
03:24:21.269 --> 03:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
before the end of this process uh i
 
03:24:21.279 --> 03:24:21.990 align:start position:0%
before the end of this process uh i
think

03:24:21.990 --> 03:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:24:24.710 --> 03:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
frankly that the entire this entire
 
03:24:27.030 --> 03:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
ferrago is an embarrassment
 
03:24:29.830 --> 03:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i will be opposing the amendment and
 
03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:30.790 align:start position:0%
and i will be opposing the amendment and
uh

03:24:30.790 --> 03:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:24:37.269 --> 03:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:41.830 --> 03:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i'm
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
about whether committee members who
 
03:24:43.920 --> 03:24:45.590 align:start position:0%
about whether committee members who
support

03:24:45.590 --> 03:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:24:49.429 --> 03:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
this amendment because they think
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
that some proposed legislation in
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:58.389 --> 03:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
represents an unjustified federal
 
03:24:59.910 --> 03:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
regulation of state elections
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
would also oppose the 1965 voting rights
 
03:25:02.880 --> 03:25:03.429 align:start position:0%
would also oppose the 1965 voting rights
act

03:25:03.429 --> 03:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
act
 
03:25:06.790 --> 03:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
for the same reason or whether they
 
03:25:08.550 --> 03:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
support the voting rights act but oppose
 
03:25:10.150 --> 03:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
this new legislation that might be
 
03:25:11.910 --> 03:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
possible but i don't see
 
03:25:13.990 --> 03:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
why the principle would apply to one but
 
03:25:15.429 --> 03:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
not the other
 
03:25:19.429 --> 03:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
the the voting rights act of 1965
 
03:25:22.870 --> 03:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
um uh made it illegal
 
03:25:25.429 --> 03:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
for the states for as you well know to
 
03:25:25.439 --> 03:25:25.910 align:start position:0%
for the states for as you well know to
uh

03:25:25.910 --> 03:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
to apply literacy tests to qualify
 
03:25:30.630 --> 03:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
voters poll taxes to qualify
 
03:25:33.830 --> 03:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
voters it even sent federal officials
 
03:25:36.550 --> 03:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
into counties in a variety of southern
 
03:25:38.710 --> 03:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
states to directly register
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
citizens to vote it was almost like a
 
03:25:40.800 --> 03:25:42.150 align:start position:0%
citizens to vote it was almost like a
reoccupation

03:25:42.150 --> 03:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
reoccupation
 
03:25:46.710 --> 03:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
of the former confederacy in 1965
 
03:25:49.990 --> 03:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and you know the provisions of
 
03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
sb1 which i understand reasonable people
 
03:25:53.830 --> 03:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
could very very much disagree with for
 
03:25:55.590 --> 03:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
all sorts of reasons
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
um don't seem to um involve a federal
 
03:25:59.279 --> 03:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
um don't seem to um involve a federal
regulation

03:25:59.990 --> 03:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
03:26:01.510 --> 03:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh would seem to be rather tepid
 
03:26:03.190 --> 03:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
regulation of state elections in
 
03:26:05.190 --> 03:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
comparison to the 1965
 
03:26:07.190 --> 03:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
civil rights act so i just wonder would
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
you support that
 
03:26:11.590 --> 03:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
the civil rights act but but oppose this
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
or do they fall together
 
03:26:22.229 --> 03:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:25.429 --> 03:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
as a republican
 
03:26:28.190 --> 03:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
i can say even though i was not born in
 
03:26:28.200 --> 03:26:29.670 align:start position:0%
i can say even though i was not born in
1965

03:26:29.670 --> 03:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
1965
 
03:26:31.910 --> 03:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
i would probably i would support the
 
03:26:34.229 --> 03:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
voting rights act as it was
 
03:26:36.389 --> 03:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
supported by mostly republicans at that
 
03:26:36.399 --> 03:26:38.389 align:start position:0%
supported by mostly republicans at that
time

03:26:38.389 --> 03:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:26:40.790 --> 03:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i find it interesting in a testimony
 
03:26:42.389 --> 03:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
today that we were told over and over
 
03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
again to discuss our concerns with
 
03:26:48.070 --> 03:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:51.030 --> 03:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
other than hoping to randomly run into a
 
03:26:52.389 --> 03:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
supermarket or something
 
03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know how uh we can better do
 
03:26:56.070 --> 03:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
that other than asking them
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
to come here and discuss their support
 
03:27:00.070 --> 03:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
for that bill
 
03:27:03.830 --> 03:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
here with us or to send
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
some sort of communication to us and
 
03:27:07.590 --> 03:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
that was not done
 
03:27:09.910 --> 03:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
what i made instead was i reached out to
 
03:27:09.920 --> 03:27:10.630 align:start position:0%
what i made instead was i reached out to
my

03:27:10.630 --> 03:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
local election officials the people who
 
03:27:14.630 --> 03:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
run the elections on the ground and i
 
03:27:14.640 --> 03:27:15.750 align:start position:0%
run the elections on the ground and i
simply

03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
simply
 
03:27:17.590 --> 03:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
texted them and i said how do you feel
 
03:27:19.110 --> 03:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
about before the people out
 
03:27:22.229 --> 03:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
they oppose it using some language
 
03:27:24.150 --> 03:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
some of it was a little spicy i'll just
 
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
say this they think that space
 
03:27:39.750 --> 03:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me we i really can't hear i can
 
03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
hardly hear
 
03:27:49.990 --> 03:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative pruden o'brien and i i
 
03:27:53.349 --> 03:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:56.229 --> 03:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
can you hear me better now the
 
03:27:57.429 --> 03:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
microphone has moved
 
03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you anyway i'm speaking in favor
 
03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
03:28:04.950 --> 03:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
and for the reason why i'm in favor of
 
03:28:06.950 --> 03:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment and why it's needed
 
03:28:09.269 --> 03:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
in in order to address that i really
 
03:28:10.309 --> 03:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
need to speak about
 
03:28:13.910 --> 03:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
hr1 and s1
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
i find it deeply troubling that
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
our federal delegation has been
 
03:28:25.510 --> 03:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
silent with their response
 
03:28:27.910 --> 03:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the lack of response is is
 
03:28:27.920 --> 03:28:29.030 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the lack of response is is
deafening

03:28:29.030 --> 03:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
deafening
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
um new hampshire house hasn't had
 
03:28:36.389 --> 03:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
any conversation with them
 
03:28:38.469 --> 03:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
has any conversation with them we heard
 
03:28:39.830 --> 03:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
testimony today that the municipal
 
03:28:41.670 --> 03:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
association has not heard from them
 
03:28:43.269 --> 03:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
they're they're already interested as
 
03:28:45.510 --> 03:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office has not
 
03:28:48.309 --> 03:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
and we heard testimony from them passed
 
03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
on this
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
how they very much oppose that
 
03:28:52.000 --> 03:28:54.630 align:start position:0%
how they very much oppose that
legislation

03:28:54.630 --> 03:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:28:58.150 --> 03:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
again h.r 1 and s1
 
03:29:00.309 --> 03:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
are in direct conflict with the new
 
03:29:02.150 --> 03:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution
 
03:29:05.429 --> 03:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
we got to reaching out i did contact
 
03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
my uh senators and
 
03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
my house member and i have not got a
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
response back
 
03:29:16.309 --> 03:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
maybe i will but i have not at this
 
03:29:18.229 --> 03:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
point so i have been proactive as a
 
03:29:18.239 --> 03:29:18.790 align:start position:0%
point so i have been proactive as a
citizen

03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
i did that so
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
in light of the total lack of
 
03:29:27.269 --> 03:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
responsiveness on our federal delegation
 
03:29:29.510 --> 03:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
to address some serious concerns with
 
03:29:30.389 --> 03:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
03:29:31.830 --> 03:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
again not all of it's bad but there's
 
03:29:34.070 --> 03:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
many pieces that are troubling there's
 
03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
pieces of it again that violate the
 
03:29:35.600 --> 03:29:36.790 align:start position:0%
pieces of it again that violate the
constitution

03:29:36.790 --> 03:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
03:29:40.309 --> 03:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
and we heard testimony today that um
 
03:29:42.550 --> 03:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we did it we did it right
 
03:29:43.830 --> 03:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
03:29:44.950 --> 03:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need the federal
 
03:29:46.710 --> 03:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
government coming in and dictating the
 
03:29:46.720 --> 03:29:47.590 align:start position:0%
government coming in and dictating the
micromanaging

03:29:47.590 --> 03:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
micromanaging
 
03:29:50.710 --> 03:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
every little bit and piece of how we run
 
03:29:51.990 --> 03:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
our election
 
03:29:53.750 --> 03:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i will be
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:02.229 --> 03:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair
 
03:30:04.469 --> 03:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
the u.s constitution specifically
 
03:30:06.309 --> 03:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
assigns the responsibility for
 
03:30:08.710 --> 03:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
establishing election procedures
 
03:30:12.710 --> 03:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
to state legislatures
 
03:30:15.990 --> 03:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
this is about this whole bill
 
03:30:19.030 --> 03:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
s1 is about election procedures the
 
03:30:21.190 --> 03:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
constitution does not say the federal
 
03:30:24.389 --> 03:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
legislature has that responsibility
 
03:30:26.710 --> 03:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
does not say the courts have that
 
03:30:29.670 --> 03:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility nor the attorneys general
 
03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
and our state constitution also speaks
 
03:30:36.550 --> 03:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
to the to our responsibility as a
 
03:30:36.560 --> 03:30:37.910 align:start position:0%
to the to our responsibility as a
legislature

03:30:37.910 --> 03:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
to establish the procedures for
 
03:30:43.389 --> 03:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
elections and for that reason i will
 
03:30:47.110 --> 03:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically support this amendment
 
03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative senator did you
 
03:30:54.070 --> 03:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:09.429 --> 03:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
this was not intended on my part and i
 
03:31:14.389 --> 03:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
will say this because it was raised a
 
03:31:17.349 --> 03:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
couple of times as a poison pill
 
03:31:19.349 --> 03:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
to be honest those of you i would hope
 
03:31:21.670 --> 03:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know me have not seen me do such a
 
03:31:21.680 --> 03:31:24.630 align:start position:0%
you know me have not seen me do such a
thing

03:31:24.630 --> 03:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:27.190 --> 03:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me excuse me madam chair could
 
03:31:27.750 --> 03:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
you speak
 
03:31:30.870 --> 03:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
into a microphone
 
03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
i thought we had somebody down here for
 
03:31:33.910 --> 03:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
my team that cleared this stuff up but
 
03:31:35.110 --> 03:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
apparently not
 
03:31:37.349 --> 03:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
um this was not intended as a poison
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
pill by any means
 
03:31:42.150 --> 03:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
but um done by me in light of what has
 
03:31:42.160 --> 03:31:43.030 align:start position:0%
but um done by me in light of what has
occurred

03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
03:31:45.670 --> 03:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
um you we can talk about contacting our
 
03:31:47.269 --> 03:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
representatives to make a change in the
 
03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
bill but the
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
reality at the federal level this bill
 
03:31:51.990 --> 03:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
deals with three things
 
03:31:55.190 --> 03:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
three distinct parts as i said in my
 
03:31:57.190 --> 03:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
testimony introducing the bill it deals
 
03:31:57.200 --> 03:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
testimony introducing the bill it deals
with

03:31:57.590 --> 03:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:32:00.710 --> 03:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
voting it deals with campaign
 
03:32:03.750 --> 03:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
finance and it deals with ethics and
 
03:32:05.830 --> 03:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
election security is also part of the
 
03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
bill part
 
03:32:10.710 --> 03:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
one of the bill could easily be taken
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
out of the bill
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
if parties want if individuals want to
 
03:32:18.070 --> 03:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
go on about dark money and campaigns
 
03:32:19.670 --> 03:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
and getting it out which i find it
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
interesting from our
 
03:32:23.269 --> 03:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
sitting senator who has recently
 
03:32:25.190 --> 03:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
commented on it having received
 
03:32:27.670 --> 03:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
the most money from out of state in any
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
senate election in history
 
03:32:33.429 --> 03:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
that's fine i did not purposely comment
 
03:32:35.110 --> 03:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
on those aspects because i think there
 
03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
is some history that clearly indicates
 
03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
things like the loss
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
um the pain
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
finance act have already been in place
 
03:32:45.750 --> 03:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
in regards to federal financing of
 
03:32:45.760 --> 03:32:46.389 align:start position:0%
in regards to federal financing of
elections

03:32:46.389 --> 03:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
elections
 
03:32:48.870 --> 03:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
and we don't have a lot of estate level
 
03:32:50.550 --> 03:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
to do with that
 
03:32:52.469 --> 03:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
this was brought forward because this
 
03:32:53.910 --> 03:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill is making its way
 
03:32:55.670 --> 03:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
through the house and senate in
 
03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
washington it made it through the house
 
03:32:59.190 --> 03:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
without any changes
 
03:33:01.190 --> 03:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
and the senate in a committee meeting
 
03:33:03.269 --> 03:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
had a number of amendments proposed to
 
03:33:03.279 --> 03:33:03.590 align:start position:0%
had a number of amendments proposed to
it

03:33:03.590 --> 03:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:33:06.950 --> 03:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
none of which were adopted now i heard
 
03:33:08.870 --> 03:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning that there might
 
03:33:08.880 --> 03:33:09.190 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning that there might
be

03:33:09.190 --> 03:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:33:11.990 --> 03:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
some changes for example to exempt
 
03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
polling places of less than 3 000
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really help new hampshire
 
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
it may help places like la
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
la county has 10.3 million people
 
03:33:30.389 --> 03:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
and i point that out because
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
the reality is new hampshire conducts
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
its elections substantially different
 
03:33:37.990 --> 03:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
than the rest of the country
 
03:33:39.830 --> 03:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
one of our representatives routinely
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
says new hampshire is either first or
 
03:33:44.309 --> 03:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
last in everything well new hampshire is
 
03:33:46.469 --> 03:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
sort of unique in that we maintain
 
03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
the new england uh traditions of town
 
03:33:51.030 --> 03:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
meetings and we have a constitution that
 
03:33:52.710 --> 03:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
i believe was established five or six
 
03:33:55.030 --> 03:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
years before the federal constitution
 
03:33:58.870 --> 03:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
we do not vote by county the majority of
 
03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country votes by county
 
03:34:04.870 --> 03:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
which why makes it makes provisions of
 
03:34:04.880 --> 03:34:05.910 align:start position:0%
which why makes it makes provisions of
s-1

03:34:05.910 --> 03:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
s-1
 
03:34:08.309 --> 03:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
as to making sure there are drop boxes
 
03:34:09.110 --> 03:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
in rural
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
areas that are accessible tell me how do
 
03:34:14.309 --> 03:34:14.319 align:start position:0%
we resolve that provision in colossae
 
03:34:14.319 --> 03:34:16.150 align:start position:0%
we resolve that provision in colossae
county

03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
county
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
um queens new york is 2.2 million
 
03:34:22.469 --> 03:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
i bring up those two counties because
 
03:34:24.550 --> 03:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
those are of course counties and states
 
03:34:26.710 --> 03:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
of nancy pelosi and chuck schumer
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
who are big proponents of this bill and
 
03:34:32.070 --> 03:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
i would just say that we do not
 
03:34:35.429 --> 03:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
do things like other states and to ask
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to somehow chip away to
 
03:34:40.389 --> 03:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
continue how we do things in the face of
 
03:34:41.990 --> 03:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
county and states
 
03:34:44.790 --> 03:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
with those kind of numbers it's simply
 
03:34:44.800 --> 03:34:45.110 align:start position:0%
with those kind of numbers it's simply
not

03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:34:48.070 --> 03:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
realistic this is not intended for grant
 
03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
standing this is intended to allow our
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
communities to continue to conduct
 
03:34:51.840 --> 03:34:52.870 align:start position:0%
communities to continue to conduct
elections

03:34:52.870 --> 03:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
elections
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
in a manner that they have done so i
 
03:34:56.469 --> 03:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
don't take
 
03:34:59.830 --> 03:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
opening shots it's not my style
 
03:35:02.870 --> 03:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
and it's not intended to be before it is
 
03:35:04.870 --> 03:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
a recognition of the reality of what is
 
03:35:05.670 --> 03:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:35:07.830 --> 03:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
in what unfortunately is becoming a more
 
03:35:07.840 --> 03:35:08.790 align:start position:0%
in what unfortunately is becoming a more
partisan

03:35:08.790 --> 03:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
03:35:11.110 --> 03:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
arena if people were truly interested in
 
03:35:13.030 --> 03:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
the campaign finance piece
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
and truly interested in the ethics piece
 
03:35:17.429 --> 03:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
they'd be agreeing that part one
 
03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill should simply be deleted so
 
03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
my bill is intended to make sure that
 
03:35:22.950 --> 03:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's deleted
 
03:35:25.830 --> 03:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
as to new hampshire and i want to thank
 
03:35:26.950 --> 03:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
the committee members for
 
03:35:29.429 --> 03:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
indulgence i usually try to avoid
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
bringing forward those
 
03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
amendments but here we are thank you
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
and representative thank you mr chairman
 
03:35:37.840 --> 03:35:38.630 align:start position:0%
and representative thank you mr chairman
uh

03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:40.870 --> 03:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes we do do things differently in new
 
03:35:42.070 --> 03:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire and yes
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
the federal legislation as with issues
 
03:35:46.950 --> 03:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
in any state
 
03:35:49.269 --> 03:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
should be examined to see if there are
 
03:35:51.030 --> 03:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
any adjustments that can be made and
 
03:35:53.349 --> 03:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
we've had testimony that the
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
adjustments are being looked at at this
 
03:35:56.550 --> 03:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
point i
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
i would point out that there's been much
 
03:36:00.389 --> 03:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
more attention
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
in the case of the majority party
 
03:36:08.070 --> 03:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
to um certain democratic
 
03:36:11.349 --> 03:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
political people holding power at this
 
03:36:12.870 --> 03:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
moment in washington
 
03:36:15.910 --> 03:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
then there has been to the legal aspects
 
03:36:16.469 --> 03:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
of what
 
03:36:18.389 --> 03:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to do which is very
 
03:36:21.190 --> 03:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
simply to violate the supremacy clause
 
03:36:23.910 --> 03:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
of the united states constitution
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
you haven't heard anybody talking about
 
03:36:28.150 --> 03:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
that because
 
03:36:30.790 --> 03:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
i assume they they know that the choices
 
03:36:30.800 --> 03:36:31.349 align:start position:0%
i assume they they know that the choices
are

03:36:31.349 --> 03:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
either violated or have two separate
 
03:36:36.070 --> 03:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
systems which they have no ability to
 
03:36:36.080 --> 03:36:36.870 align:start position:0%
systems which they have no ability to
determine

03:36:36.870 --> 03:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
determine
 
03:36:39.429 --> 03:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
how much it will cost how long it will
 
03:36:39.439 --> 03:36:39.910 align:start position:0%
how much it will cost how long it will
take

03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
but they would rather once again and i'm
 
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
not referring to any individual but
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
people can make their own judgments
 
03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
about the
 
03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
amount of attention that certain
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
individuals and personalities have taken
 
03:36:53.349 --> 03:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
up in this hearing
 
03:36:55.349 --> 03:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
and so once again i will oppose that
 
03:36:57.030 --> 03:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you mr chairman
 
03:36:59.750 --> 03:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any other
 
03:37:00.830 --> 03:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
discussion on this
 
03:37:00.840 --> 03:37:06.070 align:start position:0%
discussion on this
um

03:37:06.070 --> 03:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.190 --> 03:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i would just respond
 
03:37:11.190 --> 03:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
that the supremacy clause of the u.s
 
03:37:11.200 --> 03:37:12.469 align:start position:0%
that the supremacy clause of the u.s
constitution

03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
03:37:14.550 --> 03:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
does not allow the federal legislature
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
to violate the u.s constitution
 
03:37:18.870 --> 03:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what we'll be doing in this
 
03:37:18.880 --> 03:37:20.389 align:start position:0%
and that's what we'll be doing in this
case

03:37:20.389 --> 03:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
i have a question for representative
 
03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%

03:37:24.800 --> 03:37:25.130 align:start position:0%

well
[Music]

03:37:28.389 --> 03:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:32.469 --> 03:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
senator cody uh yes mr chairman
 
03:37:36.070 --> 03:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative oh thank you
 
03:37:39.990 --> 03:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh did uh do you believe that the uh
 
03:37:43.510 --> 03:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
congress united states violated
 
03:37:45.510 --> 03:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
the supremacy clause when it passed the
 
03:37:49.510 --> 03:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
voting rights act of 1965
 
03:37:51.910 --> 03:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
the voting rights act was a civil rights
 
03:37:53.349 --> 03:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
act that dealt with
 
03:37:56.309 --> 03:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
excluding people from voting this is a
 
03:37:58.469 --> 03:37:58.479 align:start position:0%
process that is telling states how to
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
run their
 
03:38:01.190 --> 03:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
elections and i realized that there are
 
03:38:03.110 --> 03:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
some crossovers between the two
 
03:38:04.950 --> 03:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
but i think there is a distinctly
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
different aspect to those two bills
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
i guess that's what we'll find out but

03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
that do want to make sure new hampshire
 
03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
is writing new hampshire's election laws
 
03:39:08.950 --> 03:39:08.960 align:start position:0%

03:39:08.960 --> 03:39:09.910 align:start position:0%
and i hope our federal delegation is
listening

03:39:09.910 --> 03:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
