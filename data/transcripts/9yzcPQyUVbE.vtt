you so um just to to uh kind of give a a
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
bit of a road map of um what we're going
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
to do and how we're going to uh proceed
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
today um we're going to first have a
 
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
discussion without uh as part of the
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
work session of the various bills that
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh retain bills that we have uh before
 
00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
us um and then
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
um based upon that discussion when it
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
when we get to 11 o'clock which is what
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
the the the notice uh of this session
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
indicates as a time for the executive
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
session if there are bills on which it
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
appears that the committee has achieved
 
00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:33.070 align:start position:0%
appears that the committee has achieved
a

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
consensus um uh I will call for uh votes
 
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
on those um on those bills um however I
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
I anticipate that there will be at least
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
a couple of bills upon which either we
 
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
will not have achieved consensus or that
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
that there is additional work to be done
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
um uh and on those bills we will not uh
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
we will not take a vote today but we'll
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
uh we'll Reserve those for next
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um so with that I guess I'd
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
like to open the discussion with uh with
 
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
regard to House Bill
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
149 this was a
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
bill um dealing with the right to no law
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
and it basically
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
required that there be if if information
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
was requested of a covered let's say
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
municipality and could not be provided
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
um either within the original 5 days or
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
even within 30 days then this would have
 
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
required periodic reporting by the
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
municipality about the progress of you
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
know where they were how where where is
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
the information that's been requested
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
and why haven't you gotten it and what's
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
the what's the uh prognosis so to speak
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
for how long how much longer it'll take
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
you our
 
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.470 align:start position:0%
you our
um

00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.110 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
discussion of this bill back in the the
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
last time that we
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
met um as a full committee this this was
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
not the subject of uh of uh any
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but our discussion the last
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
time we met was that um we we didn't
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
think that this our inclination was that
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
this bill should be
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
ited um and I um agreed that I would
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
speak one of the one of the reasons that
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
was offered in support of that which
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
made a lot of sense was that we have
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
just we've just created a new uh right
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
to know on budsman um and that he's sort
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
of just basically up and running and so
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
it would make sense if if we were going
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
to do anything on something like this it
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
would make sense not to do it right now
 
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
I promised uh in that discussion that I
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
would call the right to no on budsman
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I have to confess to you that I that
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
sort of over the summer that kind of
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
completely skipped my mind until I
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
looked at the notes of what I was
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to do a couple of days ago and
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
then I quickly called him and spoke to
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
him and said told him what what our
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
inclination was and asked him if he
 
00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
thought that there was any particular
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
need to move forward with 159 now his
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
response was that he did not so I think
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
despite my uh my tardiness and being
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
communicating with him I think is is you
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
know the information that he gave me was
 
00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
kind of consistent with what I think the
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
committee sort of thought in the first
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
place so my inclination on this would be
 
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
again I'm not calling for a vote but my
 
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
inclination would be that we that this
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
bill should be it and if other people
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
have a different view um discussion yeah
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:00.909 align:start position:0%
 
on

00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
that is uh House Bill
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
283 uh which is to uh uh as originally
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
drafted to limit application fees charge
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
to prospective residential tenants um
 
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
and there was a subcommittee on that I
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
believe representative Alexander you uh
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
you were the chair of that subcommittee
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I'll turn it over to
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair um so our
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meant met it was uh myself
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative D Lorenzo representative
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
Horgan and representative Kenny um and
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
we came to an agreement in the
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um so that
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
agreement was amendment that is front of
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
you amendment number
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
233h um the one thing that was kind of
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
up in the air and we were trying to get
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
guidance from OS was regarding the
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
penalties components so that sparked um
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
two more amendments to be drafted
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill um these two
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
amendments are
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
2432h and
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%

representative Reed are on one and
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
myself on the other um the basic
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
difference between these two amendments
 
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.269 align:start position:0%
difference between these two amendments
is

00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%

00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
um it's basically
 
00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:16.590 align:start position:0%
um it's basically
2303

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
2303
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
replicated um on representative re and
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
Kenny's Amendment on line 14 to a
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
landlord who charges running a
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
background or credit check shall provide
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
written results of the check to the app
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
of such check to the applicant that was
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
in some language that we agreed to in
 
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee and then um the end of
 
00:23:38.909 --> 00:23:38.919 align:start position:0%
the section lines 19 beyond that is the
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh penalties section which was a
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
disagreement um notwithstanding
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
provisions of sub paragraph a a landlord
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
who violates RSA shall be subject to an
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
award of the applicant's actual damage
 
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
costs and attorney's fees plus $100 my
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment does not have that language my
 
00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment just basically says that a
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
landlord who violates RSA this section
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
shall be subject only to returning the
 
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
applicant all monies provided by the
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
applicant as part of their application
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
that so that's all used and unused um
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
money so I I called the courts and I
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
asked them um how expensive it is to
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
file one of these petitions it's called
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
a 540A um they said there's no cost to
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
the tenant to file this so um it's my
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
view and there may be some disagreement
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to add court costs or
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
um actual damages or anything and just
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
the simple returning of the fee um to me
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
is adequate I I think what this bill
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
sought to do was
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
address scamming address when landlords
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
would charge application fees or or
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
housing providers charge application
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
fees and those application fees and they
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
would never rent the unit out they would
 
00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:52.039 align:start position:0%
just continue to charge those fees um so
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
you think you know if you go on
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
Craigslist and you look on Craigslist
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
and there's a unit for rent and then you
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
pay the application fee and then you
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
never hear anything else like this
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
amendment and the agreement that we had
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee which is a great
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
agreement um would address that and I
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
think it is really needed and I strongly
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
believe the final language should
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
include um the language that's from both
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
of these amendments um like I said I'm
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
happy to defer to my other colleagues
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
but the disagreement came um around the
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
penalties section so uh with that I'm
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
just going to leave it up to the
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee to discuss that thank you Mr
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
chair other um other comments
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you Mr chairman um so I
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
agree with everything that
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander said until he
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh got to the penalties um I think these
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
are very modest penalties that act as a
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
disincentive um you know for bad faith
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
practices in the future of um actual
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
damages plus
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
$100 um to be honest that wasn't ideal
 
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
on our side either but I believe that
 
00:25:59.350 --> 00:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
that is a fair compromise between what
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
both sides wanted um to make this bill
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
better um so that and then yes the other
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
difference was from line 14 to 16 um
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
which regards that um if a background
 
00:26:15.549 --> 00:26:15.559 align:start position:0%
check or credit check is ran that the
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
results um shall be the written results
 
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
should be um given to the applicant
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
which I think is just fair transparency
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
so I do believe that out of the
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
Amendments um and the work the
 
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee did uh 2
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
432h would be the strongest um and
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
fairest of the three amendments thank
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Perez thank you
 
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my comment I don't think the
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
$100 is enforceable so I don't think it
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
should be there um so I'm a landlord and
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
I don't rent it and I'm going to give
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
him back his money and you say well you
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
$100 what are you going to do take me to
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
court for the
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
$100 I just think it's not necessary so
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
thought yes representative
 
00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
Andrews you thank you Mr chair my
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
question is what percent of fees charged
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
scammers that's a that's a great
 
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
question representative Andrew so during
 
00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:27.799 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee we heard some testimony
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
um I I'll admit anecdotally that this is
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
happening on a widespread issue I I
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this is happening as
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
widespread as some may testify to
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
believe but if it were to be happening
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we came up with in
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee would handle that um
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
so I encourage you to support one of
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
those two amendments I think the big
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
disagreement is the penalty
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:59.149 align:start position:0%
disagreement is the penalty
section

00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:27:59.159 --> 00:28:00.389 align:start position:0%
section
representative

00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
CH oh yeah this is um perhaps a question
 
00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:05.799 align:start position:0%
uh maybe to representative Alexander the
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
I see the difference between the two
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
sort of competing versions of the
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
amendment one of them speaks to um uh
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
damages uh costs and attorney's fees as
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
well as the $100 so it's more than just
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
the $100 difference um you referenced
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
sort of a a inexpensive process I wasn't
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
sure what that was and like what is the
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
likelihood of there being uh attorney
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
fees and other costs and what would
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
those be so that's a great question so
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the court uh a tenant is
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to file what is called a 548
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
petition I just called the court uh
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
representative gab was in the room um
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
that petition could be filed it's
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
considered a priority with the court um
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
and the Tenant can represent themselves
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
prosay so it's zero cost to them to file
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
it so I mean the amendment
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
2432 with damages costs and attorney's
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
fees there there wouldn't be any cost
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
inor attorney's fees because they would
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:08.919 align:start position:0%
540A representative Oregan um yes so I'm
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
willing to support uh one of these two
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
uh two amendments as a compromise but in
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
principle it kind of bothers me charging
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
um charging application fees to the
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
applicants although um there there may
 
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
be uh certainly a nominal fee is
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
probably harmless and this is more to
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
actual costs but we heard a lot about
 
00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
how the landlords are entitled to the
 
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
cost of the time and effort they put
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
into uh put into making the background
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
checks which is uh which is true and
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
obviously no landlords like anybody
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else's in business they're not
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
going to stay in business very long if
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
their uh revenues don't cover their cost
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
but I think this particular cost should
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
be uh should be born by the landlords
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
and of course they'll pass it on to the
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
tenants I'm not really really sure it
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
seems a little unfair to make these
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
applicants pay pay for it um because you
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
know they're not gaining any benefit
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
from the background check especially if
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
they don't get the uh apartment so it
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
should be um you know this this like any
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
other overhead should be mostly paid for
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
out of the uh out of the rental income
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
and I know rents are very high and the
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
costs are very high but that's not the
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
primary driver of the high rents or even
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
um or even that's not the primary driver
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
of the high rents is mostly that there's
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
like a shortage of supply and an excess
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
of demand and I guess that probably will
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
correct itself with some of the new
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
inventory coming into the market but so
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
I uh I certainly I'm certainly happy to
 
00:30:41.509 --> 00:30:41.519 align:start position:0%
compromise on uh one of these one of
 
00:30:43.389 --> 00:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
these two amendments especially the uh
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
Kenny Amendment so
 
00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:46.830 align:start position:0%
Kenny Amendment so
thanks

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah so it's my understanding
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
that there is a $126 filing fee for
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
non-emergencies um so I guess I'll put
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
it out there as a question is my
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chair so my question
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
is which I'm trying to get straight in
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
my mind is this bill trying to penalize
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
the scammers and if it is why are we
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
trying are we trying to scam I are we
 
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
landlords representative Smith did you
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
have a comment I just wasn't clear on
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny's
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
Point what you know as I understood his
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
point and I I you know I haven't looked
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
at this recently but I think he's right
 
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
is that the the court would if something
 
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
is an emergency and usually that arises
 
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the situation of a tenant that comes
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
in says you know that the landlord is
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
trying to evict me like today or or next
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
week or something like that and I need
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
to act need to act I need the Court's
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
relief quickly the court would would
 
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
likely not always but likely wave the
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
filing fee but if it's if it's not that
 
00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:16.519 align:start position:0%
and I would think that in some at least
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
in most cases it would seem to me if
 
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
you're if what you're talking about is
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
getting back an application fee well I
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
suppose if the if the if the tenant was
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
saying I need this money to to make a
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
new to pay the net rent at a new place
 
00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
or make a new application maybe that
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
would be considered an emergency but
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
there could be situations when it
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be um and therefore you would
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
have to pay the filing fee could um
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
representative kutab I think you had
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
suggested that that there might be yet
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
another option um that would that would
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
basically if I understood what you were
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
saying it would take Al representative
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
Alexander's amendment to uh
 
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
2433 and in
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph in section two paragraph F
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
would simp would add to the words shall
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
be subject only to returning to the
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
applicant all monies provided by the
 
00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
applicant as part of their application
 
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
plus court costs is that was that
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
correct yes I haven't filed that yet
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
compromise so anybody else have yes
 
00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
representative gon thank you Mr chair I
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
like excuse me I like what has been
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
inserted into Amendment 2432h the
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
statement of lines 14- 16 the landlord
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
who charges for a background check Andor
 
00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
credit check shall provide the written
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
results of the check to the applicant uh
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
that may seem like a burden to the
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
landlord to do that however it also
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
holds the the landlord accountable that
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
they are actually running the check as
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
they are stating that they will excuse
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
me that they will so I actually like
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
that part as far as penalty goes and we
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
could debate this all day long and if
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
without a without some form of penalty
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
uh then the law is irrelevant and so
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
whatever we decide on is a penalty we
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
want to lock them up in jail for the
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives whatever you know um
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
joke but um I don't think we need to
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
wait until scamming becomes more
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
prevalent before we act and so if
 
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
there's anecdotal evidence that
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
something is taking place it's probably
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
happening more frequently than we would
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
like to believe and we you know by
 
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
taking some kind of an action now I
 
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
think we can prevent more of it from
 
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
happening uh those who've been landlords
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for a longer period of
 
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:55.079 align:start position:0%
time I don't believe it's a problem it's
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
the ones who are becoming new landlords
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
perhap perhaps moving in here from other
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
places uh where that perhaps was much
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
more culturally acceptable uh and so I
 
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
think we need to protect New Hampshire
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh by taking action now so I like the
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
idea of taking the statement out of two
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
two uh 2432 melting it with 2433 and
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
then if we need to add the statement
 
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
like as representative cab suggested
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
plus court costs as a penalty then that
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
would be something I think I could
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
easily vote
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.990 align:start position:0%
easily vote
for

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to clarify so were you
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
saying that basically to the amendment
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Alexander made that
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
you would just add to the bottom of
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph one
 
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.710 align:start position:0%
paragraph one
that

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
um that they could get a copy of the
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
report and
 
00:35:51.069 --> 00:35:51.079 align:start position:0%
then um add in that and court cost to
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
the end of the section two it would be
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
the verbage of all of paragraph one
 
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
because they're they're they're exactly
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
the same except for the one statement M
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
so take that verbiage and then your
 
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion of plus court costs on uh
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
plugged in at the end of amendment 2433
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
what the verbiage in the penalty phase
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
there plus court costs I think that
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
would be I think that would work okay
 
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.790 align:start position:0%
would be I think that would work okay
thank

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
you representative chair thank you Mr
 
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
chair um one thing I just wanted to
 
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
point out or or ask about the um the
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
2433 Amendment it says return all monies
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
provided by the applicant so is it your
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
intent with that to say that the penalty
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
if there's a penalty is they don't get
 
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
to keep the actual costs that that they
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
would in the first part of the provision
 
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
okay so so there so there is a small
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
amount of a penalty sort of built into
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
your language yes so it's the cost of
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
the credit check background check uh
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.470 align:start position:0%
the credit check background check uh
reasonable

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
documented fees all that stuff so they'd
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
be forfeiting that they'd be forfeiting
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
all the money yes okay and I I I do like
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative Cab's addition because I
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
think it clears up this discrepancy
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
depending on whether it's an emergency
 
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
emergency so
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
I I I think that correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
um representative Lyn but isn't it
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
originally just the judge's discretion
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
on a lot of this stuff anyways so they
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
be allowed to return that yeah no they
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
there that's true it really is pretty
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
veryy largely discretionary um you know
 
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
what the the
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
I well first before I speak do I anybody
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
else have any any comments that they
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
want to make I seeing none so I I guess
 
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:46.839 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I agree with representative
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
Alexander and cutab and tur that um
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
adding the return of the costs to two
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
2433 is a would be a good idea and I
 
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
could support 2433 with that addition I
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
I don't frankly like 2432 because if
 
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
you're um when it talks about damages
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
costs and attorney's fees that I mean I
 
00:38:17.319 --> 00:38:18.190 align:start position:0%
costs and attorney's fees that I mean I
I

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
think to me what we I think we we need
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
to sort of go back maybe in some sense
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
to First principles and remember right
 
00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:29.079 align:start position:0%
now the law is that there are no we
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't regulate application fees at all
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
and um my inclination is that that one
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that this whole thing has
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
become an issue is because of the
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
housing market and I I I can't help
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
referring there was a there was an
 
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
article I think I don't know if it was
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
the union leader or the conquered
 
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:50.839 align:start position:0%
monitor or whatever but by
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative turot indicating that uh
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
that you know the the housing the the
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
situation in the housing market have uh
 
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
as it is has has caused a number of
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
issues and that that situation in the
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
housing market presumably won't last
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
forever and things may might change uh
 
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
when the housing market changes but I'm
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
concerned that allowing damages I mean
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
what you know if a if
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
a if someone if a tenant or a
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
prospective tenant claims that um
 
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
the landlord didn't uh charge too high
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
an application fee and I I was out I had
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
to I had to pay this money um and it and
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a reasonable fee and as a
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
result of that I couldn't afford to do
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
something else and suff suffered some
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
damage I couldn't afford to buy medicine
 
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
for my son or my daughter and I and and
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
as a result of that he or she was in I
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
mean is that you know is that some kind
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
of Damages that could be recover I'm I'm
 
00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that that it would be but
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
all I'm saying is it raises if you put
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
that language in you raise the the the
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
prospect that somebody including perhaps
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
um a lawyer a creative lawyer might say
 
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
well yes this is this is Damages that
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
flow from what you did and therefore I'm
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm suing you for three
 
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
million doll
 
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.870 align:start position:0%
million doll
um

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
that fortunately that kind of thing has
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
happened in the past in other areas and
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
it concerns me greatly um if we if we
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
allowed that um that language to stay in
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
there the the last point I would make is
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
and this is um with response to
 
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
representative grion the the language in
 
00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.829 align:start position:0%
representative grion the the language in
uh

00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
2432 that provides for the landlord to
 
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
give a copy of the background check and
 
00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
credit check to the applicant I guess I
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
do have some question about the wisdom
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
of that remembering
 
00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.589 align:start position:0%
of that remembering
that

00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:05.390 align:start position:0%
that
we're

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
we're right now we're talking about a
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
situation where there is no regulation
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
and this is going to Pro
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
provide if we pass some version of this
 
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
bill we're going to be passing some
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
restrictions on what a landlord can do
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
that as I understand it the way it works
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
now if a landlord decides to run a
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
record check or a credit check the
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
landlord gets that information back and
 
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
then makes a judgment on whether or not
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
based upon what he or she has seen um
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
the the person is the per they're going
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
to rent to the person um that judgment
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
is not maybe right or wrong but it's not
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
subject to sort of
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
review um I'm concerned that if you say
 
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
that the that this information gets
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
presented has to be presented to the to
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
the tenant or perspective tenant now
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to get in a situation where
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know the tenant sees the tenant sees
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
the credit check and it says your credit
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
score was this and the Tenant says to
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
the landlord no no no that's all wrong
 
00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
you can't uh you know don't don't base
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
it on
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
this my point is simply
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
that if you if you create the situation
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
where that kind of thing is likely to
 
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:31.559 align:start position:0%
happen it just puts another sort of risk
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
factor on prospective landlords and the
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
result of that risk factor and the
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
landlord saying to himself am I gonna
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
now have to you know am I now GNA have
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
to fight with this perspective tenant
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
about whether the the criminal
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
background check is correct or not or
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
the credit check is correct or not have
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
an argument with this guy about this um
 
00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
that's another sort of you know headache
 
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
for the landlord and as a result of
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
that rental prices will increase because
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
land because uh because it's another
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
hurdle placed in the in the way of the
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
landlord my suggestion would be at the
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
at least in the beginning don't do that
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
if it turns out that we you know we we
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
provide we adopt let's say amendment 2
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
2433 with the change for the recovering
 
00:43:29.309 --> 00:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
your costs and it turns out that you
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
know we really
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
see continuing problems with with uh
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
application fees then at some point in
 
00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
the future maybe we maybe we make that
 
00:43:38.599 --> 00:43:39.390 align:start position:0%
the future maybe we maybe we make that
other

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
change representative gon thank you Mr
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
chair when a person applies for a a
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
consumer credit loan now and if they are
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
denied that loan the the laws require
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
that the bank informed the the applicant
 
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
why they were denied uh it'll tell you
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
your credit score
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
and if there's any errors in it it's not
 
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the bank uh that you were
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
trying to borrow from to correct any
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
errors it's yours and so the the
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
landlord is only reviewing information
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
that was provided to them by some other
 
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
authority so if there's something in
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
your criminal check or your or your
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
credit check they're not responsible for
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
the content of it that's only what they
 
00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
are using so if there's an error in it
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
you have to fix it as the applicant uh
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
but providing a statement that says this
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
is why you were denied
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
based on what we have in the in this
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
report that's that's not a matter of of
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
discussion this the I I denied your
 
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
application because of this so we
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
already do that when it comes to
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
Consumer loans I don't see why we
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't do that for
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
this yes representative peret I have a
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
question just too because I don't
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
understand so I'm applying to rent a
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
house that you own representative Lynn
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
and do you tell me what your level of
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
credit check is required because I do
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
know they do that in North Carolina they
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
they do tell them you have to have at
 
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
least this much of a credit check so do
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
we tell them so what's to stop the
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
landlord from saying well you came in at
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
550 and I required
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
560 I I just don't I'm just asking a
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
question do they R tell people what they
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
require for a credit
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
rating I think or subject somebody
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong on it but I
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
think the answer at least right now is
 
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have to I mean they can but
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have to this I think under
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
under any of
 
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.030 align:start position:0%
under any of
the

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
um under
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
either yeah under either um
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
230 2432 or 2433 the landlord would now
 
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
have to say I'm gonna you know this is
 
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
um uh what would be required for a
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
satisfactory criminal background or
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
credit check okay representative
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you um Mr chair could you
 
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
help me know who's on
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
first I I'm I'm a little bit of a loss I
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
mean we've been here you know talking
 
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:16.559 align:start position:0%
about this for quite a while and I'm I'm
 
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
not I don't see the
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
forward motion that we need on on the
 
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:24.559 align:start position:0%
committee at the moment I understand we
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
have uh several amendments the one that
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
seems to be um on first base or maybe
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
second base since now you can start on
 
00:46:35.069 --> 00:46:35.079 align:start position:0%
second base in certain
 
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
22433 H with additional language that
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
would come on line 21 that says plus
 
00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.430 align:start position:0%
would come on line 21 that says plus
court

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
costs and is that the version that
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
um that the committee seems to favor or
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
do we need to see
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
a kind of a show of hands uh so that we
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're not going to bother OSS with doing
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
an amendment if in fact it's Amendment
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to be dead on arrival um
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
they don't need that nor do we um so I
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
just kind of want to get a sense of
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
where the committee is that's a very
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
very good point I I I think you it's
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
well taken um so I guess what I would
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
say is this um could I ask for an
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
informal show of hands around the table
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
of how many uh here would support
 
00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:38.069 align:start position:0%
of how many uh here would support
Amendment

00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:47:38.079 --> 00:47:40.190 align:start position:0%
Amendment
2023

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
2433 if on line 21 it added at the End
 
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
favorite let me then turn to let me turn
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
to uh the next question on how many here
 
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.190 align:start position:0%
to uh the next question on how many here
would

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
2432 and how many how many would not
 
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:30.790 align:start position:0%
2432 and how many how many would not
support

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:31.790 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.790 align:start position:0%
all
right

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
yes can we ask representative Alexander
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
why he would not support his Amendment
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
with adding Court
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
C thank you for putting me on the spot
 
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
um I I think that we should leave it up
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
to the judge to be able to do that I
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
think that the judge already has the
 
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
discretion to do it I think I actually
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
think adding those three words is kind
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
of nitpicking like what I mean we are
 
00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
going to leave I think strongly leave it
 
00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:01.559 align:start position:0%
up to the judge I think this is well
 
00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:03.559 align:start position:0%
formulated there is a penalty they have
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
to return the entire fee not just part
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
of the fee so um that's why I wouldn't
 
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.510 align:start position:0%
of the fee so um that's why I wouldn't
support

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
it okay all right yes can we see who
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
unofficially who would
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
support representative Alexander's um
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment without the court cost now
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
that he's explained his reasoning all
 
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
right no that's a good Fair yes
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
sure um so I'm going to put you on the
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
spot now chairman Lyn thank you for
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
letting me speak um where it says
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
subject only to returning I just want to
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
clarify in your
 
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
opinion would the judge have the
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
discretion to award the court cost if it
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't say it in
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
there well I I I think that's that's an
 
00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
open question I mean you could say that
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
this is um that court costs are sort of
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
different from even without the language
 
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
Court you know even if you didn't
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
include the language plus court
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
cost it could be argued that even though
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
the word only appears in subsection
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
f it what's referred to there is
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
different than court costs so that court
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
costs could still be allowed but the
 
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
word only is a you know that's that's
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's arguable that's you know and and
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
some lawyers you know lawyers can make
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
arguments on that and uh and will so it
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to ensure that
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
court costs come back I my advice would
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
be to add the language Court Cost Plus
 
00:50:44.799 --> 00:50:48.910 align:start position:0%
be to add the language Court Cost Plus
court

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
cost Mr chair could we accomplish the
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
same goal by removing the word
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
only I think we probably could I think
 
00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.630 align:start position:0%
only I think we probably could I think
we

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:04.839 align:start position:0%
could I'm I'm fine we fine with that
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
too so let me ask
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
this let me ask this question straw vote
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
suppose on in line subsection F on
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2433 we remov the word only
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
but otherwise left that as as it is who
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
can I ask you to show of hands who would
 
00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.349 align:start position:0%
can I ask you to show of hands who would
support

00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:31.190 align:start position:0%
support
that

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
that all
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
right yes did you I have a question sure
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead please I'm I'm just wondering I
 
00:51:46.789 --> 00:51:46.799 align:start position:0%
I think the American Judicial System
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
usually has that both parties pay their
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
own fees unless it's specifically U
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
stated otherwise can you think of
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
another statute where attorney's fee and
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
or cost court cost are regularly ordered
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
when it's not specifically authorized by
 
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:04.799 align:start position:0%
Statute well I think the problem here is
 
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
this is a this this is you know the the
 
00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.510 align:start position:0%
this is a this this is you know the the
reference

00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
reference
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
um in in
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.349 align:start position:0%
uh to
subsection

00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
subsection
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
the this whole area 540 is makes
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
reference generally to the consumer
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
protection act and specifically where
 
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
this talks about a
 
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
violation um I I think that might be
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
diff a different situation um that that
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
um uh you know that there that somebody
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
has violated a consumer protection kind
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
of Statute and despite the fact that it
 
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
says notwithstanding sub paragraph a
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
subar paragraph
 
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
a my inclination would be that that that
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
you know that would be the kind of
 
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
situation where a court would be would
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
be inclined to Grant return of uh of
 
00:53:00.079 --> 00:53:01.230 align:start position:0%
be inclined to Grant return of uh of
court

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
costs but if you're saying you know
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely is that true I can't you know
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know what a judge would do in
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.789 align:start position:0%
 
case

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:12.799 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
yes the reason that I felt without that
 
00:53:18.349 --> 00:53:18.359 align:start position:0%
it's not um as easily supportable is
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
that my understanding from the
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
discussion is that you could be subject
 
00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.309 align:start position:0%
discussion is that you could be subject
to

00:53:23.309 --> 00:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
$125 I think fee for filing this this
 
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
petition you know at that point it
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
becomes completely honorous if you're
 
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
not assured that if you win you're not
 
00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:35.559 align:start position:0%
going to get that back it feels as
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
though you're you're being subject
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
potentially if it's not an emergency
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
which I would imagine many of these
 
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be you know the the the
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
potential of not getting your court
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
feedback could outweigh the benefit of
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
dispute yes representative I I just want
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
to put this in perspective Ive I think
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
if there's a situation where a landlord
 
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
is clearly violating this
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
provision the judge I would hope would
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
award these court costs back um it it
 
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:10.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost anything other than $126
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
the tenant should be able to or the
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
applicant should be able to represent
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
themselves so I I trust our Judicial
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
System enough to know that in this
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
situation if there's something that
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
egregious where this is happening on a
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
regular and widespread effort which
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
again I'm not even convinced that that's
 
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
happening that this would be an adequate
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
way they the judge could award these
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
fees even with this language the way it
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
is here's just kind of what
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton we haven't
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
heard from you yet please sorry to
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
additionally be labor this but
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
um landlord violates 54
 
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
A3 and the applicant takes exception he
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
gets a lawyer and they file a a
 
00:54:58.750 --> 00:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
petition uh wouldn't wouldn't a lawyer
 
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
reasonably uh put in that petition
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
request for compensatory recovery of
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
court costs and maybe other extraneous
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
expenses uh you know I don't care if
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's taxi cab or because the person
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
can't drive or or whatever
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
um I feel that we're stepping on
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
existing jurist Prudence by adding these
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
little tidbits here court cost and $100
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
when an capable attorney could put these
 
00:55:31.789 --> 00:55:31.799 align:start position:0%
things in his petition am I right or
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
wrong on
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
that well I I mean I think you're right
 
00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
that they could put it in the petition
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
the question is whether you know in the
 
00:55:43.789 --> 00:55:43.799 align:start position:0%
absence of of some language allowing for
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
the recovery whether the court could
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
award that um and that's that's I mean
 
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
that's the question and I
 
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
think I think it pro the court probably
 
00:55:56.029 --> 00:55:56.039 align:start position:0%
would have the discretion to do that but
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
you know if you um if you want to ensure
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
that that that it happens that court
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
costs are returned in this situation
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
then I to me the safest way to do that
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
would be to just add the language court
 
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
U oh here's um here's what since we're
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
not going to be voting on this yet and
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
we have some other things to discuss to
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
discuss here's what I would suggest
 
00:56:22.829 --> 00:56:22.839 align:start position:0%
since it seems like there is not a
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
particular consensus on any of these um
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
but maybe we can it it comes closest to
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
consensus by having a version yet
 
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
another amendment of to
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
2433 which would
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
add to subsection F the words plus court
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
costs at the end and so I wonder if I
 
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
could ask our uh uh assistant if you
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
could ask OS to prepare that as another
 
00:56:59.950 --> 00:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be the only change
 
00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.309 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be the only change
to

00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
2433 to 2433 it would add at the end of
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
subsection F uh as part of the
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
application plus court
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
costs Mr chair are you are you asking
 
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
that um OLS be asked to do that right
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
now so that we might in fact be able to
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
vote on it later this morning yes yes
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay all right and hopefully I mean
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully we could do it today if it
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
turns out we can't then
 
00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
um great thank
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
you next I guess I would like to
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
um turn to uh House Bill
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
362 relative to complaint procedures and
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
cases before the commission for human
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
rights and I'm trying to remember who
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
who was the subcommittee chair on that
 
00:58:01.549 --> 00:58:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
kab going to
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
362 so for
 
00:58:11.549 --> 00:58:11.559 align:start position:0%
362 we had met with the Human Rights
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
Commission in at the end of June
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
and we were led to believe that the
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
oldest case at that time was February of
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
2022 and we thought okay well maybe
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
they've caught up things aren't that
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
bad when we
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
returned and we started talking about
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
this in the fall we had some attorneys
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
who were testifying that they had cases
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
that had been pending since 2019 so long
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
story short we ended up clarifying and
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
the HRC meant that when they said that
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
2022 piece they meant that that was the
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
oldest case that was waiting to be
 
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
assigned to an
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
investigator um but that that wasn't the
 
00:58:56.829 --> 00:58:56.839 align:start position:0%
actual oldest pending in case so at that
 
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
point we were kind of like well there's
 
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
a much bigger problem
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
and this particular Bill isn't meant to
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
fix the problem as a whole there is a
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
current LBA audit going we're not going
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
to get the results back for a couple
 
00:59:15.789 --> 00:59:15.799 align:start position:0%
months this was fixing kind of one small
 
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
piece of an overall arching
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
problem representative Andrew and I felt
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
like we should really do something to
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
solve a little bit of the problem even
 
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
if we can't solve the whole problem so
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
voted uh in favor of the initial Bell
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
however the rest of the committee
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
members felt like maybe we should
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps wait until the audit is
 
00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
completed and do an overall fix of all
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
the problems and so they had voted itl
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much um Mr chair
 
00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
this this is a a bill that um both uh
 
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
representative D Lorenzo and I um
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
initially uh supported in the previous
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
session no the previous
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
term um there was significant concern
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
about what was happening in um the
 
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
commission and as a result of this of a
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
very detailed summer study that was
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
headed by representative Mark
 
01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
McLean um we unanimously asked um the uh
 
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
the appropriate committee to request
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
that the LBA conduct not a financial
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
audit but a performance audit and we
 
01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
asked that because in example after
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
example we found
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
um information that was not not accurate
 
01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:03.559 align:start position:0%
that was not consistent we found
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment that the commission was
 
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
not in conformance with either the law
 
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.670 align:start position:0%
not in conformance with either the law
or

01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
regulations um that had that the
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
legislative and the executive
 
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
departments had developed um and we
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
heard from any number of uh individuals
 
01:01:24.079 --> 01:01:25.109 align:start position:0%
heard from any number of uh individuals
on

01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
both sides of certainly of the
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
employment issue meaning employers and
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
employees the delays of years was just
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
unacceptable the information we went to
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
the uh and asked that um an audit be
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
conducted the fiscal committee agreed
 
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
that a performance audit should be
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
conducted and immediately the um they
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
they began to collect their information
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
they have been working on that for any
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
number of months they have ex we do not
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
know the specifics because they are
 
01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh as they should be
 
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
completely discreet about not sharing
 
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
with us anything until they finish but
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
we can observe certain things in that
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
they have had to do um investigations on
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
their own without getting information
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
that they could get from the commission
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
again and again again we saw problems
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
meanwhile because we were concerned we
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh enthusiastically supported getting
 
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.230 align:start position:0%
uh enthusiastically supported getting
additional

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
staff for the human uh relations
 
01:02:48.029 --> 01:02:48.039 align:start position:0%
commission we thought that that was
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
certainly one thing that should happen
 
01:02:53.309 --> 01:02:53.319 align:start position:0%
and the finance committee agreed and in
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
fact in the budget additional staff was
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
um agreed to and that
 
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
staff would be available as of the start
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year which was July
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
1 it was not until last
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
week that the first of those positions
 
01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.109 align:start position:0%
week that the first of those positions
was

01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
advertised and I you know in in Open
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
Session the commissioner had explained
 
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
why she had not moved before but if
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
Staffing was so
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
important tell me why you wait from July
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
1 to November 1 to even advertise when
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
you know once you advertise it's going
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
to be another number of months before
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
you could
 
01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
hire um I initially felt very strongly
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
that we should pass the the bill that's
 
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
before us we've learned from lawyers on
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
both sides that there are in fact very
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
few cases that would be
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
affected um and we did ask um if the two
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
sides of in terms of the lawyers would
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
see if they could come up with a
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
suggestion of how this could work best
 
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
and they couldn't and they didn't I um
 
01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
would suggest to you that this is a
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
commission that is is in real
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
trouble and I don't see the
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
value of because I know how committed I
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
am to making that commission one of the
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
strongest commissions we have in this
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
state I don't see the value of fixing
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
what I I guess would cruely refer to as
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
a hang nail when um the heart and the
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
lungs might be might need help first so
 
01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
I don't think we accomplish a thing by
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
making this one change and I think it is
 
01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for us to wait until we get
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
the results of the report that we
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
requested on how on on the performance
 
01:05:14.029 --> 01:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
audit of that commission before we make
 
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
any changes to make one little change
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
now and then realized that we've
 
01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:23.799 align:start position:0%
accomplished nothing in the whole order
 
01:05:26.829 --> 01:05:26.839 align:start position:0%
of things I think is just not good
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
governance other other
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
comments representative Horgan um well
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
yes I first of all I guess I'll say that
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
I generally support the performance
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
audit and those performance audits are
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
very thorough and the results are
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
usually very interesting and probably
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's probably painful to go through the
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
process but I've seen a number of those
 
01:05:50.349 --> 01:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I mean I think the commission uh
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
needs a lot of improvement I'm not quite
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
as negative about us speciic
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
specifically I think there's an emic
 
01:05:57.309 --> 01:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
problem throughout state government with
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
like a large number of entities which uh
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
deal with similar issues and they're
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
probably I think maybe they're all less
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
than perfect well of course they all
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
they're all less than perfect but then I
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
guess maybe this is this is what's in
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
front of us so we may as well start by
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
looking at that one so I certainly
 
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
support the uh waiting till after the
 
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
performance audit I think maybe we're
 
01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
being a little bit too harsh on them and
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
they're probably um I also say like the
 
01:06:24.079 --> 01:06:25.150 align:start position:0%
they're probably um I also say like the
original

01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
bill was just to uh change make a tech
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
fairly technical change with most
 
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
procedures Z just only the complainant
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
can move to another venue in this either
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
the complaintant or the respondent and
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
can and uh so some individuals in legal
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
profession were concerned about that and
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's uh theoretically it's probably a
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
good change although I managed to dig up
 
01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
the bill file from
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
1999 which actually one of the
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of the bill that were
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
that bill was passed in 99 was a
 
01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative for Sandy uh Sandy ke who
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
was until a few years ago member of this
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
committee so that was they added the
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
respondes basically I think it's a
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
compromise to get get you know the uh
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
Bill through the house in Senate and
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor so uh
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
I I definitely think we should probably
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
leave the law away at it for now and
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
certainly we'll uh we'll await the uh
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
performance audit with interest and I'm
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
sure there'll be many many useful
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
suggest questions in it but other
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
comments so I guess I um the only
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
comment I that I would make is is this
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
I I could be persuaded at some point if
 
01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission properly
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
functioning um that the change that has
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
been proposed in the original amendment
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
to allow only the the claimant but not
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
the I mean only the the plaintiff but
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
not the employer or or uh the other or
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
other respondent to remove I might be
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
able to support that um if the
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
commission were were operating
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
efficiently and and sort of properly for
 
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term but given I I tend
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
to share the the concerns that have been
 
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
expressed by representative Smith um
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
about what is happening there and in
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
that circumstance it seems to me that
 
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
both sides of a dispute should have an
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
escape Val which is what um the current
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
law allows even though it's a sort of in
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
particularly from the the perspective of
 
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
the respondent uh in those cases it's a
 
01:08:41.309 --> 01:08:41.319 align:start position:0%
pretty inefficient Escape valve at least
 
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
it's some Escape valve and given given
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
the the circumstances of what's going of
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
of the current situation at least
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
as I think is is an accurate one um I I
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't think we should eliminate that
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
escape valou at least now and so I I'm
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
in agreement with representative Smith
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh resolution of this bill
 
01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
would be itl uh to await the uh
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
performance audit I wonder if I could
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
just ask could I just again informally
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
could I just ask for a show of hands how
 
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right um all right um next I
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
want to go on for discussion purposes
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
and I I I since I'm virtually
 
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
certain that we will not be voting on
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
this bill today because I think that
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
there will be we will this is the one
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill that I think we likely will be
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
completely at loggerheads on is House
 
01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:49.749 align:start position:0%
completely at loggerheads on is House
Bill

01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
396 my I guess what I would what I would
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
say is this
 
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
my impression and then I will open it up
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
to discussion if people have a different
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
take on this but my impression on 396 is
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
that as as you may know there is a there
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
is an amendment that was proposed by
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative Perez back in the spring
 
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
um that was voted on and uh and it
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
failed be on a 10 to 10 vote um my
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
impression is that nothing really
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
changed on that and that if that motion
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
were if we if we discuss that again now
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
that that would that all again would
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
fail on a 10 to 10 vote my suspicion is
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
that there would then be a motion um of
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
uh of itl and that that would fail on a
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
10 to1 vote and then we would be back to
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
the original Bill we'd have a vote on
 
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
that and that would result in a 10 to 10
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
vote and we would go to the floor in
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
January with a no recommendation so
 
01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
that and what I would suggest so I guess
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm really asking is does anybody
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
have kind of a different take on what is
 
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
likely to happen um number one and
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
number two if that is what's likely to
 
01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
happen I we will not vote on that until
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
next week representative Smith well I
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
guess there two things um um one would
 
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
hope that uh someone might change his or
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
her vote of course I would hope they
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
would change it to my side but who knows
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
um but uh if that's not the case there
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
is another choice and that is that we
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
could um keep the bill and uh uh work on
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
it over the summer and then be able to
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation to the next
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
legislature of how we might want to
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
handle it and um uh and why would we do
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
because in all cander it will help to
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
keep the temperature down I'm not too
 
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
cold I'm awfully cold right now but I
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
mean just out to a nice moderate
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
temperature where we who are facing some
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
very serious questions that affect so
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
many of us in so many ways might want to
 
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
put this this one issue aside while we
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
try to try to really come work hard to
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
come to agreement on other issues um I'm
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that there will suddenly
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
be a bolt of lightning and we will see
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
the light and have a clearer idea of
 
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
where to go I just guess I like to cons
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
consider the possibility of putting off
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
have having to have um what will be a
 
01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.390 align:start position:0%
have having to have um what will be a
very

01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
painful uh discussion on an issue that
 
01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
affects a certain number of people in
 
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
very different
 
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
ways anybody um yes representative Perez
 
01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.110 align:start position:0%
ways anybody um yes representative Perez
thank

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
you as I told you a couple of weeks ago
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
I will not be here next week I'll be at
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
the um National Education
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.390 align:start position:0%
the um National Education
symposium

01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
I would like to see us deal with this
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
today since it is my amendment that I am
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
putting forward um I would like to see
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
it dealt with today so but you're you're
 
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
in charge so well I was not yeah no well
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know what I guess what I would say
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
is this I I I as as I think I mentioned
 
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
on when we had our caucus I I
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative Smith had indicated to me
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
quite a while ago that she was going to
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
have someone absent from this uh from
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
today and um and as a result of that I
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
basically said to her look we'll if we
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
are in if we are in consensus on bills
 
01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
we'll vote on them today if we're not we
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
will put that off until uh until next
 
01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
week um and so I'm first I'm perfectly
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
happy to have a discussion about 39 I
 
01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
mean if you want to have a discussion
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
and talk in favor of your motion um uh
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing to have a
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
discussion on it but I think it I would
 
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
not be prepared to vote on it today I
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
will say to you that I mean you have
 
01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
nothing you have you have no worry at
 
01:14:30.189 --> 01:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
all that your motion your Amendment will
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
be introduced next week it will be it
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
will be introduced by nobody else by me
 
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
because my your amendment is basically a
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
mirror almost of mine um M Mr chair yeah
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
um I was not aware of Representative
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
paris's um conflict and I believe that
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
we each owe
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
loyalty um to the members of our um of
 
01:14:59.229 --> 01:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
our committee um and I I'm we do have
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
one person missing we have arranged uh
 
01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
to have a substitute for today so in
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
purpose in in in terms of the the
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
vote the vote itself would be a vote of
 
01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
20 people 19 of us plus a substitute and
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
I personally feel that I owe it to my
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
colleague on the committee since she
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
feels so strongly about this and it is
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
her amendment that in fact we do vote on
 
01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
it um today all right no that's F I
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate your willing to do that uh uh
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
it's never easy I mean it's you know
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
another Solomon question here but um
 
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
since in fact we don't have to divide
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
the baby it's okay all right well I
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate that very much represent
 
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
Smith All right so um
 
01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
so I guess back to my my my suspicion I
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
mean it's certainly I and I say this is
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
certainly my view my suspicion is that
 
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
to the extent representative Smith was
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
talking about a third option being
 
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
interim study basically for this bill um
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
I would oppose that and my suspicion is
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
that the members of my caucus would also
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
oppose that and so that vote I think
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
would come to a 10 to 10 vote also but
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
if somebody thinks you know if somebody
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
had does think that they have a
 
01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
different view on that and we you know
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
then that we're only we're only
 
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
discussing right now we have no idea how
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
right no no no but I'm just sort of
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
asking if if if somebody thinks that my
 
01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
recitation of what is likely to happen
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
is inaccurate um please you know speak
 
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
up representative
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
sableton I don't have another
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
interpretation but we spent a lot of
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
time on on this and I think we should
 
01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
move the
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
question I okay well as I say I I very
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
much appreciate representative Smith's
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
willingness to all that
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
yes right well we can yeah we can we can
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
begin the executive session
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
um all right but um so I guess what I'd
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
like to do then is I think we can go
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
through several bills relatively quickly
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
before we actually get to making uh
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
um

you that sounds great we are one you
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
know with regard to this can I ask
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
please the the bills that we vote on
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
today could I ask please that you get
 
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
your reports to me by the close of
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
business tomorrow I realize that the
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
we're what we're going to be voting some
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
of the bigger ones we will not be voting
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
on today I think most of the ones we'll
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
be voting on today will be relatively
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
with one exception uh relatively easy
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to get those reports in for
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
both for for my purposes so I have time
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
to review them and secondly I think it's
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
important that the clerk's office not
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%

01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman this is um an issue which
 
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
has thank you this is an issue which the
 
01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee has struggled over
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
for a very long time longer than this
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
term it is a struggle that is well worth
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
taking because the work of the human
 
01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
relations Commission
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
is so important to the Integrity of
 
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:56.910 align:start position:0%
is so important to the Integrity of
state

01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:29:01.109 --> 01:29:01.119 align:start position:0%
government that um it deserves all the
 
01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
attention that we can possibly give it
 
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
concerns previous Judiciary Committee
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
asked the um and got approval
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
for um the LBA to conduct a detailed
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
performance audit
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
I hope by now that all members of this
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
committee are familiar with the work of
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
the LBA in performance Audits and if
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
there is someone who isn't I'm hoping
 
01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
that they will go online and just pick
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
one at random to see how thorough those
 
01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
reports are how they start with the law
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
and they go to the rules and they
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
address issues with in great depth they
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
identify problems but they don't stop
 
01:29:55.830 --> 01:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
there they identify Solutions as ways
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
that whatever agency is being evaluated
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
could best meet their obligations to the
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution the laws and the rules of
 
01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
the state and in
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
addition they put time limits on and
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
checklist um so that in no and all of
 
01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
this is done with consultation with the
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
staff of the
 
01:30:24.189 --> 01:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
agency um there are all over the country
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
there are states that look at our LBA
 
01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:31.400 align:start position:0%
process with admiration and I would lead
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
the cheering Squad because we
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
have a a performance audit now underway
 
01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
that we will not see un to the spring I
 
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
believe that it is responsible for us to
 
01:30:52.109 --> 01:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
take no action on the specific question
 
01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
that's before us relating to how the
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
human relations commission operates and
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
instead suggest that we vote itl on this
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
bill and be prepared when the um when
 
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
the uh performance audit is finished to
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
look at it in Great depth with all the
 
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
people we need to help advise us to come
 
01:31:18.109 --> 01:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
up with the best possible plan for the
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
future of that
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
agency anyone else wish to be heard on
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%

FN um and I'm going to uh recognize
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%

uh to I to itl uh that bill uh is there
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
a second I second I'd like to speak to
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
that for a minute um you may recall that
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
this bill originally was um the original
 
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
bill was designed to it would have
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
given the Department of Education the
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
authority to Pro prosecute and I don't I
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
use that in a uh not in the sense of
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
prosecute of like crimes but to
 
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
prosecute civil cases before the Human
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission that involved uh
 
01:33:59.550 --> 01:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
allegations that arose out of department
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
of education related kinds of things
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
like a claim that a teacher had
 
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
discriminated against a student in some
 
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
way or whatever the Department of
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
Education wanted the authority to
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
prosecute those cases before the Human
 
01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:15.189 align:start position:0%
prosecute those cases before the Human
Rights

01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
Commission uh itself as opposed to
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
having the Attorney General's office Do
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
It um eventually
 
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
we expressed a lot of concern in this
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
committee about that um and eventually
 
01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
the the Department of Education
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
indicated that they uh that they didn't
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
they weren't really pressing us to go
 
01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
forward with that um and that they were
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
going to work try to work out some kind
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
of a memorandum of understanding with
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
office it's not clear to me whether they
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
have actually done that or not but they
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
haven't come back and you know asked us
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
to re to revisit the original bill at
 
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
any rate there was an amendment to the
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
bill that that really had dealt with a a
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
different subject and that was the
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education having subpoena
 
01:35:05.470 --> 01:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
power uh for certain uh matters um there
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
was there was some controversy about
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
that also
 
01:35:16.189 --> 01:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
um as a result I have introduced with um
 
01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
great input from representative kutab
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps others
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
um a new bill this year that deals with
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
that deals with subpoena power for the
 
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Education it's very um
 
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
it's very limited and specific as to
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
what kinds of cases the department would
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
have subpoena power um and I'm hoping
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
that that in the next legislative
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
session we may be able to achieve some
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
consensus on that but um at any rate
 
01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
that's a long way of saying that's the
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
reason that I don't think there's any
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
need to to proceed with any version of
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
53 3 right now um so and that's the
 
01:35:56.669 --> 01:35:56.679 align:start position:0%
reason for my itl motion anyone else
 
01:35:59.229 --> 01:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
533 well yes I agree that this bill is
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it was also well poorly
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
there are few emissions in the drafting
 
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
one it didn't specifically mentioned
 
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
Charter Public Schools which although
 
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
those are probably covered under school
 
01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't cover other education
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
providers who paid for public funds
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
whether through the uh so-called
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account programs are
 
01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
just through other programs so those are
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
also not covered there so it's like uh
 
01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
even if even if the basic idea was
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
something I would support it would need
 
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
I would have expected to be like
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
significantly drafted because there's
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
like a lot of uh they left a lot of
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
stuff out of the original bill but um
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly happy to I certainly agree
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
that it's itl and it's certainly s
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
certainly happily vote Yes on the itl
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
so anyone else wish to be heard on uh 5
 
01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
33 representative Perez thank you V I

right of subpoena power for the
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%

01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:06.040 align:start position:0%

motion yeah we originally held on to
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
this bill thinking there might be more
 
01:38:54.669 --> 01:38:54.679 align:start position:0%
information or make this more of a
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
widespread issue but it seems to me like
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
there was only one or two lead
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
inspectors that felt grieved by the
 
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
current process and not many more so um
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%

01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
to this bill and I've gone I frankly
 
01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
have have gone back and forth wavered uh
 
01:40:45.239 --> 01:40:46.470 align:start position:0%
have have gone back and forth wavered uh
uh

01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
uh as as as I've thought about this over
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
the course of many months now
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
um and there has been there have
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
been at at our subcommittee
 
01:41:00.159 --> 01:41:02.430 align:start position:0%
been at at our subcommittee
session

01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:04.109 align:start position:0%
session
um

01:41:04.109 --> 01:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
a suggestion was made that
 
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
the the proponents of the bill sort of
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
agreed that they didn't mean by the bill
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
to say that any
 
01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
time somebody was
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
something bad for lack of a better ter
 
01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
something adverse was going to be said
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
by a public
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
body um in a meeting that was closed to
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
the public because of that for that
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
reason because somebody was there was
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
going to be some adverse mention made or
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
discussion made of somebody um they the
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
proponents of the bill agreed that just
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
because that was going to happen didn't
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
mean that in every that that the person
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
should have the right to be notified of
 
01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
the of that fact and to be present and
 
01:41:57.390 --> 01:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
to to be able to be heard in their own
 
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
um in their own defense they suggested
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
that um what what they're really getting
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
at is only if some action was going to
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
be taken against somebody um at at such
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
a session should the person have a right
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
to be present and and to be uh to be
 
01:42:19.229 --> 01:42:19.239 align:start position:0%
notified and to be present and to speak
 
01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
in their own behalf so I drafted a
 
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment which I didn't dra I
 
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
didn't file officially but I circulated
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
among the subcommittee and to others um
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
and now I've this morning um or actually
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
I should say uh yeah this morning two
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
other proposed amendments were given to
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
me by um
 
01:42:44.639 --> 01:42:46.270 align:start position:0%
me by um
uh

01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%

01:42:50.189 --> 01:42:50.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh Brom O'Brien and the
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
more recent an amendment was given to me
 
01:42:56.189 --> 01:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
by uh representative Perez and
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
Alexander um that expands
 
01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.830 align:start position:0%
Alexander um that expands
on

01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
um the idea of somebody having the right
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
to be present um if if uh
 
01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.870 align:start position:0%
to be present um if if uh
some

01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
action is going to be
 
01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:23.629 align:start position:0%
action is going to be
taken

01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
uh see Pro provide to any Vote or to if
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
some action is going to be taken against
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
that individual
 
01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
um and my concern about this my my basic
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
concern about and and by the way the ex
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
the the amendment by representative
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
Alexander and Perez contains a number of
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
exceptions um when the bill would not
 
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
apply my concern about this is twofold
 
01:43:55.589 --> 01:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
the the first concern is
 
01:43:55.599 --> 01:43:57.149 align:start position:0%
the the first concern is
that

01:43:57.149 --> 01:43:57.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:01.229 --> 01:44:01.239 align:start position:0%
the all of these proposed amendments to
 
01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
to the right to no law don't really have
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
anything or at least very little to do
 
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
with the purpose of the right to no law
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
which is what is public and what is not
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
public this this these proposed
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
amendments for lack of a better term
 
01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
they support to give
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
somebody due process rights in other
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
words the right to be the right to be
 
01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
heard uh the right to notice and to be
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
heard and to have an opportunity to to
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
sort of speak in your own defense be
 
01:44:39.310 --> 01:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
before something bad happens to you as a
 
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
general proposition I don't have any
 
01:44:43.629 --> 01:44:43.639 align:start position:0%
problem with that idea of course that I
 
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
mean that that makes
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
sense but it doesn't make sense in the
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
right to no law
 
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't make
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
sense to do it at this time I mean the
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
pro for example let me just read to
 
01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
you one of the the last section of this
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that has been proposed
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
it says the requirements of of sub
 
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
paragraph one that's the one that would
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
now give you the right to to to be
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
present to have uh council president to
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
speak on your own behalf subsection two
 
01:45:20.109 --> 01:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
says the right the requirements of
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph one shall not apply to the
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
office of professional lure and
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
certification or the boards and
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
commissions under the office of
 
01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
supervision including but not limited to
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the offices boards
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
commissions pursuant to RSA and then
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
list it lists a whole bunch of one two
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
three four five six 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
 
01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
it list 14 statutory things where to
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
which it wouldn't reply apply my con
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
concern is that if we were to pass this
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
am this is flying by the seat of your
 
01:46:00.589 --> 01:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
pants um we don't know and I don't I
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
please please understand I'm not
 
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
suggesting for a moment that anybody's
 
01:46:06.189 --> 01:46:06.199 align:start position:0%
acting in bad faith but we haven't had a
 
01:46:08.589 --> 01:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
chance to really look at these study
 
01:46:12.669 --> 01:46:12.679 align:start position:0%
these in any de in any depth and more
 
01:46:16.589 --> 01:46:16.599 align:start position:0%
importantly if the implications of this
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
bill it seems to me this if we were to
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
pass this this bill would
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
say on a very broad
 
01:46:28.109 --> 01:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
basis that
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
anybody who uh who a some public board
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be speaking adversely about
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
and may take some action about may take
 
01:46:46.109 --> 01:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.149 --> 01:46:49.159 align:start position:0%
have has a right to to be notified and
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to speak
 
01:46:54.669 --> 01:46:54.679 align:start position:0%
and it's not we don't know what kind of
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
action we're talking about how
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
significant it is um anything like that
 
01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
and to put that in the right to no law
 
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
just seems to me to be a really bad idea
 
01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
if if if something like this is is going
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
to be proposed in other words if we want
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
to create as a matter of Statute a
 
01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
general right of due process
 
01:47:23.589 --> 01:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
um for anybody that may face certain ad
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
some adverse action by a public body
 
01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
then then that may be a very good idea
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
but let's do it in a careful thoughtful
 
01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
way and not in the right to no law
 
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't really it really has
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
very little to do with the right to no
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
law it should and the implications but
 
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
of this potentially could be very very
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
broad um
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
so that's my basic concern about moving
 
01:47:58.669 --> 01:47:58.679 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill at this time I
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
just think it's not it's not ready for
 
01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:02.030 align:start position:0%
just think it's not it's not ready for
Prime

01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
Prime
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
Time representative
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you respectfully I
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
disagree um you're a lawyer I'm a nurse
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
retired both retired we look at things
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
that a little different you're looking
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
very more legal e I'm looking at it as
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
we when we first discussed this we had
 
01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.030 align:start position:0%
we when we first discussed this we had
the

01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:34.589 --> 01:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities represented in all this
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this as a right to know
 
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
because this is for the little guy this
 
01:48:45.790 --> 01:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
is for the person who lives in a
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
town who somebody doesn't like them on

town's councel or the school board and
 
01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:01.709 align:start position:0%

01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
even know what this is
 
01:49:15.199 --> 01:49:17.229 align:start position:0%
even know what this is
about

01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
a something that I can't talk about
 
01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
just happened to show that this needs to
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
be done and not go to court because
 
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
these type of there's a name for it when
 
01:49:33.149 --> 01:49:33.159 align:start position:0%
frivolous what do they call those when
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
frivolous suit no no there's a name it's
 
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:39.880 align:start position:0%

01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
of thing is happening more and more and
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
more and to make it part of legal ease
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
and not part of the 91a which which
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
protects the I feel that the protect 91a
 
01:49:57.629 --> 01:49:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
person I this is where it needs to be
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
happening day in and day out I know it's
 
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
happened to me I know it's happened to
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
other people who sit on this committee
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's time that John Doe had an
 
01:50:17.629 --> 01:50:17.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to find out who's knifing
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
them in the back before they have to
 
01:50:23.229 --> 01:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
you're a lawyer thank you yes
 
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
chair I also am like you and I wavered
 
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill for months and something
 
01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
happened to me recently in town that
 
01:50:37.149 --> 01:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
makes me believe that this bill is
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
needed more than ever um when a certain
 
01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.149 align:start position:0%
needed more than ever um when a certain
board

01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
discusses a a communication I sent to a
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
director of of town and they're just
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
they're talking talking about me in a
 
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
very derogatory way and the only reason
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
I would know about it is to file a right
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
to know request which I did and it came
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
up to where they were saying some very
 
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
hateful things about me over
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
email I think that this needs like we
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
need to expand the right to no law to
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
deal with these sort of situations when
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
not even me like I'm a State Rep I can
 
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
handle it like if you slander me like I
 
01:51:17.709 --> 01:51:17.719 align:start position:0%
can't sue you like I'm an elected
 
01:51:19.709 --> 01:51:19.719 align:start position:0%
official I can handle this but I really
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
do feel for the little guy who does not
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
know their rights does not know that
 
01:51:27.390 --> 01:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to be that they're
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
allowed to file requests like this I
 
01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
believe strongly that this this
 
01:51:33.790 --> 01:51:33.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that we propose needs to pass
 
01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
um I mean based on a personal situation
 
01:51:38.109 --> 01:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
but also um this happening to a little
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
guy all over the
 
01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:42.310 align:start position:0%
guy all over the
place

01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
other anyone else wish to speak yes
 
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes employees are and other people
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
in business or government do things that
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
are UNT toward or even wrong um or
 
01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:01.149 align:start position:0%
are UNT toward or even wrong um or
malicious

01:52:01.149 --> 01:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
malicious
 
01:52:01.159 --> 01:52:02.870 align:start position:0%
malicious
and

01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes officials have to come
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
together to uh discuss that even before
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
taking any
 
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
action and to protect the reputation of
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
the person in question I believe it
 
01:52:20.669 --> 01:52:20.679 align:start position:0%
should be done in PR priv
 
01:52:25.229 --> 01:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
it at least for that those that board to
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
consider and exchange the information
 
01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
and to make some kind of a
 
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
determination um before they go
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
forward now if if they're going to take
 
01:52:39.069 --> 01:52:39.079 align:start position:0%
an action of dismissal or punishment of
 
01:52:39.079 --> 01:52:40.109 align:start position:0%
an action of dismissal or punishment of
some

01:52:40.109 --> 01:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
sort does not when that punishment is
 
01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
delivered the person has a a right
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
to uh ask for a he
 
01:52:54.069 --> 01:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
hearing and to bring forward that uh
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
information so that they have an
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to contest it we talking
 
01:53:00.669 --> 01:53:00.679 align:start position:0%
about two different procedures here
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
information gathering in in the
 
01:53:07.149 --> 01:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
non-public session and then a possible
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh hearing e either private or public
 
01:53:12.589 --> 01:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
requested by the person who is
 
01:53:12.599 --> 01:53:14.109 align:start position:0%
requested by the person who is
affected

01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
affected
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
um this is why I'm having a problem with
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
excluding that information gathering
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
that discussion among responsible
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
supervisors and people in position to
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
consider whether whether there's been a
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
fault committed um and if so how
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
egregious it might be or or not before
 
01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:45.800 align:start position:0%
process yeah sure thank you this is
 
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
saying I'm going to give you an example
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
this is saying okay here's the Town
 
01:53:53.709 --> 01:53:53.719 align:start position:0%
Council somebody over there in town
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
complained about me that had something
 
01:53:57.629 --> 01:53:57.639 align:start position:0%
to do with the
 
01:54:00.589 --> 01:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
town the town Council gets together and
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
discusses it nobody's saying they cannot
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
discuss it without me but before they
 
01:54:11.069 --> 01:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
take any action before they decide to
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
you know take legal legal action or to
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
you know censor me or
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
whatever I have a right to go before
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
them find out what it is that the
 
01:54:28.069 --> 01:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
complaint was and to then hear my side
 
01:54:30.069 --> 01:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
of the story I'm going to tell you that
 
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
there was just something brought down by
 
01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
said it was a a town did a very
 
01:54:45.069 --> 01:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
frivolous frivolous thing and this is to
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
stop that now we're not talking as if I
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
stole from the town or I threaten
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
somebody's life we're not talking things
 
01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
that should not even be to the Town
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
Council they should have gone directly
 
01:54:58.589 --> 01:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
to the police department we're
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
talking things that can be as what
 
01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
happened to representative Alexander
 
01:55:06.669 --> 01:55:06.679 align:start position:0%
slanderous there's a lot of that going
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
on now a lot of it and because people
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
are speaking up and if you don't like
 
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
what I have to say well then I'm going
 
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
to complain about you this protects the
 
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
little guy and yes he may have a right
 
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
to a hearing but not everybody's going
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
to do that get a
 
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
lawyer let me find out what your
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
complaint is before you crucify
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
me anybody else have anything to say
 
01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:36.030 align:start position:0%
me anybody else have anything to say
representative

01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
State I I was just trying to draw a
 
01:55:41.790 --> 01:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
distinction between information
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
gathering and exchange discussion versus
 
01:55:48.589 --> 01:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
taking an Express
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
action when you go to express action now
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
you've got to follow some protocols and
 
01:55:58.750 --> 01:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
some law and some rules um and and I I
 
01:56:01.550 --> 01:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
think that this bill doesn't address the
 
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
difference between information
 
01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:06.719 align:start position:0%
discussion and The Taking of
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
action any other com yeah I think I mean
 
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
to me I think you really hit the nail on
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
the head Mr stat and representative uh
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
Perez this you know you said this
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to the situation of
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
somebody of somebody that stole money
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
for example but the problem is that
 
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
under this language yes it would yes it
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
would apply to that because if the the
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem it's too broad
 
01:56:35.069 --> 01:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
you if if under under this proposed
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment if if somebody came in to uh
 
01:56:42.069 --> 01:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
one of one of the Selectmen for example
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
came in at a selectman's meeting and
 
01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that you know we have we
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
have information that someone someone uh
 
01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
has been who who we do we contract with
 
01:56:55.950 --> 01:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
or whatever we do we do some business
 
01:56:58.589 --> 01:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
with or something like that has been
 
01:57:01.470 --> 01:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
stealing money or ripping us
 
01:57:05.069 --> 01:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
off that be and that was going to be
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
discussed in a non-public session um and
 
01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
may with maybe the result being that the
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
that the the board of selectman says you
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
know we better we better notify the
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
police about this under this language
 
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to do that without
 
01:57:22.910 --> 01:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
notifying the person by the way we think
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
you're stealing money which might be a
 
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
you know that there could be I can
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
imagine many many circumstances in which
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
the last thing you would want to do is
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
tell the person that who who you think
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
is involved in in some kind of ongoing
 
01:57:39.069 --> 01:57:39.079 align:start position:0%
theft by the way we know about it um and
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
the and we're referring it to the police
 
01:57:43.629 --> 01:57:43.639 align:start position:0%
you might you might there may be any
 
01:57:46.030 --> 01:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
really good reasons why you'd want to
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
keep that information confidential uh
 
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
and the police when they get the when
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
they get it they may very well want to
 
01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
keep it confidential until they get to a
 
01:57:56.910 --> 01:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
point where they think it's appropriate
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
to to uh to sort of you know come out in
 
01:58:03.390 --> 01:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
the open um with their investigation
 
01:58:06.069 --> 01:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
that's the problem there certainly I
 
01:58:08.910 --> 01:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
agree with you there are situations in
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
which in which before some final adverse
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
action is taken against somebody they
 
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
ought to have the right to be noticed
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
and a hearing and all that but the way
 
01:58:23.270 --> 01:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
this is worded it it's not limited to
 
01:58:25.709 --> 01:58:25.719 align:start position:0%
that it's much too broad and that's my
 
01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
problem with it any any other
 
01:58:32.589 --> 01:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
discussion all right I guess we're ready

um this is um a double
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
header we have two
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
bills before the committee today dealing
 
02:02:44.589 --> 02:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
um basically with
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
privacy um each of the bills applies to
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
to private sector
 
02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:55.679 align:start position:0%
businesses neither of the
 
02:03:00.669 --> 02:03:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:04.270 --> 02:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
governments SB
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
255 provides information privacy
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
protections for New Hampshire
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
customers of most but not all larger
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
companies selling goods and or services
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
and doing business in this
 
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
state it allows them to opt out of the
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
company's use of their personal
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
information for marketing purposes and
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
by allowing them to look at obtain a
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
copy correct and delete personal
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
information held by the companies that
 
02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
is the crucial part of SB
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
255 there are a number of other uh uh
 
02:03:53.229 --> 02:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
specifics which is why we have labored
 
02:03:56.830 --> 02:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
so long and hard at these
 
02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:58.830 align:start position:0%
so long and hard at these
bills

02:03:58.830 --> 02:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that we're proposal
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
proposing provides privacy protections
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
to more individuals by expanding the
 
02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
number of companies covered by the act
 
02:04:16.589 --> 02:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
and we do that by reducing the threshold
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
of coverage from a company having
 
02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
100,000 unique customers in this state
 
02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:25.270 align:start position:0%
100,000 unique customers in this state
to

02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
35,000 we reduce the threshold of the
 
02:04:32.109 --> 02:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
group referred to as data Brokers from
 
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
25,000 to
 
02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
10,000 we require procedural uniformity
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
to make it easier for consumers to
 
02:04:44.189 --> 02:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
exercise their rights under the
 
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
bill rather than allowing each company
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
to establish a own procedure so we have
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
these procedures are in notifying
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
individuals of their rights in opting
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
out of Marketing programs and in
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
requesting access to changes in or
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
deletion of their personal
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
data um we ask the Secretary of
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
State to um set the standards and
 
02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:16.350 align:start position:0%
State to um set the standards and
establish

02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
establish
 
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
procedures understanding that every
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
every one of these entities must file in
 
02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
any event with the secretary of state so
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
it is not we're not treading new
 
02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
territory or causing the Secretary of
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
State To Tread new
 
02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:34.990 align:start position:0%
State To Tread new
territory

02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
territory
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
um we provide uh means for
 
02:05:40.679 --> 02:05:42.270 align:start position:0%
um we provide uh means for
um

02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:45.189 --> 02:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh the the Attorney
 
02:05:49.069 --> 02:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
General to notify a company of a
 
02:05:52.990 --> 02:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
violation we allow time for the company
 
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
to cure that violation with no no
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
problem at all and then if it's repeated
 
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has additional um
 
02:06:08.669 --> 02:06:08.679 align:start position:0%
uh uh has additional obligations to
 
02:06:12.990 --> 02:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
act part of what we do in in this bill
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
is also reflected in the other Bill the
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
house bill uh 3
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
14 um and in any case we require that
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
the companies comply with what is the
 
02:06:33.549 --> 02:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
most protective of the
 
02:06:36.990 --> 02:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
individual um the bills are written
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
separately they one one begins in the
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
house one begins in the Senate um they
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
address different parts but of the same
 
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
problem yet they can stand alone and
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
they are written to stand alone I will
 
02:06:58.030 --> 02:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
say that if in the fullness of time both
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
pass then there would be some ease in
 
02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
making it possible to have cross
 
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
references between the bills um but
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
we're careful not to do that now because
 
02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
we're not presuming um that we know the
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
action so that is um I think as briefly
 
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
as I can present them they are it's
 
02:07:23.709 --> 02:07:23.719 align:start position:0%
incredibly important the one thing I did
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
not say and I should say at the
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
beginning and at the end is that this
 
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
should not be before the New Hampshire
 
02:07:36.750 --> 02:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
house or Senate it should not be before
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
any other state house or Senate these
 
02:07:42.830 --> 02:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
are issues which should be addressed
 
02:07:45.549 --> 02:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
nationally we should not expect
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
corporations to be able to comply with
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
what is required in one state as it
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
differs from another state we should
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
have a National Standard but in the
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
absence of the US Congress being willing
 
02:08:02.669 --> 02:08:02.679 align:start position:0%
to act in something that we think is
 
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly important and Incredibly
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
timely we've chosen to take this
 
02:08:10.990 --> 02:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
approach and we have tried in large
 
02:08:15.310 --> 02:08:15.320 align:start position:0%
measure to um act in a way that is if
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
not exact that is sympathetic to what is
 
02:08:21.750 --> 02:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
going on in other states all recognizing
 
02:08:23.709 --> 02:08:23.719 align:start position:0%
that the last thing we want to do is put
 
02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
an undue burden on the private sector
 
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
chair anyone else um wish to speak with
 
02:08:34.750 --> 02:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
regard to this bill so I yes
 
02:08:37.149 --> 02:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton thank you Mr
 
02:08:37.159 --> 02:08:38.629 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton thank you Mr
chair

02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:08:41.629 --> 02:08:41.639 align:start position:0%
um mine was more of a question here I'm
 
02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
looking at page three of line one of the
 
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
amendment of the amendment okay uh
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
relative to personal data collected
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
processed sold or disclosed in relation
 
02:08:55.629 --> 02:08:55.639 align:start position:0%
to price route or
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
Service Such terms are used in the
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
airline deregulation
 
02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
act uh or by an air carrier subject to
 
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
the ACT um unless it's someplace else
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
why only excluding Airline traffic and
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
not Railroad
 
02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.549 --> 02:09:23.559 align:start position:0%
um are we missing something by not being
 
02:09:27.390 --> 02:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
more inclusive in that particular
 
02:09:29.629 --> 02:09:29.639 align:start position:0%
exception what what
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
line page three lines one two three and
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
four oh um exception P right I see that
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
um um exception P I believe that the
 
02:09:51.390 --> 02:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
reason for these and you'll see you know
 
02:09:53.790 --> 02:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
for example in the next you'll see
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
control Substances Act um uh is to try
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure again that we are not
 
02:10:03.549 --> 02:10:03.559 align:start position:0%
setting up
 
02:10:08.589 --> 02:10:08.599 align:start position:0%
competition with existing federal law um
 
02:10:12.510 --> 02:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
and wanting to make sure that as as much
 
02:10:14.589 --> 02:10:14.599 align:start position:0%
as poss as has been brought to our
 
02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
attention trying to keep track of those
 
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
um circumstances in which these issues
 
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
are addressed in other
 
02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
contexts does that answer your question
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
well no not really I mean we've had a a
 
02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:32.709 align:start position:0%
well no not really I mean we've had a a
railroad

02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
railroad
 
02:10:36.510 --> 02:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
deregulation in the 8S um as well as
 
02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
they make reference to Airline
 
02:10:40.629 --> 02:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
deregulation I just wondered why one
 
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
mode uh can be Exempted for purposes of
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
price route or service analysis and not
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
um water rail or bus
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
line which are in the same
 
02:10:58.510 --> 02:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation sort of a business and
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
that might and that information may be
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
useful for uh determining business
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
purposes and roots and so forth I I hear
 
02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
you and I agree with your um with your
 
02:11:16.270 --> 02:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
premise but I do believe that the reason
 
02:11:19.870 --> 02:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
is says either the non lawyer I see the
 
02:11:24.149 --> 02:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
lawyer on my left is aching to answer um
 
02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
and so I'm smart enough to yield to the
 
02:11:30.629 --> 02:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
lawyer I think that the answer is this
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
and I and I should say as you may know
 
02:11:40.510 --> 02:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
um a large part of the meat of this bill
 
02:11:46.870 --> 02:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
um was was contributed to by by uh a
 
02:11:49.390 --> 02:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of of representatives of of
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
I don't mean representatives in the
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
sense of of members of the House of but
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh of people that have intimate
 
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge of of uh of how this bill how
 
02:12:03.310 --> 02:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
these bills have been dra have been
 
02:12:05.109 --> 02:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
drafted in other states and intimate
 
02:12:07.470 --> 02:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what federal laws might
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
conflict and so I think the short answer
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'm almost positive on this but if
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's somebody in the audience who who
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
thinks I'm wrong on this please speak up
 
02:12:21.069 --> 02:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
I think the answer is that it's what
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
what these various exclusions are
 
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
designed to cover is to prevent this law
 
02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
from conflicting with federal law and I
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
think that the answer to your question
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
is that it's only the airline
 
02:12:38.589 --> 02:12:38.599 align:start position:0%
deregulation act not you know the not
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
some Railroad Act or some steamship act
 
02:12:43.109 --> 02:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
or something like that like for example
 
02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
the Jones act it's not it's not those
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
laws that contain some language about
 
02:12:52.669 --> 02:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
privacy I I believe that that's the
 
02:12:56.030 --> 02:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
reason why these specific laws are
 
02:12:59.790 --> 02:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
referred to um but uh somebody thinks
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
I'm if that's not right um speak up I'm
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
I'm but I'm F in other words already
 
02:13:07.510 --> 02:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
covered by existing Statute in the
 
02:13:09.549 --> 02:13:09.559 align:start position:0%
federal well no no no in other words I
 
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
think I think just to use the railroads
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
as an
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
example because the railroad laws you
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
know the national Railway act and other
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
th those laws are pretty old they didn't
 
02:13:25.549 --> 02:13:25.559 align:start position:0%
my suspicion is that they don't have any
 
02:13:28.109 --> 02:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
language in them that deals with privacy
 
02:13:30.629 --> 02:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
issues whereas the airline deregulation
 
02:13:34.109 --> 02:13:34.119 align:start position:0%
act a much a much more recent one um I
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
think that would that developed in the
 
02:13:37.149 --> 02:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
Carter administ around the time of the
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
Carter Administration that probably does
 
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
have some of those things and so that's
 
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
why they're they're referring to it only
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
that one as opposed to um railroads yeah
 
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
they the Stagger the staggers act that
 
02:13:52.350 --> 02:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
deregulated uh railroads I think it was
 
02:13:56.669 --> 02:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
late 80s um as you say preceded maybe
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
this focus on privacy whereas the
 
02:14:02.669 --> 02:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
airline that's that's fairly recent then
 
02:14:04.109 --> 02:14:04.119 align:start position:0%
the airline
 
02:14:07.470 --> 02:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
deregulation um I'm not sure but I'm I
 
02:14:10.510 --> 02:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
no I'm not sure either but I again as I
 
02:14:14.109 --> 02:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
say I I I think if there was some land
 
02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
if there was some provision of a
 
02:14:18.510 --> 02:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
railroad regulatory statute that
 
02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
that dealt with privacy issues um we
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
would we would it it would be in there I
 
02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:31.149 --> 02:14:31.159 align:start position:0%
you other anyone else wish to speak to
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
the so the oh I'm sorry representative
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chair I have a
 
02:14:39.310 --> 02:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
question back in March when we were
 
02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:42.599 align:start position:0%
discussing these bills a gentleman from
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
the AG's office and I think I have the
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
name right a Brandon Gerard came in and
 
02:14:53.549 --> 02:14:53.559 align:start position:0%
spoke and the AG's office was against
 
02:14:55.950 --> 02:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
this bill I take it because they don't
 
02:14:59.229 --> 02:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
have enough help and etc etc so what has
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
changed that they can handle any of this
 
02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
passed well I I think a couple of my
 
02:15:13.709 --> 02:15:13.719 align:start position:0%
recollection was that they that the the
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
AG wasn't against the bill the AG was
 
02:15:20.189 --> 02:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
against was uh was suggesting that there
 
02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
should be a private right of action as
 
02:15:23.629 --> 02:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
opposed to just the Attorney General's
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
office enforcing it and was saying that
 
02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
the um the consumer protection didn't
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
division didn't have enough staff they
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
were sort of already overworked and that
 
02:15:36.069 --> 02:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
this would be you know giving them
 
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
putting too much of a burden on them but
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
my understanding is in the budget um we
 
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
have provided additional funding for the
 
02:15:45.629 --> 02:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
consumer protection division
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
specifically uh and and representative
 
02:15:48.510 --> 02:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
Smith if if you have something to add
 
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
please do well I think that's part of it
 
02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's been addressed in a number
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
of different ways one was the way we've
 
02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
tried to handle um the issue of a
 
02:16:03.790 --> 02:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
private right to action of action um
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
versus going to the attorney general um
 
02:16:09.390 --> 02:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
part of it is the
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
standardization of
 
02:16:15.069 --> 02:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
um which would be established actually
 
02:16:17.229 --> 02:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
by the Secretary of State but to make it
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
easier for the attorney general and
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
um we've
 
02:16:30.030 --> 02:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
changed some numbers in terms of um who
 
02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
would be covered by this and who
 
02:16:35.549 --> 02:16:35.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be covered by this um
 
02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
and all the subsequent meetings that
 
02:16:43.150 --> 02:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
we've had on this um I am not aware that
 
02:16:44.589 --> 02:16:44.599 align:start position:0%
although the Attorney General was
 
02:16:47.309 --> 02:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
noticed of of all the meetings I'm not
 
02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
aware that they um felt any need to come
 
02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:54.589 align:start position:0%
aware that they um felt any need to come
to

02:16:54.589 --> 02:16:54.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:16:59.549 --> 02:16:59.559 align:start position:0%
um uh address any continuing concerns so
 
02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that they're going to be much
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with this
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
now well I guess I should just say that
 
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
the it should be just so there no
 
02:17:14.669 --> 02:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
confusion 255 the this bill as
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
amended does not call for a private
 
02:17:19.629 --> 02:17:19.639 align:start position:0%
right of action there is no private
 
02:17:21.790 --> 02:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
right of action under the bill it has we
 
02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
have changed some of the language
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
concerning the circumstances under which
 
02:17:27.870 --> 02:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General can act um and
 
02:17:31.230 --> 02:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
whether he has to allow a cure or rather
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
has discretion to allow a cure and that
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
depends on the timing of when when the
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
Attorney General uh acts um but there
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
there is still no private right of
 
02:17:42.750 --> 02:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
action under this bill as amended and
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
again that was know we had a number of
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
people with a number of different points
 
02:17:49.230 --> 02:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
of view working on the subcommittee we
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
got a number of a lot of different input
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
and these are all comp you know there
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
are some people I think if if you would
 
02:17:56.509 --> 02:17:56.519 align:start position:0%
ask them what what what would they
 
02:17:58.910 --> 02:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
prefer they would have said I prefer
 
02:18:00.509 --> 02:18:00.519 align:start position:0%
that this provision be different or I
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
prefer that this provision be different
 
02:18:03.429 --> 02:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
or I prefer that there be a private
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
right of action some people had had diff
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
had a different View and so this was you
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
know sort of a compromise that that the
 
02:18:14.830 --> 02:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
subcomittee came to and I I agree
 
02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
completely with representative Smith I
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
think it this is is a good bill in the
 
02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
fashion that it's in now and I hope uh
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
people will support it I I would Sugg
 
02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
that I think everybody is a little
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
unhappy I think uniformally everyone is
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
a little unhappy and so I consider that
 
02:18:31.679 --> 02:18:33.509 align:start position:0%
a little unhappy and so I consider that
a

02:18:33.509 --> 02:18:33.519 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:18:41.469 --> 02:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh if the issue of private right of
 
02:18:48.030 --> 02:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
action was brought up during hearings
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
was there a reason why it was not put
 
02:18:53.309 --> 02:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
the provision was not put
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
in well I think I think yes I just said
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
we had I mean there was there was there
 
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
were suggestions for there being a
 
02:19:03.629 --> 02:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
private right of action and um the
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee you know concluded as we we
 
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
made a number of compromises along the
 
02:19:10.589 --> 02:19:10.599 align:start position:0%
way one of them was that there not there
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a private right of
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
action right anyone else uh should be
 
02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
heard all right so the motion uh before
 
02:19:23.549 --> 02:19:23.559 align:start position:0%

02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:26.840 align:start position:0%

represent representative Alexander the
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%

name on it I know that you yeah so I yes
 
02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%

chair of the subcommittee I'm gonna just
 
02:22:35.910 --> 02:22:35.920 align:start position:0%

voting for that Amendment all right but

number
2023-24

02:24:01.630 --> 02:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:03.950 --> 02:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
41h I'm gonna move to adopt the
 
02:24:06.910 --> 02:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and then I'll move to otpa
 
02:24:10.110 --> 02:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
after Mr chair yes can I ask a question
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
certainly sure
 
02:24:16.309 --> 02:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
um representative Alexander um when I
 
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
pH so in reading the amendment um the
 
02:24:25.630 --> 02:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
new paragraph Pro prohibited practices
 
02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
and sec in security deposits rental
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
application fees
 
02:24:33.110 --> 02:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
um and it goes on to say prior
 
02:24:35.550 --> 02:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
collecting any fee as part of a rental
 
02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
application or renewal process um I have
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
questions about the renewal process
 
02:24:43.469 --> 02:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
being part of this is there a reason for
 
02:24:46.510 --> 02:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
that uh that was just what we discussed
 
02:24:48.349 --> 02:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
in sub committee that was the language
 
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
that was put in there so
 
02:24:52.670 --> 02:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
um I mean we talked about it in
 
02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:54.590 align:start position:0%
um I mean we talked about it in
subcommittee

02:24:54.590 --> 02:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
02:24:57.469 --> 02:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
so that that wasn't so if I could Mr
 
02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
chair that wasn't the change that we
 
02:25:01.269 --> 02:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
made that was in all of the versions of
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
the Amendments yes um the only change
 
02:25:09.230 --> 02:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
between the two amendments 2433 and 2441
 
02:25:12.030 --> 02:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
is three words at the end of online 21
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
that says plus court costs okay so my
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:22.110 --> 02:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
the way that I read this amendment it
 
02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:24.070 align:start position:0%
the way that I read this amendment it
actually

02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
adds fees to the renewal process or
 
02:25:28.990 --> 02:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
makes the fees possible for the renewal
 
02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
process do you agree with
 
02:25:32.990 --> 02:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
that I believe that language was in the
 
02:25:36.389 --> 02:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
underlying bill as well I know yeah but
 
02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
I mean I think since since since
 
02:25:43.230 --> 02:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
application fees are not regulated now I
 
02:25:44.910 --> 02:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
think the I think the answer to your
 
02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
question would be landlord's if if we do
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
nothing land land I don't know whether
 
02:25:52.349 --> 02:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
landlords charge application fees for
 
02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
Renewal but they could because I think
 
02:25:57.389 --> 02:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
it's not regulated right now
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
right so um Mr chair with it in writing
 
02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
regulated it would make it regulated to
 
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
the extent of this of what this law says
 
02:26:14.309 --> 02:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:21.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
so yes well you know before we can I
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
just add did I a second oh so wait minut
 
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
so so I will second uh representative
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
kab's motion on uh 2023 2441 and now um
 
02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
representative kutop would you like to
 
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:47.389 --> 02:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
motion so this is the SE amendment that
 
02:26:49.870 --> 02:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
we had talked about before in the work
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
session this is just indicating that the
 
02:26:56.910 --> 02:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
court costs could also be awarded back
 
02:26:59.950 --> 02:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
to the tenant or prospective tenant from
 
02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:04.070 align:start position:0%
to the tenant or prospective tenant from
the

02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
landlord uh
 
02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
representative McBeth did you have a
 
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
question so yes your honor I mean yes uh
 
02:27:16.429 --> 02:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
chair so I um I had overlooked that this
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
the uh renewal process as well whether
 
02:27:21.150 --> 02:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
it was in the underlying bill or not I
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't I'm trying to look now at the
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
statute I think that is adding to the
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
statute and I think the housing
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
statute's you know it's a it's much more
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
black and white process so um I I don't
 
02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
know I'd like to I think that is adding
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
a whole new process allowing for this
 
02:27:40.670 --> 02:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
app the fees um but I just would like to
 
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that does then does anybody
 
02:27:47.070 --> 02:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
know um representative Alexander do you
 
02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
have any idea anywhere else is there uh
 
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
the authorization of these application I
 
02:27:53.150 --> 02:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
mean the renewal fees is that anywhere
 
02:27:54.510 --> 02:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
else in the statute I'm I'm trying to
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
look I don't see it I am not a lawyer I
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
just have a masters in public policy I
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't know I haven't read all of
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant law so um I can't tell
 
02:28:05.190 --> 02:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
you that
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
answer you know can I just
 
02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative MC Beth could I just ask
 
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
you a question I I mean I don't have the
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
statute in front of me but I was under
 
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
the impression somebody correct me if
 
02:28:18.389 --> 02:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong my impression was that the
 
02:28:21.550 --> 02:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
current landlord tenant statutes that
 
02:28:24.030 --> 02:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
are on the books did not deal with
 
02:28:27.710 --> 02:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:30.429 --> 02:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
all I'm unclear that's I just wanted to
 
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
be clear I don't know I'm I I I thought
 
02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
there I mean I thought that was the I
 
02:28:38.349 --> 02:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
wish we had representative re here but I
 
02:28:40.510 --> 02:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
thought that the whole purpose of this
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill whatever version we were talking
 
02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
about the whole purpose was to begin
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
some regulation of application fees that
 
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
didn't exist before and
 
02:28:56.030 --> 02:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
so you know I I if that is correct and
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
some well um and Mr chair the reason I
 
02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
waited until this last you know
 
02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
amendment was that um I wanted to see
 
02:29:14.750 --> 02:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
the changes before all of
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
this before this amendment
 
02:29:18.990 --> 02:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
so now it looks like it's standing and
 
02:29:21.389 --> 02:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
to me it opens a door for renewal fee
 
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
renewal fees thank you you yeah you see
 
02:29:26.349 --> 02:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
I guess the thing that I don't when you
 
02:29:30.190 --> 02:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
say opens the door if if applications
 
02:29:33.550 --> 02:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
are not regulated the door is open now
 
02:29:35.389 --> 02:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
there would be nothing that so I'm not
 
02:29:38.190 --> 02:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
quite clear what this would subject
 
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
renewal fees to this law whereas it's
 
02:29:45.630 --> 02:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
not if right now there is no law so
 
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
presumably I mean I don't I don't know
 
02:29:48.910 --> 02:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
whether landlords routinely charge
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
application fees for Renewal but if they
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
do there's nothing that prevents them
 
02:29:56.990 --> 02:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
from doing it now as I understand
 
02:29:59.550 --> 02:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
representative I certainly can see where
 
02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:01.550 align:start position:0%
representative I certainly can see where
renewal

02:30:01.550 --> 02:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
renewal
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
applications might be needed for a
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
landlord for example your situation
 
02:30:12.190 --> 02:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
changed you lost your job you lost your
 
02:30:15.269 --> 02:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
job I'm your landlord I know you lost
 
02:30:17.469 --> 02:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
your job I
 
02:30:20.269 --> 02:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
you know want to have some renewal
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
application based on the fact that you
 
02:30:27.469 --> 02:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
change jobs or lost your job this gives
 
02:30:30.429 --> 02:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
the tenant the right to get those fees
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
back if they're denied after the change
 
02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
in situation whereas if you don't have
 
02:30:39.429 --> 02:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
that there and I'm questioning renewing
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
your application because of change of
 
02:30:45.469 --> 02:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
jobs I don't have any way to get back to
 
02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
it if you don't accept me as your
 
02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:50.790 align:start position:0%
it if you don't accept me as your
staying

02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
staying
 
02:30:54.190 --> 02:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
on Mr chair yeah
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
fee I think representative Perez thought
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:15.359 --> 02:31:17.870 align:start position:0%
 
application

02:31:17.870 --> 02:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
application
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay no I meant if you're renewing your
 
02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
lease definitely but your situation has
 
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
changed I as a landlord might want to at
 
02:31:35.349 --> 02:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
you so it I mean the way it reads I
 
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
think it would be prior to collecting
 
02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:43.269 align:start position:0%
think it would be prior to collecting
any

02:31:43.269 --> 02:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:31:46.389 --> 02:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
fee which could be a part of an app
 
02:31:49.110 --> 02:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
rental application process or collecting
 
02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
any fee as part of a renewal process so
 
02:31:52.840 --> 02:31:58.349 align:start position:0%
any fee as part of a renewal process so
that

02:31:58.349 --> 02:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I'm I'm I'm still not sure
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
that I understand the concern because
 
02:32:07.830 --> 02:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's not I mean unless unless there
 
02:32:11.469 --> 02:32:11.479 align:start position:0%
somebody can point to an a provision of
 
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
existing law that
 
02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
somehow limits or regulates application
 
02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
fees um or renewal fees and I don't
 
02:32:23.070 --> 02:32:23.080 align:start position:0%
think there is but if somebody can point
 
02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
that then that might change this but if
 
02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:26.790 align:start position:0%
that then that might change this but if
there

02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:32:29.830 --> 02:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
isn't this this does regulate it where
 
02:32:31.990 --> 02:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
right now it's not
 
02:32:34.510 --> 02:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
regulated yeah the reason uh because I
 
02:32:35.710 --> 02:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly agree with you Mr
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
chairman I just I don't see that
 
02:32:39.790 --> 02:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
language to be problematic I think we
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
spent a long time over the summer
 
02:32:43.870 --> 02:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
working on this bill then we spent 50
 
02:32:46.110 --> 02:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
minutes today to come to a compromise
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
that that a majority of the committee
 
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
could be comfortable with so I do think
 
02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're kind of exhausting the
 
02:32:52.910 --> 02:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
conversation at this point um and would
 
02:32:55.309 --> 02:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
just really urge uh my colleagues to
 
02:32:57.230 --> 02:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
support this amendment because it is a
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
good compromise that we all worked on
 
02:33:01.469 --> 02:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
together thank you I and I I would Echo
 
02:33:03.870 --> 02:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
your sentiment on that I I I tend to
 
02:33:06.269 --> 02:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
think this is you know I know
 
02:33:07.710 --> 02:33:07.720 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's committee put
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
in a lot of work and they had various
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
suggestions they came to an agreement
 
02:33:13.150 --> 02:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
whereas I my recollection was we were
 
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
pretty divided uh last last spring on
 
02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:17.230 align:start position:0%
pretty divided uh last last spring on
this

02:33:17.230 --> 02:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:33:19.389 --> 02:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good compromise Mr
 
02:33:21.269 --> 02:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
chair I guess I
 
02:33:24.750 --> 02:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
misheard um representative Alexander is
 
02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
the chair of the
 
02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee did I mishear him when he
 
02:33:32.590 --> 02:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
said that he his name is on this
 
02:33:35.070 --> 02:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
amendment but he doesn't support
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
it oh I think you heard him correctly
 
02:33:39.190 --> 02:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
that's correct represent Smith thank you
 
02:33:42.510 --> 02:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
for that that he the plus court cost
 
02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
part is the part that he I think he has
 
02:33:49.269 --> 02:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
a problem any any viol in in my opinion
 
02:33:51.150 --> 02:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
again I'm not a lawyer but any violation
 
02:33:52.750 --> 02:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
of 5
 
02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
540A would allow a tenant to file a
 
02:33:58.469 --> 02:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
petition with no court costs um that's
 
02:34:00.670 --> 02:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
just the way I interpret it I think no
 
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
court costs is it's just it's just not
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
needed so I I don't like to tie the
 
02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
hands of the
 
02:34:10.349 --> 02:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Mr chair could I ask you a pro
 
02:34:12.910 --> 02:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
what your plans are
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
for how long are we going to go here or
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
are we going take a break um uh and come
 
02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
back or are we going to take a break and
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
come back next Wednesday and the reason
 
02:34:30.429 --> 02:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
I ask is before we vote on either the um
 
02:34:33.870 --> 02:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment or the bill I would like to
 
02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
ask um if I could meet with my
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
Democratic colleagues for about five
 
02:34:41.790 --> 02:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
minutes sure you know what would it make
 
02:34:43.309 --> 02:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to take a lunch
 
02:34:45.389 --> 02:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
break that is you're in charge and I
 
02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
follow your lead lead
 
02:34:51.030 --> 02:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
um uh my my inclination would be this is
 
02:34:53.469 --> 02:34:53.479 align:start position:0%
a good time for lunch let's let's take a
 
02:34:57.030 --> 02:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
recess for uh and be back at uh one
 
02:34:59.110 --> 02:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock one o'clock one o'clock all

yes all right so what I'd like to do uh
 
03:31:57.229 --> 03:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
next then is turn um relatively quickly
 
03:32:00.670 --> 03:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 314 because we are not
 
03:32:02.269 --> 03:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
going to be able to take a vote on that
 
03:32:05.070 --> 03:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
bill today because there's some language
 
03:32:09.790 --> 03:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
that would need to be added um that um
 
03:32:14.990 --> 03:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
that OS will not be able to uh draft
 
03:32:15.000 --> 03:32:17.229 align:start position:0%
that OS will not be able to uh draft
um

03:32:17.229 --> 03:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh today so I what I what I'd like to do
 
03:32:28.349 --> 03:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
initially um is to is to make
 
03:32:32.590 --> 03:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
sure is is to tell you what the changes
 
03:32:36.790 --> 03:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
are to propos changes are to this bill
 
03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
from the official Amendment um
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
that was
 
03:32:46.510 --> 03:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh that is
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
amendment 2414 is that correct yes
 
03:32:54.030 --> 03:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
that's 2414 okay so
 
03:32:57.269 --> 03:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:01.110 --> 03:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
changes hang on one second yeah so the
 
03:33:05.590 --> 03:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
changes are um and
 
03:33:07.910 --> 03:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
this the the first change that you're
 
03:33:10.389 --> 03:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
going to see in the official Amendment
 
03:33:10.399 --> 03:33:11.389 align:start position:0%
going to see in the official Amendment
from

03:33:11.389 --> 03:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:33:14.429 --> 03:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
um um
 
03:33:17.309 --> 03:33:17.319 align:start position:0%
the draft that has been circulated among
 
03:33:20.070 --> 03:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee is that entirely
 
03:33:23.469 --> 03:33:23.479 align:start position:0%
appropriately OS put the definition
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
section in alphabetical order in other
 
03:33:28.990 --> 03:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
words the way I had drafted it you know
 
03:33:31.710 --> 03:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
personal information was was was the
 
03:33:33.630 --> 03:33:33.640 align:start position:0%
first term that was
 
03:33:37.990 --> 03:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
identified um and it went on whereas OS
 
03:33:40.630 --> 03:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
appropriately listed the definition the
 
03:33:42.070 --> 03:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
the the terms to be defined in
 
03:33:44.590 --> 03:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
alphabetical order so for example
 
03:33:47.389 --> 03:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
available to the public comes first
 
03:33:49.229 --> 03:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
government entity second personal
 
03:33:51.429 --> 03:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
information third and thirdparty
 
03:33:56.349 --> 03:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
provider comes last um that uh that's a
 
03:33:58.670 --> 03:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
change that is made in
 
03:34:02.510 --> 03:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
the uh uh in the official draft which I
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
would propose that that remain the same
 
03:34:08.189 --> 03:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
because that's just the you know the
 
03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
practice that is used by uh by the
 
03:34:15.710 --> 03:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
legislature in defining terms um the
 
03:34:17.590 --> 03:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
next thing that you will
 
03:34:23.070 --> 03:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:25.269 --> 03:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:34:25.279 --> 03:34:28.550 align:start position:0%
um the
um

03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:28.560 --> 03:34:31.710 align:start position:0%
 
insection

03:34:31.710 --> 03:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:35.990 --> 03:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
507 H2 I'm sorry I should back up you
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
will see that in the the draft that I
 
03:34:41.910 --> 03:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
have circulated I have referred to this
 
03:34:45.389 --> 03:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:48.150 --> 03:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
507-i whereas the official draft refers
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
to it as 507 DH and you may you may be
 
03:34:54.590 --> 03:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
asking yourself oh wait a minute we just
 
03:34:59.189 --> 03:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
passed 255 that's also labeled as 507 DH
 
03:35:01.309 --> 03:35:01.319 align:start position:0%
how can you have two different chapters
 
03:35:03.269 --> 03:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
that have the same number and the reason
 
03:35:06.630 --> 03:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
is again aols
 
03:35:09.550 --> 03:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
appropriately the next available chapter
 
03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
in 507 is H and since the legisl OS
 
03:35:17.229 --> 03:35:17.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't know that 507 that 255 is going
 
03:35:20.710 --> 03:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
to pass if it doesn't this this would be
 
03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
H if it if 50 if 255 does pass then this
 
03:35:27.429 --> 03:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
will they can just change this to I so
 
03:35:30.750 --> 03:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
just so you so you know that um the
 
03:35:30.760 --> 03:35:31.670 align:start position:0%
just so you so you know that um the
other

03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.600 --> 03:35:45.269 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:35:45.269 --> 03:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:47.950 --> 03:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
no you have the official but I've been
 
03:35:52.030 --> 03:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
i' yes but the chair is not working on
 
03:35:56.590 --> 03:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:58.990 --> 03:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
right no
 
03:36:01.269 --> 03:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
what what
 
03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry this we're going we're
 
03:36:05.469 --> 03:36:05.479 align:start position:0%
going to teach the chair that he should
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
put his name and the date always
 
03:36:12.950 --> 03:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's it it it looks it doesn't look
 
03:36:15.070 --> 03:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
like an official one because it's not
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
looks like this right it begins by
 
03:36:21.309 --> 03:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
saying amend HP 314 by replacing all to
 
03:36:24.189 --> 03:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
the enacting cluse with the following
 
03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
right yeah no I'm you're you're
 
03:36:27.510 --> 03:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely right I should have done that
 
03:36:30.070 --> 03:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
and I didn't uh and I apologize for
 
03:36:33.910 --> 03:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
that don't need but I'm let me but as I
 
03:36:36.710 --> 03:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
let me let me go through then and say
 
03:36:36.720 --> 03:36:37.950 align:start position:0%
let me let me go through then and say
the

03:36:37.950 --> 03:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:37.960 --> 03:36:39.469 align:start position:0%
the
only

03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:36:42.309 --> 03:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:36:45.630 --> 03:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
only substantive
 
03:36:49.469 --> 03:36:49.479 align:start position:0%
changes from the official Amendment are
 
03:36:51.229 --> 03:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
the one I just referred to you about
 
03:36:53.790 --> 03:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
putting the putting the uh the
 
03:36:56.070 --> 03:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
definitions in alphabetical order
 
03:37:00.550 --> 03:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
renaming ruming the chapter from 507 I
 
03:37:04.910 --> 03:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
to 507 H for the reasons I just said um
 
03:37:08.309 --> 03:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
there is another
 
03:37:13.110 --> 03:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:16.309 --> 03:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
um let me make sure that I've got this
 
03:37:21.630 --> 03:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:24.750 --> 03:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
that I I propose
 
03:37:24.760 --> 03:37:27.950 align:start position:0%
that I I propose
making

03:37:27.950 --> 03:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:33.110 --> 03:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
to 314 is in 507
 
03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:36.830 align:start position:0%
to 314 is in 507
H2

03:37:36.830 --> 03:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:51.510 --> 03:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
right by adding in the second sentence
 
03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
of H2 the one that
 
03:37:56.830 --> 03:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
begins um an individ the one that begins
 
03:37:59.870 --> 03:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh third-party providers of information
 
03:37:59.880 --> 03:38:00.710 align:start position:0%
uh third-party providers of information
and

03:38:00.710 --> 03:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:03.510 --> 03:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
services I would begin I would add to
 
03:38:06.269 --> 03:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
that in the as a as a introductory
 
03:38:10.150 --> 03:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph unless specifically authorized
 
03:38:11.309 --> 03:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
by by
 
03:38:14.429 --> 03:38:14.439 align:start position:0%
law third party providers of information
 
03:38:17.189 --> 03:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
shall not uh and that's
 
03:38:19.990 --> 03:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
because um
 
03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
the a number of people have informed us
 
03:38:27.750 --> 03:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
that there are there may be various
 
03:38:31.389 --> 03:38:31.399 align:start position:0%
statutes that
 
03:38:35.710 --> 03:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
specifically um authorize or in some
 
03:38:39.750 --> 03:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
cases even direct um uh third- party
 
03:38:41.790 --> 03:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
providers to provide to disclose
 
03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
information in certain circumstances and
 
03:38:46.630 --> 03:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to run a foul of
 
03:38:49.309 --> 03:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
that the other
 
03:38:53.389 --> 03:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
change that um is a substantive change
 
03:38:55.870 --> 03:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
is you'll notice in the official version
 
03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
it has three exceptions in to to when uh
 
03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me could you cite the page and
 
03:39:03.510 --> 03:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
the not line
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
number sure on so on on page on from the
 
03:39:11.550 --> 03:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
official draft on page
 
03:39:13.950 --> 03:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
one it would be line
 
03:39:17.469 --> 03:39:17.479 align:start position:0%
29 the sentence that begins thirdparty
 
03:39:19.590 --> 03:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
providers there would be added to the
 
03:39:22.349 --> 03:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
beginning of that sentence the words
 
03:39:25.309 --> 03:39:25.319 align:start position:0%
unless specifically authorized by law
 
03:39:26.590 --> 03:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of the sentence would
 
03:39:29.429 --> 03:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
go on to read the way it does the next
 
03:39:31.950 --> 03:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
change that would be made
 
03:39:34.269 --> 03:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:39:37.550 --> 03:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
that you'll see that then that on the on
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
page two of the official draft there are
 
03:39:39.479 --> 03:39:42.790 align:start position:0%
page two of the official draft there are
three

03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:45.309 --> 03:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
exceptions a such individuals have given
 
03:39:47.950 --> 03:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
explicit consent B emergency situations
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
and three the information is disclosed
 
03:39:53.670 --> 03:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
in accordance with RSA 507
 
03:39:53.680 --> 03:39:56.990 align:start position:0%
in accordance with RSA 507
H3

03:39:56.990 --> 03:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:00.630 --> 03:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
now one of the things that some some of
 
03:40:02.070 --> 03:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
the people that are interested in this
 
03:40:05.070 --> 03:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
bill have um
 
03:40:11.710 --> 03:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
said is um that if that that
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
um there may be that it's customary now
 
03:40:17.870 --> 03:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
let me put it that way it's customary
 
03:40:17.880 --> 03:40:19.510 align:start position:0%
let me put it that way it's customary
now

03:40:19.510 --> 03:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:40:22.189 --> 03:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
for various entities that would be
 
03:40:25.710 --> 03:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
covered by three4 by this bill that is
 
03:40:28.590 --> 03:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
utilities for example banks credit card
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
companies it's customary now for those
 
03:40:36.429 --> 03:40:36.439 align:start position:0%
institutions on their own initiative if
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
they have information that there's that
 
03:40:42.510 --> 03:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
there's you know some fraud or some
 
03:40:44.550 --> 03:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
crime being committed or that somebody
 
03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
is being harassed or that there's some
 
03:40:50.670 --> 03:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
some other kind of illegal activity they
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
will now on their own disclose
 
03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
information to to sort of you know
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
attempt to uh bring that to light or
 
03:41:04.229 --> 03:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
counter uh somebody being hurt by that
 
03:41:05.910 --> 03:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
they may disclose that information to
 
03:41:07.950 --> 03:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
the customer in question did you know
 
03:41:10.110 --> 03:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
that you know your credit card was just
 
03:41:14.550 --> 03:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
being used by um uh this person or that
 
03:41:16.670 --> 03:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
person or they might disclose it to law
 
03:41:16.680 --> 03:41:19.469 align:start position:0%
person or they might disclose it to law
enforcement

03:41:19.469 --> 03:41:19.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:41:25.830 --> 03:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.070 --> 03:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
fourth uh exception under in other words
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
it would be a uh a b c and d and I would
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
actually in insert what I'm about to
 
03:41:41.189 --> 03:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
tell you as C and May and make uh
 
03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
make the the the one that now reads the
 
03:41:45.710 --> 03:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
information is disclosed in accordance
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
with RSA 507 H3 I would make that
 
03:41:51.510 --> 03:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
subsection D and
 
03:41:56.309 --> 03:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
for um C I would add the language that
 
03:41:56.319 --> 03:42:00.349 align:start position:0%
for um C I would add the language that
says

03:42:00.349 --> 03:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:00.359 --> 03:42:02.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:42:02.429 --> 03:42:02.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:07.469 --> 03:42:07.479 align:start position:0%
uh to prevent to prevent detect protect
 
03:42:11.469 --> 03:42:11.479 align:start position:0%
against or respond to fraud identity
 
03:42:11.479 --> 03:42:12.710 align:start position:0%
against or respond to fraud identity
theft

03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
theft
 
03:42:15.630 --> 03:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
harassment uh or malicious deceptive or
 
03:42:15.640 --> 03:42:16.990 align:start position:0%
harassment uh or malicious deceptive or
illegal

03:42:16.990 --> 03:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
03:42:20.149 --> 03:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
activity um so I would add
 
03:42:24.870 --> 03:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
that and then the last um the last CH
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
substantive change is in
 
03:42:28.800 --> 03:42:31.990 align:start position:0%
substantive change is in
507

03:42:31.990 --> 03:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
H3 Roman numeral
 
03:42:37.070 --> 03:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
two and
 
03:42:37.080 --> 03:42:38.950 align:start position:0%
two and
three

03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:42:42.389 --> 03:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
um the changes that I would make there I
 
03:42:43.710 --> 03:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the reason they
 
03:42:45.110 --> 03:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
weren't included is that these were
 
03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
changes that I that we came up with or I
 
03:42:49.910 --> 03:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
came up with and our subcommittee came
 
03:42:52.189 --> 03:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
up with after this was submitted to OS
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
for drafting it
 
03:42:58.590 --> 03:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
says it
 
03:43:03.309 --> 03:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
establishes certain limitations on what
 
03:43:06.670 --> 03:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
information can be the timing of the
 
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
disclosure of certain information so for
 
03:43:12.790 --> 03:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
example if it says that when
 
03:43:14.750 --> 03:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
information when a government entity
 
03:43:16.710 --> 03:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
seeks the disclosure of personal
 
03:43:21.269 --> 03:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
information either pursuant to um a
 
03:43:26.590 --> 03:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
request or a uh demand based on a
 
03:43:30.790 --> 03:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
subpoena the The Entity the the covered
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
provider that gets that
 
03:43:35.309 --> 03:43:35.319 align:start position:0%
information can't provide the
 
03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
information to whoever's whatever the
 
03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
governmental entity that is that's
 
03:43:41.550 --> 03:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
requesting it they can't provide it for
 
03:43:41.560 --> 03:43:42.910 align:start position:0%
requesting it they can't provide it for
10

03:43:42.910 --> 03:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
10
 
03:43:46.950 --> 03:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
days and within five days of getting the
 
03:43:50.070 --> 03:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
request they're required to disclose the
 
03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
fact that they've gotten the
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
request to the person whose information
 
03:43:56.189 --> 03:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
it pertains to so in other words if the
 
03:43:59.269 --> 03:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
bank issues a subpoena to me I mean if
 
03:44:01.469 --> 03:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
the uh if if the government issues a
 
03:44:04.750 --> 03:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
subpoena to my bank for my bank records
 
03:44:09.309 --> 03:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
um the bank can't comply for 10 days and
 
03:44:11.469 --> 03:44:11.479 align:start position:0%
within five days the bank has to notify
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
me saying but you know by the way Bob uh
 
03:44:16.189 --> 03:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
you know the county attorney's office
 
03:44:19.349 --> 03:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
issued suboo or the
 
03:44:22.149 --> 03:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
the Securities Department issued a
 
03:44:24.990 --> 03:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
subpoena for your records and the idea
 
03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
of that is that I will then have five
 
03:44:29.790 --> 03:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
days if I think that there's a basis to
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
quash The subpoena for me to to go to
 
03:44:37.070 --> 03:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
court to move to kashan the exception to
 
03:44:39.710 --> 03:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
that would be if the government
 
03:44:41.389 --> 03:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
governmental entity and this happens
 
03:44:43.149 --> 03:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
with some frequency if the governmental
 
03:44:43.159 --> 03:44:44.349 align:start position:0%
with some frequency if the governmental
entity

03:44:44.349 --> 03:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
entity
 
03:44:50.269 --> 03:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
says um to the to the uh to my bank in
 
03:44:53.990 --> 03:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
my example don't tell Lynn that we've
 
03:44:56.309 --> 03:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
that we've issued this subpoena and here
 
03:44:59.269 --> 03:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
is our Authority for us to De to demand
 
03:45:01.389 --> 03:45:01.399 align:start position:0%
that you not do that or if they have a
 
03:45:03.229 --> 03:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
court order that says don't do that and
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
and again uh that that is something that
 
03:45:09.429 --> 03:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
happens with some frequency but unless
 
03:45:12.030 --> 03:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
the the governmental entity had that
 
03:45:14.670 --> 03:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
made that request the bank would be
 
03:45:15.910 --> 03:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
required to
 
03:45:19.189 --> 03:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
disclose within that 5day
 
03:45:21.750 --> 03:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
period subsection
 
03:45:24.070 --> 03:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
three which
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
is which is new this is not included in
 
03:45:29.710 --> 03:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
the official draft but Roman numeral
 
03:45:34.269 --> 03:45:34.279 align:start position:0%
this would be 507 H3 Roman numeral
 
03:45:38.070 --> 03:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
3 this again is a notice requirement but
 
03:45:40.830 --> 03:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
it deals with what notice
 
03:45:45.070 --> 03:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
the um has to be given by the The Entity
 
03:45:47.870 --> 03:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
that receives a government request in
 
03:45:51.149 --> 03:45:51.159 align:start position:0%
the case of if it's either a if the if
 
03:45:55.710 --> 03:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
the demand for information is either uh
 
03:45:57.750 --> 03:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
occurs in an emergency
 
03:46:00.429 --> 03:46:00.439 align:start position:0%
situation or it
 
03:46:03.710 --> 03:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
occurs uh pursuant to a search War
 
03:46:06.910 --> 03:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
because unlike a unlike a subp in an
 
03:46:09.189 --> 03:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
emergency self it's sort of self- evant
 
03:46:09.199 --> 03:46:10.149 align:start position:0%
emergency self it's sort of self- evant
but

03:46:10.149 --> 03:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:46:11.710 --> 03:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
with the in the case of a search warrant
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
unlike a subpoena a search warrant
 
03:46:16.870 --> 03:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't say
 
03:46:19.550 --> 03:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
to the person that the warrant is served
 
03:46:22.830 --> 03:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
on it doesn't say please provide this
 
03:46:25.349 --> 03:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
information you know either like right
 
03:46:28.070 --> 03:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
away or tomorrow or whatever it says in
 
03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
effect we're taking this information
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
from it's a seizure it say it basically
 
03:46:35.070 --> 03:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
says that the government is seizing this
 
03:46:37.990 --> 03:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
information so there's no there's no
 
03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity in those situations for an
 
03:46:43.229 --> 03:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
advanced notice but what paragraph 3
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
would say is in those circumstances you
 
03:46:47.349 --> 03:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
have to give at least contemporaneous
 
03:46:49.510 --> 03:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
notice in other words the bank has if
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
the bank gets a search warrant for my
 
03:46:54.149 --> 03:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
records they have to
 
03:46:56.389 --> 03:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously provide notice to me
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
that they' that they've you know been
 
03:46:59.790 --> 03:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
served with a search warrant again with
 
03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
the caveat that if the if there's a
 
03:47:05.630 --> 03:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
court order or the or the whoever's
 
03:47:07.870 --> 03:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
obtained the search War has legal
 
03:47:10.389 --> 03:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
authority to demand that no disclosure
 
03:47:12.910 --> 03:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
be made then that's okay but there has
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
unless there's that Authority the uh the
 
03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
information has to be
 
03:47:17.439 --> 03:47:19.349 align:start position:0%
information has to be
provided

03:47:19.349 --> 03:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
provided
 
03:47:22.389 --> 03:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
um so that's those those are the
 
03:47:25.149 --> 03:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
substantive differences from from the
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
version that I uh that I drafted and the
 
03:47:31.189 --> 03:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
official Amendment and so I guess what
 
03:47:33.630 --> 03:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do is have a discuss
 
03:47:35.830 --> 03:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
basically say does anybody I think these
 
03:47:38.229 --> 03:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
are designed to provide more privacy
 
03:47:40.590 --> 03:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
protection to to
 
03:47:44.550 --> 03:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know than than the the official
 
03:47:48.030 --> 03:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment version and so um I throw it
 
03:47:50.550 --> 03:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
out for if people have questions or
 
03:47:56.790 --> 03:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:58.870 --> 03:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
this I I just have a question about
 
03:48:01.149 --> 03:48:01.159 align:start position:0%
process how does a contemporaneously
 
03:48:03.550 --> 03:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
notice if if you've got a search warrant
 
03:48:05.469 --> 03:48:05.479 align:start position:0%
is that before you allow them to come in
 
03:48:07.389 --> 03:48:07.399 align:start position:0%
or right as you're allowing them to I
 
03:48:09.269 --> 03:48:09.279 align:start position:0%
think it's I think it's basically as
 
03:48:11.030 --> 03:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah no I think it would be yeah I think
 
03:48:12.910 --> 03:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
it would be because as I say a search
 
03:48:15.469 --> 03:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
basically a search right would be sort
 
03:48:17.910 --> 03:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
of right soon as the first opportunity
 
03:48:20.590 --> 03:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
when you know either while or after the
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
warrant is being
 
03:48:25.710 --> 03:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
served um and I think that makes I think
 
03:48:28.229 --> 03:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
that makes sense now this you know this
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
makes it a little harder on frankly on
 
03:48:32.189 --> 03:48:32.199 align:start position:0%
on some prosecutors it may make it a
 
03:48:36.550 --> 03:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
little harder for them uh uh you know
 
03:48:38.030 --> 03:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
they may have to they may have to jump
 
03:48:39.710 --> 03:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
through some hoops that they wouldn't
 
03:48:41.830 --> 03:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't jump through and other uh
 
03:48:43.550 --> 03:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
under other without this bill but I
 
03:48:44.710 --> 03:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
03:48:47.389 --> 03:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
it's as as somebody who spent a lot lot
 
03:48:48.670 --> 03:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
of time as a prosecutor I don't think
 
03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's an undue it's an undue burden and I
 
03:48:52.830 --> 03:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
think it does provide additional
 
03:48:57.830 --> 03:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
protection for for privacy interest so I
 
03:49:00.269 --> 03:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
what I would propose then is unless be
 
03:49:02.550 --> 03:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
unless somebody has an objection I would
 
03:49:05.590 --> 03:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
ask I will ask ol between now and next
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
week to make the changes I've just
 
03:49:09.510 --> 03:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
discussed and we can then vote on
 
03:49:10.550 --> 03:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
obviously I don't expect you to vote
 
03:49:12.389 --> 03:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
without seeing the actual language I
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
will have have that um uh next week do
 
03:49:19.790 --> 03:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:22.269 --> 03:49:22.279 align:start position:0%
everybody good all right thanks I think
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
we're I think we're done
 
03:49:27.469 --> 03:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
um oh no we're going no no no we're
 
03:49:30.510 --> 03:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
going to 396 next we're going to 396
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
next um all right so
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
now um I would like to turn to uh HB
 
03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
396 and um I would
 
03:49:48.309 --> 03:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
recognize uh representative Perez I
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
understand you have an amendment do you
 
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
have that in front of you if you don't I
 
03:49:53.830 --> 03:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
have it here okay all right great so I
 
03:49:58.950 --> 03:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
441 representative Perez this is the
 
03:50:04.990 --> 03:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that I put before you way back
 
03:50:08.349 --> 03:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
so that's why it has on it 2023 so it
 
03:50:09.870 --> 03:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
has not been changed
 
03:50:15.030 --> 03:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
since then um I feel that this before
 
03:50:16.510 --> 03:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
before you speak to it we need a second
 
03:50:19.070 --> 03:50:19.080 align:start position:0%

03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
second okay I move to ought to pass
 
03:50:24.479 --> 03:50:26.309 align:start position:0%
second okay I move to ought to pass
Amendment

03:50:26.309 --> 03:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:50:26.319 --> 03:50:28.630 align:start position:0%
Amendment
2023

03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
2023
 
03:50:33.189 --> 03:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
04418 a second okay are we ready yes you
 
03:50:35.830 --> 03:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
may I speak to so it hasn't been changed
 
03:50:39.030 --> 03:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
since it was presented last year and um
 
03:50:40.710 --> 03:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
but in spite of the fact that it hasn't
 
03:50:40.720 --> 03:50:41.550 align:start position:0%
but in spite of the fact that it hasn't
been

03:50:41.550 --> 03:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:50:44.950 --> 03:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
changed um I've done a lot of research
 
03:50:49.990 --> 03:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
and um a lot of talking and um to people
 
03:50:51.990 --> 03:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
and there's been a lot of issues that
 
03:50:53.830 --> 03:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
have been brought to me and brought out
 
03:50:56.950 --> 03:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the public that support this but
 
03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
originally having been a intensive care
 
03:51:03.429 --> 03:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
and an ER nurse one of the first things
 
03:51:06.189 --> 03:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
that came to my mind about biological
 
03:51:09.830 --> 03:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
sex is basically
 
03:51:12.349 --> 03:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
you there are different lab values
 
03:51:15.790 --> 03:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
different all kinds of different things
 
03:51:19.070 --> 03:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
for a biological male and a biological
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
female that are taken into consideration
 
03:51:24.189 --> 03:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
in an emergency room because your lab
 
03:51:26.429 --> 03:51:26.439 align:start position:0%
values are different all kinds of things
 
03:51:26.439 --> 03:51:27.269 align:start position:0%
values are different all kinds of things
are

03:51:27.269 --> 03:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:51:29.550 --> 03:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
different but I'm going to tell you the
 
03:51:32.070 --> 03:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
same thing that I said to you back then
 
03:51:35.389 --> 03:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
why I feel this is very important um one
 
03:51:38.750 --> 03:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
of the things I've had multiple parents
 
03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
come to to me uh urinary tract
 
03:51:43.349 --> 03:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
infections for young girls who won't use
 
03:51:46.950 --> 03:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
bathrooms there was just a big article
 
03:51:49.309 --> 03:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
um that was sent out about a young girl
 
03:51:51.870 --> 03:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
who had her facial fractures and her
 
03:51:55.469 --> 03:51:55.479 align:start position:0%
teeth all knocked out in a field hockey
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
game um we've seen all kinds of
 
03:52:03.269 --> 03:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
incidents where um female um
 
03:52:06.309 --> 03:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
incarcerated have become pregnant there
 
03:52:06.319 --> 03:52:07.510 align:start position:0%
incarcerated have become pregnant there
are

03:52:07.510 --> 03:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances that
 
03:52:12.710 --> 03:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
would it would be in the best interest
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:52:17.830 --> 03:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
individual to be using their biological
 
03:52:22.550 --> 03:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
born sex with I don't think that it I
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
have nothing against any
 
03:52:31.910 --> 03:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
lgbtq any gender identity I have nothing
 
03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
against any of that but I do feel that
 
03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
when we're talking according to the
 
03:52:46.670 --> 03:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
um according to the intersect Society of
 
03:52:50.670 --> 03:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
America we're talking about a minority
 
03:52:54.309 --> 03:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
of people who have rights and their
 
03:52:56.349 --> 03:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
rights need to be respected and not be
 
03:52:56.359 --> 03:52:57.790 align:start position:0%
rights need to be respected and not be
discriminated

03:52:57.790 --> 03:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
discriminated
 
03:53:01.790 --> 03:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
against but we have to consider the fact
 
03:53:04.990 --> 03:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
that we live
 
03:53:06.910 --> 03:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
in a
 
03:53:09.910 --> 03:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
government where the Maj majority of the
 
03:53:11.469 --> 03:53:11.479 align:start position:0%
people need to be taken into
 
03:53:14.910 --> 03:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
consideration as well and you cannot
 
03:53:18.269 --> 03:53:18.279 align:start position:0%
provide equity for 100% of the people at
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
100% of the time but we need to
 
03:53:27.309 --> 03:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
provide equity for we need to provide
 
03:53:31.229 --> 03:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
safety dignity respect and
 
03:53:35.469 --> 03:53:35.479 align:start position:0%
privacy for the minority I mean for the
 
03:53:39.149 --> 03:53:39.159 align:start position:0%
majority especially in sensitive situ
 
03:53:43.510 --> 03:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
situations safety is a huge issue if I
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
am a
 
03:53:50.510 --> 03:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
female going into a female bathroom
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
because I am a female and identify as a
 
03:53:56.550 --> 03:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
female I can't change the bathroom that
 
03:54:01.110 --> 03:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
I go into but if I am identified as a
 
03:54:04.110 --> 03:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
female I can change the bathroom that I
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
go into perhaps a private bathroom in
 
03:54:10.229 --> 03:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
the schools perhaps the nurses that's
 
03:54:13.189 --> 03:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
not taking that's not discriminating
 
03:54:15.990 --> 03:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
against them that's providing equal
 
03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
safety for everyone
 
03:54:22.309 --> 03:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
involved I just feel very strongly that
 
03:54:23.830 --> 03:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:54:27.309 --> 03:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances um where people need to be
 
03:54:29.349 --> 03:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
protected and you know I
 
03:54:32.110 --> 03:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
always I wonder
 
03:54:36.030 --> 03:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
why why people are against this if
 
03:54:39.550 --> 03:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
anything um one of the big issues
 
03:54:41.950 --> 03:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
women are being discriminated against in
 
03:54:45.189 --> 03:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
sports women are being discriminated
 
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
against the girls basketball team is
 
03:54:50.030 --> 03:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against doesn't
 
03:54:52.269 --> 03:54:52.279 align:start position:0%
anybody see that's a form of
 
03:54:55.070 --> 03:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
discriminating against them this is to
 
03:54:58.750 --> 03:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
protect discrimination it's not to
 
03:55:02.950 --> 03:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
hurt any one particular group it's to
 
03:55:06.030 --> 03:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
provide safety
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%

anyone else wish to be heard on uh
 
03:55:13.080 --> 03:55:15.990 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on uh
Amendment

03:55:15.990 --> 03:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:18.229 --> 03:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
441 representative hardan did you wish
 
03:55:19.870 --> 03:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:55:22.750 --> 03:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
heard I'll
 
03:55:25.910 --> 03:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
pass all right um all right so see
 
03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
nobody else I I guess I
 
03:55:32.070 --> 03:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
would what I would say is I think I've
 
03:55:34.149 --> 03:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
said this before and I'll I'll try to
 
03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
keep it very brief I think that this
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
that this is an appropriate amendment I
 
03:55:44.429 --> 03:55:44.439 align:start position:0%
think for I I I agree with
 
03:55:46.229 --> 03:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
representative Perez and I think it's
 
03:55:49.469 --> 03:55:49.479 align:start position:0%
important to point out that a couple
 
03:55:51.630 --> 03:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
things first of all this is not a
 
03:55:55.070 --> 03:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
command to anybody this doesn't direct
 
03:55:58.349 --> 03:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say that prisons for
 
03:56:01.469 --> 03:56:01.479 align:start position:0%
example must do this must classify on
 
03:56:04.149 --> 03:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
the basis of biological sex it doesn't
 
03:56:08.349 --> 03:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
say that um schools must classify on the
 
03:56:10.750 --> 03:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
basis of biological sex with with regard
 
03:56:13.830 --> 03:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
to restrooms it doesn't say that they
 
03:56:16.710 --> 03:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
must classify on the basis of biological
 
03:56:18.790 --> 03:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
sex with respect to sporting
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
competitions in which uh biological sex
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
is kind of recognized to make a a
 
03:56:26.870 --> 03:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
difference to Performance it just gives
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to do that without
 
03:56:32.269 --> 03:56:32.279 align:start position:0%
having it claimed that they've violated
 
03:56:35.229 --> 03:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
the Civil the the Civil Rights Act and I
 
03:56:37.389 --> 03:56:37.399 align:start position:0%
would point out as I I think I've said
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
before that it's really important to
 
03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
remember that unlike for example racial
 
03:56:49.030 --> 03:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
classifications with regard to sexual
 
03:56:51.710 --> 03:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
classifications it it is a reality that
 
03:56:54.870 --> 03:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
some level of separate but equal is
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
really allowed if if that wasn't the
 
03:56:58.590 --> 03:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
case you wouldn't have Title Nine would
 
03:56:58.600 --> 03:56:59.349 align:start position:0%
case you wouldn't have Title Nine would
be

03:56:59.349 --> 03:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:57:02.189 --> 03:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because it it provides
 
03:57:05.429 --> 03:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
you don't that you have you have equal
 
03:57:07.189 --> 03:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity for women for example in
 
03:57:09.510 --> 03:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
sports but it doesn't say that women get
 
03:57:11.950 --> 03:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
to play on the boys's football team or
 
03:57:14.070 --> 03:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
that there can't be two football teams
 
03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry two basketball teams or two
 
03:57:18.429 --> 03:57:18.439 align:start position:0%
baseball teams or whatever there can be
 
03:57:22.990 --> 03:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
and that in itself is not a violation of
 
03:57:26.510 --> 03:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh of of federal law of uh the
 
03:57:30.349 --> 03:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution so I think that these are
 
03:57:33.990 --> 03:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
three very narrow circumstances in which
 
03:57:37.030 --> 03:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
it does make sense to classify on the
 
03:57:39.269 --> 03:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
basis of biological sex
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
I think um most of the public would
 
03:57:45.229 --> 03:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
agree that it makes sense in these
 
03:57:48.590 --> 03:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
limited situations to do that um and so
 
03:57:52.550 --> 03:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
I I uh strongly support this
 
03:57:56.950 --> 03:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
amendment other yes representative
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chairman um your
 
03:58:03.309 --> 03:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
comments about separate but equal I
 
03:58:07.149 --> 03:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
found very interesting in terms of uh
 
03:58:09.790 --> 03:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
trying to differentiate
 
03:58:12.429 --> 03:58:12.439 align:start position:0%
um uh you know the difference
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
differences in terms of of sex or gender
 
03:58:17.429 --> 03:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
whichever we're talking about at the
 
03:58:22.630 --> 03:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
moment from race um religion other
 
03:58:25.149 --> 03:58:25.159 align:start position:0%
things and I thought that's you you gave
 
03:58:27.389 --> 03:58:27.399 align:start position:0%
me something to think about but when you
 
03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
move to Title Nine um that's where I
 
03:58:34.550 --> 03:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
lose you because the reason for Title
 
03:58:38.950 --> 03:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
Nine wasn't for separate but equal it
 
03:58:42.030 --> 03:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
was because the practice that was
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
consistent across the country was that
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
we use public funds or not but what I
 
03:58:52.710 --> 03:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
care about are public funds for example
 
03:58:58.870 --> 03:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
in schools in other bodies um to provide
 
03:59:02.870 --> 03:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
athletic opportunities for men but not
 
03:59:07.269 --> 03:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
for women so the purpose of Title 9
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't to say that there had to be
 
03:59:15.429 --> 03:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
separate opportunities for women it was
 
03:59:19.070 --> 03:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
to say there had to be opportunities for
 
03:59:24.510 --> 03:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
women um and that is I think
 
03:59:26.670 --> 03:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
differentiates from
 
03:59:30.429 --> 03:59:30.439 align:start position:0%
your um the separate but equal General
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
and from why we have Title Nine I
 
03:59:36.469 --> 03:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
disagree with you um
 
03:59:38.830 --> 03:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't think either one one of us
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
will be able to prove the correctness of
 
03:59:45.830 --> 03:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
our position when you say that most
 
03:59:48.790 --> 03:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
people would agree with you I think the
 
03:59:53.429 --> 03:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
answer is possibly that most
 
03:59:56.269 --> 03:59:56.279 align:start position:0%
people really don't care at all they're
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
not thinking about it at all and they
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily think they have to
 
04:00:05.990 --> 04:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
think about it all um about how someone
 
04:00:08.950 --> 04:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
who chooses to identify
 
04:00:13.229 --> 04:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
in one way should be allowed to live
 
04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
that person's life I think G
 
04:00:17.189 --> 04:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
particularly in the Hampshire
 
04:00:19.590 --> 04:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
historically you know we were a we are a
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
Libertarian state where we try to say
 
04:00:24.110 --> 04:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
that the government should stay out of
 
04:00:27.229 --> 04:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
private lives out of the business of of
 
04:00:32.269 --> 04:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
of private lives so I think that us
 
04:00:36.389 --> 04:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
deciding that in one or in your case I
 
04:00:39.309 --> 04:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
think three cases it would be okay but
 
04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
not in others is beside the point I
 
04:00:43.990 --> 04:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
think we should
 
04:00:47.710 --> 04:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
just not pursue this matter I don't know
 
04:00:50.590 --> 04:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
about the rest of you and it is true I
 
04:00:53.510 --> 04:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
come from Durham and I acknowledge that
 
04:00:55.110 --> 04:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
I have
 
04:00:57.189 --> 04:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
never received a
 
04:01:02.030 --> 04:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
call from anyone in my district or when
 
04:01:06.070 --> 04:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
I represented Madbury same thing um and
 
04:01:08.910 --> 04:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any one of my colleagues
 
04:01:10.710 --> 04:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
other than
 
04:01:15.349 --> 04:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative Perez who has received
 
04:01:18.269 --> 04:01:18.279 align:start position:0%
many calls from people who are offended
 
04:01:22.030 --> 04:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
by this so I think we have enough things
 
04:01:25.269 --> 04:01:25.279 align:start position:0%
to worry about where no one else is can
 
04:01:28.309 --> 04:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
step in accept government in this case I
 
04:01:30.670 --> 04:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
think we can leave people to live their
 
04:01:30.680 --> 04:01:32.429 align:start position:0%
think we can leave people to live their
own

04:01:32.429 --> 04:01:32.439 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
lives uh representative hon um yes um I
 
04:01:40.030 --> 04:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
think uh you mentioned uh you mentioned
 
04:01:43.110 --> 04:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
Sports in particular so uh Sports all
 
04:01:45.189 --> 04:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
the sports competitions in New Hampshire
 
04:01:47.710 --> 04:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
are you know they're some independent
 
04:01:49.110 --> 04:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
body that regulates them even the
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
intercol actic sports there in Hampshire
 
04:01:53.149 --> 04:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
interaccial Sports Association which is
 
04:01:54.710 --> 04:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
a private organization although most of
 
04:01:57.510 --> 04:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
his members are are uh Public Schools
 
04:02:00.309 --> 04:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
you mentioned girls on the football team
 
04:02:02.309 --> 04:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
um girls have been playing on not many
 
04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
girls but a few on um football teams for
 
04:02:08.590 --> 04:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
for many years I think we' even had a
 
04:02:11.550 --> 04:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
gentleman came in who I forget what if
 
04:02:14.349 --> 04:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
he did play division 3 college football
 
04:02:16.469 --> 04:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
he even he mentioned that and he was
 
04:02:18.510 --> 04:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
actually in favor of this bill but he
 
04:02:20.710 --> 04:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
did say that he one of the teams he
 
04:02:21.790 --> 04:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
played against when he was in high
 
04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
school did have a girl on the team and
 
04:02:25.149 --> 04:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
he seemed to think we he seemed to
 
04:02:26.870 --> 04:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
complain that she was not a good player
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
which uh she was probably the best
 
04:02:29.950 --> 04:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
player they had because that's the coach
 
04:02:32.349 --> 04:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
put him in so I think U that
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
particularly sporting competitions that
 
04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
should be the competitions out a case by
 
04:02:38.750 --> 04:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
case they should decide and I think all
 
04:02:40.429 --> 04:02:40.439 align:start position:0%
of them Pally in a women's sport you
 
04:02:42.429 --> 04:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
have to at least you know your gender
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
identity has to be sincerely female so
 
04:02:48.750 --> 04:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
there's language in that so that's uh as
 
04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
for the thing of Massachusetts I don't
 
04:02:51.550 --> 04:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
know much about it except people making
 
04:02:55.149 --> 04:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
fun of it on Twitter but that's uh that
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
probably that's an unfortunate thing
 
04:02:58.990 --> 04:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
that probably could have happened even
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
if a uh you know a uh CIS female player
 
04:03:06.389 --> 04:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
hit hit that player hard enough in the
 
04:03:09.149 --> 04:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
mouth or if a male player had hitting a
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
male player hard enough in the mouse
 
04:03:12.070 --> 04:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's I mean they have mouth guards
 
04:03:13.389 --> 04:03:13.399 align:start position:0%
protect against that but they weren't
 
04:03:16.990 --> 04:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
100% effectiv I don't know if the gender
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
of the person is
 
04:03:21.389 --> 04:03:21.399 align:start position:0%
uh you know the I don't know whether the
 
04:03:22.990 --> 04:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
so-called biological sex the other
 
04:03:24.510 --> 04:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
player had much to do with it I mean
 
04:03:26.550 --> 04:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
certainly we are going to here in the
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
floor debate I'm sure that um we're
 
04:03:31.710 --> 04:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
going to be treated the information that
 
04:03:35.149 --> 04:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh men are often larger than physically
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
larger than women but some women are
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
physically larger than other women too
 
04:03:40.910 --> 04:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
so that's uh some men are physically
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
smaller than most women so I don't think
 
04:03:43.279 --> 04:03:44.429 align:start position:0%
smaller than most women so I don't think
that's

04:03:44.429 --> 04:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:03:47.349 --> 04:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh so I think the the sports part of it
 
04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should be legislating
 
04:03:51.030 --> 04:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
we should let them regulate regulate
 
04:03:54.349 --> 04:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
themselves and um and also know I think
 
04:03:56.309 --> 04:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
you alluded to situation with Vermont
 
04:03:57.750 --> 04:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
high school basketball the basketball
 
04:03:59.349 --> 04:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
team in question the player everybody
 
04:04:02.590 --> 04:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
was so upset about was actually not a
 
04:04:04.990 --> 04:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
not a very good player in fact when I I
 
04:04:06.630 --> 04:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
tracked down the videos on YouTube and I
 
04:04:08.229 --> 04:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't even sure which one it was was
 
04:04:10.110 --> 04:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
surprised couldn't tell which one they
 
04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
were complaining about in term the one
 
04:04:13.110 --> 04:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
they complaining about was well once
 
04:04:14.830 --> 04:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
again that's probably the best player
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
the coach had that's why they took her
 
04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
off that's why they sent her on the
 
04:04:20.910 --> 04:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
court but she was not a dominant player
 
04:04:24.149 --> 04:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
at all she wasn't really um you know
 
04:04:25.590 --> 04:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
she's good enough to be on the team and
 
04:04:26.910 --> 04:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
good enough to play but she was not
 
04:04:29.110 --> 04:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
blowing away the competition so I think
 
04:04:31.229 --> 04:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
uh I think we should leave well enough
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
alone and probably also leave on with
 
04:04:35.670 --> 04:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
like the locker rooms and the bathrooms
 
04:04:39.189 --> 04:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
let the organizations you know let the
 
04:04:41.469 --> 04:04:41.479 align:start position:0%
uh owners of the buildings uh work work
 
04:04:43.550 --> 04:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
that out I don't think there's like a
 
04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
large I don't think there's a very large
 
04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
problem about a lot of is are the fear
 
04:04:49.710 --> 04:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
of what might happen more than anything
 
04:04:51.750 --> 04:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
that has happened and certainly and
 
04:04:54.030 --> 04:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
certainly it's illegal even for a man to
 
04:04:55.630 --> 04:04:55.640 align:start position:0%
go into the men's room and assault
 
04:04:58.429 --> 04:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
another man and it would be legal for
 
04:05:00.870 --> 04:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
woman even assist you know woman with
 
04:05:02.750 --> 04:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
excess chromosomes who's you know
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
clearly looks female everyone it's
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
illegal for her to like assault another
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
female and the in in the locker room or
 
04:05:11.469 --> 04:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
even for her to go into the men's locker
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
room and assault a person I think we
 
04:05:15.110 --> 04:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
have like sufficient laws on the books
 
04:05:17.910 --> 04:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
that deal with that sort of case so so I
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
think this bill is a I think the
 
04:05:22.149 --> 04:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
amendment like the underlying bill is is
 
04:05:22.159 --> 04:05:24.229 align:start position:0%
amendment like the underlying bill is is
unnecessary

04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
so uh represent gson did you have oh
 
04:05:27.840 --> 04:05:30.229 align:start position:0%
so uh represent gson did you have oh
representative

04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:05:32.510 --> 04:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
Perez parents didn't call me because
 
04:05:34.269 --> 04:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
they were offended parents called me
 
04:05:35.870 --> 04:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
because they were
 
04:05:38.429 --> 04:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
concerned concerned about the safety of
 
04:05:40.590 --> 04:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
their children concerned about a sixth
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
grade girl having a UTI a seventh grade
 
04:05:47.309 --> 04:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
boy urinating in on the bus because he
 
04:05:51.469 --> 04:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
couldn't hold it any longer um there
 
04:05:51.479 --> 04:05:52.269 align:start position:0%
couldn't hold it any longer um there
it's

04:05:52.269 --> 04:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:05:56.510 --> 04:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
concern um not offended by it at all um
 
04:05:59.389 --> 04:05:59.399 align:start position:0%
I don't understand I you know when when
 
04:06:03.510 --> 04:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
talking to people about this and many
 
04:06:06.590 --> 04:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
some that disagreed with me about it and
 
04:06:08.790 --> 04:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that said to them and
 
04:06:11.149 --> 04:06:11.159 align:start position:0%
I'd like each of us to consider this if
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
you have children or young adult
 
04:06:15.790 --> 04:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
children or
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
grandchildren consider the fact that
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
your child has been the number one track
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
star for the girls cross country and is
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to college on a scholarship based
 
04:06:34.030 --> 04:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
on that but their senior year of high
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
school they lose every single event
 
04:06:43.309 --> 04:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
because a um a male identifying as a
 
04:06:46.830 --> 04:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
female is now allowed on the team but
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't bother me as much as the
 
04:06:52.750 --> 04:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
fact that for safety it is an issue it
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't bother me as much for the
 
04:07:00.189 --> 04:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
bathroom bothers me
 
04:07:03.469 --> 04:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
because they're afraid to go into it and
 
04:07:06.349 --> 04:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's there's another place they could go
 
04:07:09.030 --> 04:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
and you know young children or high
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
school kids don't understand why all of
 
04:07:13.680 --> 04:07:15.429 align:start position:0%
school kids don't understand why all of
a

04:07:15.429 --> 04:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
sudden they have to compete when they
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
haven't have to compete with someone who
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
is born a different sex than they are
 
04:07:26.590 --> 04:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
identifying at this has nothing to do
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
with how you identify it's not
 
04:07:31.070 --> 04:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
discriminating against you because how
 
04:07:31.080 --> 04:07:31.950 align:start position:0%
discriminating against you because how
you

04:07:31.950 --> 04:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
identify it's not discriminating against
 
04:07:38.149 --> 04:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
you at all it's protecting the safe and
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
the Dignity of the of the majority and
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
the Privacy the privacy of the majority
 
04:07:49.990 --> 04:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
I do not I'm an adult if I go into a
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
bathroom and a and
 
04:07:55.429 --> 04:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
a someone with a gender IDE I can cope
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
with that that's all right I'm an adult
 
04:08:00.870 --> 04:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
I can choose but we're not allowing
 
04:08:06.149 --> 04:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
younger people that courtesy of being
 
04:08:08.429 --> 04:08:08.439 align:start position:0%
safe comfortable
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
respected in private areas and we're not
 
04:08:15.149 --> 04:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
allowing young people to succeed in
 
04:08:18.149 --> 04:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
sports that they were succeeding in and
 
04:08:21.510 --> 04:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
to lose where are the women standing up
 
04:08:23.670 --> 04:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
for women's
 
04:08:26.670 --> 04:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
rights thank you other comment did
 
04:08:30.389 --> 04:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
somebody else uh yes representative
 
04:08:33.469 --> 04:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
testerman I do think agree with
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
representative Perez to some extent and
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
I do think though that there is an issue
 
04:08:43.750 --> 04:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
of identity when you identify as a black
 
04:08:46.990 --> 04:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
person and you're
 
04:08:49.070 --> 04:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
not you're going to have a little
 
04:08:52.229 --> 04:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting whatever access you
 
04:08:56.109 --> 04:08:56.119 align:start position:0%
want you identify as a female and you're
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
not and all of a sudden we get everybody
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
trying to defend you and I think that's
 
04:09:01.439 --> 04:09:02.469 align:start position:0%
trying to defend you and I think that's
just

04:09:02.469 --> 04:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
wrong I just don't think we have a right
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
to to make our personal Identity or as
 
04:09:16.149 --> 04:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
as a function of what access we get I I
 
04:09:18.389 --> 04:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
just can't accept
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
this I'm sorry representative L did I do
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
you have
 
04:09:26.710 --> 04:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
sure so I feel first of all thank you
 
04:09:30.670 --> 04:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
for taking U my comment um I just want
 
04:09:33.389 --> 04:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
to say that times have changed and I
 
04:09:37.030 --> 04:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
think these days we need to be open to
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
understanding what's going on in our
 
04:09:43.590 --> 04:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
society um it's not it's not like um
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
what like you say that you go go along
 
04:09:50.750 --> 04:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
and everybody is either um you know just
 
04:09:54.189 --> 04:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
monogamous and they're just with with
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
within their own sex or not the problem
 
04:10:00.670 --> 04:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
is is that we need to be willing to be
 
04:10:03.469 --> 04:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
understanding um what's going on out
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
there and
 
04:10:08.990 --> 04:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
um um I can even say in my own town
 
04:10:11.870 --> 04:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
we've had some issues of of things and
 
04:10:13.950 --> 04:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to say that the biggest
 
04:10:17.429 --> 04:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
Pro the biggest thing is I find that a
 
04:10:19.349 --> 04:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
lot of people out there are not willing
 
04:10:22.389 --> 04:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
to open their minds to a lot of things
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
that have changed in our society and
 
04:10:27.309 --> 04:10:27.319 align:start position:0%
people have to get more uh better
 
04:10:30.189 --> 04:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
educated to know what exactly is going
 
04:10:33.670 --> 04:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
on I deal as a nurse I deal with people
 
04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
all the time I'm a labor nurse so I see
 
04:10:37.990 --> 04:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
it number one
 
04:10:41.429 --> 04:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
um people don't have to um on the uh
 
04:10:44.510 --> 04:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
birth certificate now to say if a if
 
04:10:47.309 --> 04:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
it's a boy or a girl that is not what's
 
04:10:50.309 --> 04:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
happening it's they can choose not to
 
04:10:53.309 --> 04:10:53.319 align:start position:0%
and have the child um uh decide on their
 
04:10:56.670 --> 04:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
own what they want to be and but the
 
04:10:59.349 --> 04:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
thing is people have to be educated and
 
04:11:04.990 --> 04:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
I think um yes you know like I said um
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot
 
04:11:11.149 --> 04:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
of should say controversy in regards to
 
04:11:13.870 --> 04:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
you know the sports teams there's you
 
04:11:17.910 --> 04:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
know um but at the same
 
04:11:20.670 --> 04:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
time you know a lot of people say Well
 
04:11:23.070 --> 04:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
when a child is better educated about
 
04:11:27.109 --> 04:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
this um or more educated about um
 
04:11:30.030 --> 04:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
becoming transvesti or whatever uh
 
04:11:32.429 --> 04:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
transsexual the problem
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
is no children are a lot more
 
04:11:38.269 --> 04:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's going on there
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
than I think adults are and I think the
 
04:11:48.030 --> 04:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
big thing is is we have to um Listen and
 
04:11:51.109 --> 04:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
talk to people and be um and understand
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
and talk to our own children sit down
 
04:11:56.030 --> 04:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
how did your day go what happened and
 
04:12:00.429 --> 04:12:00.439 align:start position:0%
not so much just kind of um brushing off
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
of of and just sitting down with them
 
04:12:07.670 --> 04:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
more um no is it a uh is it going to be
 
04:12:11.309 --> 04:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable um uh conversations yes
 
04:12:14.149 --> 04:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
but I think it's you know we really need
 
04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
to I think think about when we go to
 
04:12:20.670 --> 04:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
make a decision here that that it's not
 
04:12:22.670 --> 04:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
was going I say a black and white
 
04:12:26.189 --> 04:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
decision we really have to think about
 
04:12:30.870 --> 04:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
exactly um the you know exactly talking
 
04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
about the biological sex and no and
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
nobody can choose that nobody truly can
 
04:12:41.229 --> 04:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
choose the life that your child will
 
04:12:44.590 --> 04:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
leave live I mean pardon me will live or
 
04:12:47.309 --> 04:12:47.319 align:start position:0%
or anybody's child would live you know
 
04:12:48.750 --> 04:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
that's the thing is we're all
 
04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
individuals and we have to realize that
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
and um I appreciate you just taking my
 
04:12:56.910 --> 04:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
comment representative Stapleton did you
 
04:13:01.149 --> 04:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
have something you want to say Yes
 
04:13:03.429 --> 04:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
um personal
 
04:13:09.109 --> 04:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
identity should be and is a personal ch
 
04:13:11.469 --> 04:13:11.479 align:start position:0%
choice but the there has to be a
 
04:13:15.070 --> 04:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
differenti entiation between personal
 
04:13:18.349 --> 04:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
choice and statutory
 
04:13:21.870 --> 04:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
purpose if we're going to have order
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
safety um respect um we we need to
 
04:13:28.670 --> 04:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the personal
 
04:13:28.680 --> 04:13:30.030 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the personal
aspect

04:13:30.030 --> 04:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
04:13:35.229 --> 04:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
subjective and the statutory aspect
 
04:13:37.550 --> 04:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
objective and I think we're Crossing
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
these things over and that's going to
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
give rise to
 
04:13:43.790 --> 04:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
difficulty I'd like to follow up with
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
the idea of or title N9 I'm not sure
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
when that was formulated or written into
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
law but I would suspect that it was
 
04:13:55.269 --> 04:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
during a
 
04:14:00.510 --> 04:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
period when um in the context of
 
04:14:04.269 --> 04:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
cultural understanding at the time so if
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
we have an absent uh absence of
 
04:14:10.510 --> 04:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
separation within Title 9
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
law I believe it was probably because
 
04:14:16.030 --> 04:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
the understanding cultural understanding
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
at the time was that separate in many
 
04:14:24.910 --> 04:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
cases was orderly and required
 
04:14:27.149 --> 04:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:14:27.159 --> 04:14:29.070 align:start position:0%
and and
reasonable

04:14:29.070 --> 04:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
so I I've got to go
 
04:14:35.830 --> 04:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
with um supporting the amendment and the
 
04:14:38.670 --> 04:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
bill um because of those differences
 
04:14:47.189 --> 04:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:49.590 --> 04:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
use thank you if I could just follow up
 
04:14:52.910 --> 04:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
for a minute representative Testament I
 
04:14:55.469 --> 04:14:55.479 align:start position:0%
I frequently find your comments very
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and your your division
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
between subjective and objective makes a
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
lot of sense to me and I think it's
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
something we ought to be reminded when
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
we try to make a whole series of
 
04:15:14.070 --> 04:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
decisions the reason Title 9 was created
 
04:15:19.309 --> 04:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
was not to um put in place
 
04:15:23.870 --> 04:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
separate it was to say that public funds
 
04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
other funds were all going for athletics
 
04:15:32.229 --> 04:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
for men and women should also have
 
04:15:36.750 --> 04:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities for example in um well in
 
04:15:40.109 --> 04:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
every University in the country um you
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
know there's the football team the
 
04:15:44.429 --> 04:15:44.439 align:start position:0%
basketball team the hockey team whatever
 
04:15:46.349 --> 04:15:46.359 align:start position:0%
and with a lot of money a lot of
 
04:15:49.590 --> 04:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
resources uniforms support the question
 
04:15:52.269 --> 04:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
was should there not be comparable
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities for fine women athletes to
 
04:15:58.910 --> 04:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
be able to participate and so that was
 
04:16:01.469 --> 04:16:01.479 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind it wasn't to to
 
04:16:03.510 --> 04:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
make it separate but equal it was to
 
04:16:07.590 --> 04:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
create an opportunity but I do want to
 
04:16:10.550 --> 04:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
reiterate that I think you're very
 
04:16:12.349 --> 04:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
thought-provoking when you talk about
 
04:16:14.590 --> 04:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
objective and subjective I come down in
 
04:16:17.389 --> 04:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
a different place than you do but in no
 
04:16:20.590 --> 04:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
way does that challenge
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
your your perspective which I
 
04:16:27.149 --> 04:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
respect thank you for that uh further
 
04:16:31.590 --> 04:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:33.710 --> 04:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
it yeah I just want to go back to I
 
04:16:35.550 --> 04:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
guess where originally started on this
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
this whole bill um it's a bill that
 
04:16:40.389 --> 04:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
speaks about biological sex it's a bill
 
04:16:42.469 --> 04:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
that does not speak at all about how
 
04:16:46.229 --> 04:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
biological sex is defined um we heard
 
04:16:48.910 --> 04:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
during the testimony multiple ways in
 
04:16:51.389 --> 04:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
which biological sex could be defined
 
04:16:54.309 --> 04:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
either external sexual traits it could
 
04:16:56.429 --> 04:16:56.439 align:start position:0%
be chromosomes it could be hormonal and
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
I think there's others and every one of
 
04:17:02.670 --> 04:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
those has an in an exception an unclear
 
04:17:06.189 --> 04:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
or ambiguous State um I think it's very
 
04:17:09.109 --> 04:17:09.119 align:start position:0%
dangerous to say that the government and
 
04:17:11.149 --> 04:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
I know it's not mandated that it that it
 
04:17:15.149 --> 04:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
must but it can apply a completely
 
04:17:15.159 --> 04:17:16.670 align:start position:0%
must but it can apply a completely
undefined

04:17:16.670 --> 04:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
undefined
 
04:17:20.189 --> 04:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
characteristic um uh that most people
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
might feel they know what that what it
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
is but I don't think we ever got to a
 
04:17:25.070 --> 04:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
conclusion nobody that I asked in
 
04:17:27.269 --> 04:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
testimony ever came to a conclusion so I
 
04:17:29.229 --> 04:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
think from that perspective alone and I
 
04:17:30.750 --> 04:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
won't go into some of the other aspects
 
04:17:32.550 --> 04:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill but you know I think that
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:38.429 --> 04:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
unworkable the only comment that I would
 
04:17:40.870 --> 04:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
make uh and I think we probably oh I'm
 
04:17:42.070 --> 04:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
sorry does somebody else have a comment
 
04:17:46.670 --> 04:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
04:17:52.750 --> 04:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
comment I have been listening very
 
04:17:55.149 --> 04:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
closely to everybody I think we could
 
04:17:59.349 --> 04:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
sit here all 20 of us and talk about it
 
04:18:03.109 --> 04:18:03.119 align:start position:0%
all day I believe that those that are
 
04:18:05.550 --> 04:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
for this bill are not going to change
 
04:18:07.710 --> 04:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
their mind I believe those that are
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
against the bill are not going to change
 
04:18:13.469 --> 04:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
their mind and I think it's time to vote
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
what I would like to see is something go
 
04:18:21.309 --> 04:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
to the house floor for 400 people to
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
debate and vote that's that's just my
 
04:18:28.590 --> 04:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
opinion now when we talk about equid
 
04:18:31.590 --> 04:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
equility and
 
04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
fairness being a biological female I
 
04:18:39.469 --> 04:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
will say this and not I'm I'm not biased
 
04:18:42.109 --> 04:18:42.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not against transgender or anybody
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
or anything but when we talk to
 
04:18:49.790 --> 04:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
fist when it comes to females why is it
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
fair for a biological
 
04:18:56.630 --> 04:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
male to be in a
 
04:19:00.950 --> 04:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
sport with a biological females or other
 
04:19:04.149 --> 04:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
females and there's no chance that those
 
04:19:07.109 --> 04:19:07.119 align:start position:0%
females are going to beat that person in
 
04:19:07.119 --> 04:19:07.990 align:start position:0%
females are going to beat that person in
that

04:19:07.990 --> 04:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:10.950 --> 04:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
sport I have been competitive all my
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
life I may not look at but I have I love
 
04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
running in everything else if I ever
 
04:19:21.950 --> 04:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
thought when I was younger I was
 
04:19:24.309 --> 04:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
going to be in
 
04:19:28.750 --> 04:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
track and work extensively year in and
 
04:19:32.429 --> 04:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
year out in a biological male came along
 
04:19:34.389 --> 04:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
and got in the sport and took it away
 
04:19:38.309 --> 04:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
from me I think it's sad and I know and
 
04:19:42.349 --> 04:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
I know what I'm talking about I grew
 
04:19:46.710 --> 04:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
up with my father and four brothers I
 
04:19:50.590 --> 04:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
know what strength is and even though I
 
04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
grew up as a tom boy and was thought I
 
04:19:57.710 --> 04:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
was very strong there is no way I was
 
04:20:00.670 --> 04:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
ever stronger than the males in my
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
family or anybody else my husband and
 
04:20:07.469 --> 04:20:07.479 align:start position:0%
nobody and it's just fness and somehow
 
04:20:09.870 --> 04:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
we got to come to some conclusion and I
 
04:20:11.950 --> 04:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
know people will say well what about the
 
04:20:14.790 --> 04:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
transgender what are they supposed to do
 
04:20:16.590 --> 04:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
there are other sports and I've been
 
04:20:19.870 --> 04:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
looking in or other avenues of sports
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
and I've been looking into it but
 
04:20:22.000 --> 04:20:23.670 align:start position:0%
and I've been looking into it but
different

04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:20:26.590 --> 04:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
categories that people can get into and
 
04:20:26.600 --> 04:20:28.149 align:start position:0%
categories that people can get into and
it's

04:20:28.149 --> 04:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:20:31.830 --> 04:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
fair and they're in a good spot okay
 
04:20:35.469 --> 04:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
let's take someone somebody that's in
 
04:20:38.670 --> 04:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.229 --> 04:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
and can't be in a regular sport they
 
04:20:43.590 --> 04:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
have special
 
04:20:46.950 --> 04:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
sports for special education people and
 
04:20:48.870 --> 04:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's different kinds of sports for
 
04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know I haven't looked into it that
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
much but I've just found something and I
 
04:20:55.510 --> 04:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
want to read it extensively what I'm
 
04:20:58.830 --> 04:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
trying to say is I'm not against anybody
 
04:20:58.840 --> 04:20:59.790 align:start position:0%
trying to say is I'm not against anybody
but

04:20:59.790 --> 04:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:21:04.229 --> 04:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
somehow this female thing of unfairness
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
in sports has got to be settled
 
04:21:11.229 --> 04:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise if I being a biological
 
04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
female and I was in school if I was all
 
04:21:16.950 --> 04:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
the girls I would quit my Sport and i'
 
04:21:19.229 --> 04:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
tell the school I'm not playing anymore
 
04:21:19.239 --> 04:21:22.990 align:start position:0%
tell the school I'm not playing anymore
thank

04:21:22.990 --> 04:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
you just one comment when we when we're
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
looking at Sports and females playing
 
04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
sports with males or vice versa and this
 
04:21:35.070 --> 04:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
does happen in mixed martial arts they
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
they they train together together and
 
04:21:40.710 --> 04:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
there's not a problem with it there's
 
04:21:42.830 --> 04:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
not a problem you will train with men
 
04:21:46.109 --> 04:21:46.119 align:start position:0%
that are larger than you and and you're
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
you're in position say in Brazilian
 
04:21:51.630 --> 04:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
jiu-jitsu or wrestling and there's no
 
04:21:54.590 --> 04:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
problem with this and why there's a
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
problem now I I just don't even
 
04:21:59.910 --> 04:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
understand why people are bringing this
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
up and women too can compete at the same
 
04:22:06.469 --> 04:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
level and by putting a bill like this
 
04:22:10.149 --> 04:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
into effect as as kids progress you got
 
04:22:12.109 --> 04:22:12.119 align:start position:0%
all different ages of kids playing
 
04:22:14.030 --> 04:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
together in sports then it becomes a
 
04:22:16.990 --> 04:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
problem from what I gather is when kids
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
become more sexually
 
04:22:22.990 --> 04:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
active in in in schools and there their
 
04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
lines of problem and if you're competing
 
04:22:25.279 --> 04:22:26.510 align:start position:0%
lines of problem and if you're competing
for

04:22:26.510 --> 04:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:22:29.030 --> 04:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
scholarships of any
 
04:22:33.309 --> 04:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
kind getting into sports I don't see
 
04:22:37.469 --> 04:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
how I get frustrated with this I can't
 
04:22:41.269 --> 04:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
I just know people can play together men
 
04:22:43.750 --> 04:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
and women in sports equally they have
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
sports now racing marathons you're
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
basing it all just on strength and a
 
04:22:50.790 --> 04:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
woman's vulnerability and being a victim
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're perpetuating the
 
04:22:58.269 --> 04:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
victim and females and for me to base a
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
a a bill on that criteria alone doesn't
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
make sense at
 
04:23:05.279 --> 04:23:09.349 align:start position:0%
make sense at
all

04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:11.229 --> 04:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
I just want to remind everybody this is
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
not a shall bill this is a May uh May
 
04:23:18.510 --> 04:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
bill which is entirely different they're
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
not being mandated to do this they're
 
04:23:23.950 --> 04:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity and just I
 
04:23:25.309 --> 04:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
understand that there are a lot of
 
04:23:27.510 --> 04:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
sports that men and women can
 
04:23:31.030 --> 04:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
C paddle ball lots of things that they
 
04:23:34.510 --> 04:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
can do pool that type of thing but there
 
04:23:38.429 --> 04:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
are sports that separate two men and
 
04:23:41.710 --> 04:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
female at a certain age for example for
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
example my granddaughter played boys
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
with boys hockey up until she was 13 at
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
13 they separate them because they're
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to check and because of strength
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with speed it has
 
04:24:01.510 --> 04:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
to do with the males are stronger she
 
04:24:05.710 --> 04:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
compete she was in a she had a male 100
 
04:24:08.389 --> 04:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
PB heavy than her same age she broke her
 
04:24:12.189 --> 04:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
clavicle they are separated at ages for
 
04:24:14.830 --> 04:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
safety this is a safety thing there's no
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
safety if you're both playing pool or
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
you're doing that type of thing it is a
 
04:24:23.070 --> 04:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
safety issue and to discriminate against
 
04:24:27.149 --> 04:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
women who are succeeding in a sport by
 
04:24:29.710 --> 04:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
having a man come in and take that away
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:35.159 --> 04:24:43.429 align:start position:0%
 
women

04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:45.790 --> 04:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
