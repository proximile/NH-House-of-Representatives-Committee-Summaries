eversource arborist but before we start
 
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh that activity
 
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just go over a couple of
 
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
things that everybody here should be
 
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
aware of we have a house session
 
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
on thursday march 10th
 
00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 align:start position:0%
and the leadership team has the
 
00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 align:start position:0%
speaker's office has requested that you
 
00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:19.990 align:start position:0%
speaker's office has requested that you
reserve

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
reserve
 
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.110 align:start position:0%
reserve

the 17th
 
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
for house sessions
 
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
apparently they're not 100 sure that
 
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be here all three days
 
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
but they would like you to reserve those
 
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
three days just in case
 
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
none of our bills
 
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 align:start position:0%
are being brought up this coming
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
thursday so all 20 of the bills that
 
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
we've exact or will have exec by the end
 
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
of today
 
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
heard on either tuesday wednesday or
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
thursday of next week i don't know how
 
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
they plan to spread things out
 
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
i do know in the past
 
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
that when we've had a lot of bills
 
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of the march session they
 
00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
have tried to
 
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
reverse things
 
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
on one or more days so that st e
 
00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 align:start position:0%
wouldn't always be last sometimes we'd
 
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
be first
 
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
or close to the beginning of the session
 
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that will happen
 
00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 align:start position:0%
but there's no guarantee
 
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted you to be aware of of
 
00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 align:start position:0%
what the schedule looks like
 
00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative thomas thank you mr chair
 
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
i did happen to approach that question
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
with the speaker's office last week and
 
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
at this point they have they have no
 
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
plans to do any reversal of
 
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
of the calendar
 
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
they'll keep to the schedule as it
 
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
always has been i guess
 
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.630 align:start position:0%
always has been i guess
so

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
and i have one further question mr uh
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
will we will we be having any other
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
committee meetings here before the 29th
 
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the month
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's tbd
 
00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
i did talk to the clerk he said that
 
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
we could start hearing senate bills even
 
00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 align:start position:0%
before crossover
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
provided that the senate sends them to
 
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.990 align:start position:0%
provided that the senate sends them to
us

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
so if they do that it's there is the
 
00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
potential we may have a session before
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
the 29th but
 
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
as of today i don't know of one so
 
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
if we do it it'll be on a monday or a
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
tuesday follow-up uh yeah so if if i
 
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
made just a general announcement
 
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
everyone here has been contacted but we
 
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
we will be having a
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
field trip to the seabrook station
 
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room right now has
 
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
responded to me so that's good
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
and those that have said that they would
 
00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.150 align:start position:0%
and those that have said that they would
be

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
attending please watch your emails for
 
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
future emails on the details times and
 
00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
information you'll have to provide and
 
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative occident
 
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
has there been any explanation of why
 
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
none of our bills will be heard this
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
week because this means that everything
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
will be jammed and we will have the
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
maximum pressure to
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
table everything and forego proper
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
consideration of the work that's done by
 
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
well i have already expressed my concern
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
to leadership that
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
we've been tabling far too many of our
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
bills so they're aware of our concern
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
the reason that none of our bills were
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled for this coming session on
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
thursday is because we didn't get them
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
done on time and i'll take full
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that i shouldn't have
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
waited until the end to do all the exact
 
00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
sessions we should have been doing exec
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
sessions concurrently with our public
 
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.350 align:start position:0%
sessions concurrently with our public
hearings

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
that was a
 
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
sort of a rookie mistake on my part
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
so i will take full responsibility for
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
that and apologize to all of you for
 
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
doing that we won't make that mistake
 
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
again when we start receiving senate
 
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
bills we'll have public hearings and
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
one after the other
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
maybe not right after a public hearing
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
but maybe the next day
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
so that we make sure we get all these
 
00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.749 align:start position:0%
 
before

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
the end of the
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
of the time period before the deadline
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
is that going to give us time to discuss
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
the bills if we're going to do them so
 
00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:24.710 align:start position:0%
the bills if we're going to do them so
quickly

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what's coming up but i
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
know some things require discussion
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
so i want to be sure that we're going to
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
be able to do that
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
that's a good point what we're going to
 
00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:35.830 align:start position:0%
that's a good point what we're going to
do

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
is at the conclusion of every public
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
hearing we're going to discuss
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
what the next step will be do you want
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
to go directly to exec session or do you
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
want to have a work session
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
what is your pleasure and we'll decide
 
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
that as a committee and then we'll
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
move forward with whatever that decision
 
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.110 align:start position:0%
move forward with whatever that decision
is

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative notter thank you mr
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
chairman you don't have to apologize for
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
not having all the bills done early
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
because every committee is different if
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
you look at some of the other committees
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
they do the same thing and that's why
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
once a year in march we have a very busy
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
week with sometimes uh three days in a
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
row of session or
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
last term we had that overnight session
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
so if you you haven't been a
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative until you have um
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
survived a slumber party in reps hall
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's a good point
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
i take a lot of pride in in running an
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
efficient committee and so that's why i
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
apologize because i feel i let
 
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
myself and the rest of the committee
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
down by not being quite as efficient as
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
we could have been it wasn't really a
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
mistake just a
 
00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:39.510 align:start position:0%
mistake just a
a

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
less than efficient process and i'll
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
address that with my performance going
 
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.830 align:start position:0%
address that with my performance going
forward

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
just a reminiscent of last term when we
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
met all night long i was scintillating
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
at four in the morning with a floor
 
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.350 align:start position:0%
at four in the morning with a floor
speech

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
speech
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
that's true you were you are
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
scintillating scintillating fred that's
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
so it it appears now that we have a
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
substitute today for
 
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.070 align:start position:0%

representative oxenoum
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps this is a point of order or
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
point of clarification
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
i noticed that the amendment that we
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
were are about to be considering has
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
numerous uh typographical and other
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
confusing material
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
are we
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
going to do something about that and
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
have yet another
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
well we're going to discuss any
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
discrepancies that you find in the bill
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
we have discovered a couple ourselves
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
and they are the type of typos that
 
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
would be corrected by ols during the
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
bill enrollment process
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to do anything about
 
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.269 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to do anything about
those

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
unless somebody finds something that is
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
egregious and is not a typo that would
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
have to be addressed so that will happen
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
during our discussion of the amendment
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
once we get there
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.389 align:start position:0%
anything else
okay

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%

on the 28th so i now make a motion to

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i would like to know if there's any

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
when this bill was drafted
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
it started out with the manufacturer
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
being the responsible party and people
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
raised the objection what if it's
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
chinese how you go chase them so then it
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
was suggested we make it retailer and
 
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.470 align:start position:0%
was suggested we make it retailer and
then

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
we got some feedback well what if the
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
retailers in mexico so now it's the
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%

i'll second that
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
representative platt moves and
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative harrington seconds the
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
and we can now discuss
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'll recognize representative platt
 
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.110 align:start position:0%
i'll recognize representative platt
first

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier this this wording is
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
the same except for a couple of typos
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
the correct krypton will get fixed but
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'll ask people to
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
point out what they think is a typo
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
but it changes the onus it puts the onus
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
on the installer who should be
 
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.310 align:start position:0%
on the installer who should be
either

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
local or a surrounding state at worst
 
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.390 align:start position:0%
local or a surrounding state at worst
okay

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion on this
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee yes thank you mr
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
chairman um fred it puts the onness on
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
the installer but it also puts the
 
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.230 align:start position:0%
the installer but it also puts the
expense

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
expense
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
on the installer
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
i'm referring specifically to section
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
three on page two that says the
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
stewardship plan shall at a minimum
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
describe how installers will finance the
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
take back and recycling system including
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
an adequate funding mechanism to finance
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
the costs of collection management and
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
recycling of photovoltaic voltaic
 
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.390 align:start position:0%
recycling of photovoltaic voltaic
modules

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
modules
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
and residuals sold in or into the state
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
by the installer with the mechanism that
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
ensures that photovoltaic modules can be
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
delivered to take back locations without
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
cost to the last owner or holder and the
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
question that i have for you
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative flatt
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
is why wouldn't the
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't the cost of that recycling
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
be on
 
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
the the person who owns the system like
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
because to me it they're the owner and
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
it could be 20 25 years you don't know
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
if these companies
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
are going to be around and so it's very
 
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
hard to structure it the way you have it
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
structured and make it work
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
you follow where you were but i heard
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
your words so
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative platt is recognized sorry
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
yeah it's section three on page two
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
lines okay 19 through 26. the answer is
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
obviously it will be on the owner
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
because uh the installer is an
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket cost they're going to pass
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
that on to the owner or they're going to
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
get some
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
uh some contributions from the installer
 
00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:47.350 align:start position:0%
uh some contributions from the installer
or

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
the the retailer or manufacturer but
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be paid for and and that
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
cost will be passed on to the owner it
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
may be a discounted cost because you're
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
collecting money now for 25 years from
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
now and so it's a fun to grow but it
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
will be passed under the owner one way
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
or the other
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
up follow up that can get
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
very complicated the way that you just
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
described that um
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that that to me is the crux
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
of what
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
not responsible about putting this in
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
without further information on how this
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
would actually be enacted because
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
what it does is it puts the onus on the
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
installer and says you're going to have
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
to figure out a way
 
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.710 align:start position:0%
to figure out a way
to

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
finance this and put money aside for it
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
and prove that you're doing that but it
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't really talk about
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
in any specific way about the
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
implementation which because of the long
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
time differential seems like it
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to make happen i just i
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
don't understand how this bill can be
 
00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:50.070 align:start position:0%
don't understand how this bill can be
implemented

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
and to me it looks like a real
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
disincentive because it's going to add
 
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.470 align:start position:0%
disincentive because it's going to add
costs

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
to the installers
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
bottom line
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
for a service that i thought we were
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
trying to incent in the state
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
so representative mcgee if you look at
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
page two lines five six
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
yep etc
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
it just directs the department of
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
environmental services to develop
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
guidance for the model stewardship and
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
take back program so the installers
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
tasked with creating the program
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
themselves they'll get guidance from des
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
on how to create the program
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
and presumably des would come up with a
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
guide that every in style installer
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
would would follow to create those
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
programs and that seems inconsistent as
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
well because it says by january 2024 the
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
department shall have established the
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
process but it's asking the installers
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
as of july of 2022 to begin creating
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
programs that would be governed by
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
guidelines that don't exist until you
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
know a year and a half later
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
i believe if you look at lines 20
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
on line 20 on page 2 it specifies july
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
not 2022 i'm sorry where am i looking
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
here oh it's down except all of their
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's line 27 i'm looking at except all
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
of their photovoltaic model modules sold
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
in or into the state jul by after july
 
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.430 align:start position:0%
in or into the state jul by after july
2022

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
2022
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
so that's the date i was looking at
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
and that's the section on stewardship
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
plan right representative platt
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i don't know who the
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
who who who
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
is trying to incent solar
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'm neutral uh frankly i'm not trying to
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
incent anything nor am i trying to
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
disincent i'm trying to reflect the true
 
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.390 align:start position:0%
disincent i'm trying to reflect the true
cost

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
and and recover it so it doesn't wind up
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
worse than landfills in the in the woods
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
like tires do
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it there
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion representative
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
mann has a comment
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i think this
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
don't usually like to think of myself as
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
negative but i really don't like this
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
bill at all i think it adds cost to the
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
and disincense of solar installations
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
which we really need to do
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
for climate reasons
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
which are far exceed anything about
 
00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:20.390 align:start position:0%
which are far exceed anything about
dumps

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
dumps
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
in landfills um
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
and i i would
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
think that the bill would at least first
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
investigate the whole issue of recycling
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
and require in other words require
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
or set up
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
a process or procedure or responsibility
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
for investigating the whole issue of
 
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
of recycling and this bill just assumes
 
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.710 align:start position:0%
of recycling and this bill just assumes
that

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
we don't know but we know who's going to
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:53.350 align:start position:0%
pay for it
and

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
i think it's just
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
has a very bad effect on
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
what we really need to be getting done
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you before i take another comment
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
i want to point out that on page 3
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
line 22
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
and line 32
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
repeat the word installer
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
so it says a distributor installer or
 
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.950 align:start position:0%
so it says a distributor installer or
installer

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
installer
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's the typo that ols will fix
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
when if the ball
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
if the bill gets to the enrollment
 
00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.990 align:start position:0%
if the bill gets to the enrollment
process

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
so please let me know if there are any
 
00:24:27.919 --> 00:24:28.870 align:start position:0%
so please let me know if there are any
others

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.830 align:start position:0%
others
representative

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
oxenom thank you mr chair there are
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
about seven different ones where it says
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
a installer and it should say an
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
installer there are three
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
installer or installer references and i
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
can hand you a an edited version
 
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.230 align:start position:0%
can hand you a an edited version
um

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
that wasn't the reason i had my hands up
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
however am i am i called on for a
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
content um
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes let me just point out that for
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
example on line 30 on page three it says
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
a installer we probably should say an
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
installer that's the kind of typo that
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
ols would fix yes so we don't have to
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
worry about that but now you're
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
recognized to make other comments about
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.029 align:start position:0%
the uh
amendment

00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
that this particular bill does go
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
against stated state policy in our
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
10-year strategic plan and also in our
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
statutes in which we do incentivize
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
renewable energy because the state does
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that renewable energy is in
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
fact of value to the state its citizens
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
and its businesses i don't know why we
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
want to disincentivize a local business
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
which provides local jobs local
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
opportunities i don't know why we would
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
want to engage in mandating
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
a a policy which has a punitive fine
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
attached to it this appears to be a
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
problem insert
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
a solution excuse me in search of a
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
problem where we're drowning in plastic
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
bags we have ocean animals that are
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
stranded on beaches that is a problem
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
that needs addressing
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
tires were a problem as representative
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out and that has been addressed
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
no other single industry in new
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire has been singled out in the
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
fashion of this bill and i think that's
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
a very bad idea it puts a burden on our
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
local businesses and as much as i am in
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
favor of
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
that is the way to go redesign the
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
product so it minimizes the waste
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
but we don't do that in this way and as
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
a final point not only are our
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
installers having to pay for the
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
things that are mentioned on page two
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
but on page four
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
i believe it's page four yes page four
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
they're also funding the department of
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
energy uh you know with this um
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
taking care of these costs so i i on all
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at roman numeral eight
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
and you get about several sentences down
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
maybe it's
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
further down there's hereby actually
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
lines one and two on page four say the
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
department may collect a flat fee from
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
participating installers to recover
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
costs associated with the plan guidance
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
review et cetera and it goes on there's
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
there are many things in here that are
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
cost for the department that uh the
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
installers are now going to have to pay
 
00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh and they're sufficiently vague that i
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
can see other costs also being
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative platt i just point out
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's not the department of energy it's
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
whichever it's a state department and
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's administrative costs that would not
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
be burdensome for any other industry but
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
oxendium would you see this as being any
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
different than the costs imposed on
 
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.470 align:start position:0%
different than the costs imposed on
utilities

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
when they
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
visit the site evaluation committee to
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
submit a project to the committee for
 
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.230 align:start position:0%
submit a project to the committee for
consideration

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
we will have an opportunity to talk
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
about the site evaluation committee and
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
there are the short answer is no and you
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
probably don't want the long answer
 
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.909 align:start position:0%
probably don't want the long answer
today

00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i would argue that it is
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
very similar representative thomas
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill that has great foresight
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
we know that there will be a problem we
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
know there is a problem because we know
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
that because
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
we have some some issues now but we know
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the long run
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a bigger problem
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
why not
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
try to come up with a solution
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
that helps a problem that we know about
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
instead of you know the old proverbial
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road
 
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.029 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road
it

00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
surprised me that if it's a
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
project that someone is not interested
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
in then they're okay with things but if
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's a project that they are interested
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
in it's not okay with things i think we
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
should attack
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
any problem we see having to do with the
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
recycling and landfills whether or not
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's our favorite project or not
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
so i believe this bill
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
was fashioned after a state a
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
very very environmentally conscious
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
state i if i do say so and i would like
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
to hear from from the sponsor
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
how a bill of this type has been
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
accepted and how it's been working in in
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
the state that this bill was fashioned
 
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.070 align:start position:0%
the state that this bill was fashioned
after

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
my understanding it's the state of
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
washington and my understanding it was
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
working quite well as originally drafted
 
00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.990 align:start position:0%
working quite well as originally drafted
manufacturer

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
so the changes we made would make it
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
even better uh and
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
washington state is not alone i mean
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
california has rules not not law but
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
rules to do the same thing and there's
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
several other states who are in
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
investigating this to eventually do the
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
same thing including as i recall from my
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
testimony rhode island
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
and a few others
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
any follow-up representative thomas
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
um well
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
just that uh if if a problem exists a
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
problem exists whether it's a
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
whether it involves an industry that
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
we're in favor of or an industry that
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
we're not in favor of i think if the
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
problem exists we should have the
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
foresight to try and do something about
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
it up front even it may take time to
 
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
perfect it but i think now is the time
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
to have the conversation so i'm i'm in
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
favor of the spill in one form or
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
another to get the conversation going i
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
think it's an issue that we need to
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
address and we right now we have time to
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
perfect it uh we don't have time when
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
someone says we should have done this
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
ten years ago so i'd be in favor of this
 
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.509 align:start position:0%
ten years ago so i'd be in favor of this
bill

00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative plett you said
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
that washington state has rules to
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
implement this program
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't the bill on page 4 line 23
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
call for the department to adopt rules
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
for the administration of the
 
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.789 align:start position:0%
for the administration of the
subdivision

00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
well i didn't say that washington state
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
has rules i said washington state has a
 
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:23.990 align:start position:0%
has rules i said washington state has a
law

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
that this was modeled after but in that
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
large it refers to the their equivalent
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
department developing rules as as does
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
this one i said california has rules
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
my mistake thank you
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
yes i would love to be correct uh
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
correction to fight this oh thank you
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
chair i'd love to be corrected if i'm
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
mistaken but i believe washington state
 
00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:49.430 align:start position:0%
mistaken but i believe washington state
their

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
implementation of solar recycling is
 
00:31:51.679 --> 00:31:52.549 align:start position:0%
implementation of solar recycling is
done

00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
as part of a comprehensive plan
 
00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:56.710 align:start position:0%
as part of a comprehensive plan
of

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
of producer
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
responsibility which uh
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
incorporates a number of different uh
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh recycling areas including the solar
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
panels um
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
and it does not single out solar panels
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
per se
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
i know there is a bill out there that
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
does single it out but i think they're
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
attacking the problem in a in a
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way which i would prefer
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
because i don't see a lot of solar
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
panels in our woods but i do see
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of tires in our woods
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative platt yes i address this
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
in my testimony um a lot of the small
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
stuff tires is
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
there's a program
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
at dpw
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
dtw's transfer stations to pick this
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
stuff up at reasonable cost i just
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to dispose of the computer i
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
was using here for five bucks
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
and so it's not big out of pocket cost
 
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.789 align:start position:0%
and so it's not big out of pocket cost
tires

00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
tires
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
aren't that expensive but there were
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
still some scarf laws that dump them in
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
the woods i also said that the reason
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
the solar panels are being picked out is
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
because a lot of other technologies go
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
to the site evaluation committee and the
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee requires
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
end of life disposal of some sort
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
certainly a nuclear plant but win wind
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
turbines have to have a disposal plan as
 
00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:11.350 align:start position:0%
turbines have to have a disposal plan as
well

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.149 align:start position:0%
well
but

00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
these solar panels are smaller bigger
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
than the local electronics but smaller
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
than that scale so that's why this is if
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
you call it singled out it's it's
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be fixed and
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
frankly when we start getting making
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
progress with this i might come back
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
someday and say for
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
power batteries that might be need a
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
program as well but that's that's
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
something for a future day
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
i want to thank
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative plett for bringing this
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.549 align:start position:0%
to us
however

00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
i think when this came in
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
well when this came to us
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
not the urgency i think that we feel now
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
this bill was conceived before this
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
current situation
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
we are in a situation now where
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
all kinds of fuel
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
are going to be in short supply
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
electricity being one
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
we don't want to put any more of a
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
burden on the people who are installing
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
or the people who are buying
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
these panels
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
the average life of a panel is about 30
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
years and it starts to deteriorate
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 20. we only really
 
00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.430 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 20. we only really
began

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
began
 
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.470 align:start position:0%
began
doing

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
serious work
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
in the 2000s
 
00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is worthwhile
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
i think we have to plan for facilities
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
to recycle this because transporting
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
this material to a recycling center
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
is one in chicago takes care of the
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
midwest in illinois and say chicago and
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
illinois a big one and it does all kinds
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
of electronics including panels there's
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
a lot to be gained from doing this but i
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
think the timing
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
like everything else
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
is not right right now
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
and i think this is worthy subject
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
i think maybe in the next six months
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
we should be looking at it we should all
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
be thinking about it and thinking about
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
where we can put
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
these recycling plants and thinking
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
about the actual cost
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
of what it's really going to be
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
to recycle materials
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's not easy to send a ship over to
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
africa anymore or to india
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
we have to do it right here and we have
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
to plan to do that and i think that's
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to do and this bill
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
right now would put an additional burden
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
nuclear had a plan because
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
nobody knew what to do with nuclear fuel
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
and and it it there's quite a bit of
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
money in there for decommissioning
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
but now we know we have another 30 years
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
so i i just
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
i just think that the bill is worthy
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
but not now
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
this is not the time to put a hammer on
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
an industry that we hope will grow and
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
grow even more and if it does then we
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
have 30 years to take care of the
 
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.630 align:start position:0%
have 30 years to take care of the
problem

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree this is a problem that we
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
need to solve
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
but we do not need to solve it now
 
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.990 align:start position:0%
but we do not need to solve it now
uh

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
we we have
 
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.190 align:start position:0%
we we have
this

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
subject deserves to be in a study
 
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.470 align:start position:0%
subject deserves to be in a study
committee

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
so that we can look at it more deeply
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
come out
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
solutions i personally think the
 
00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.990 align:start position:0%
solutions i personally think the
solution

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
at the federal level not at the state
 
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.470 align:start position:0%
at the federal level not at the state
level

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
and uh i i would recommend getting a
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
hold of our
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh state representative our
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
representatives in washington and uh let
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
them know that this is an important
 
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.190 align:start position:0%
them know that this is an important
subject

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
what i don't like about it is that it is
 
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.750 align:start position:0%
what i don't like about it is that it is
uh

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
directed only at solar panels there are
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
so many other uh
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
things that we need to recycle which are
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
just as dangerous we also don't know
 
00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:24.870 align:start position:0%
just as dangerous we also don't know
what

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
the expense is going to be for recycling
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
30 years from now
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
i suspect that instead of costing us
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
money there may be value in those panels
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
and so what do we do now should we start
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
paying the installers for
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
installing a product that's going to be
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
worth some money at the end of their
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
life i don't think so so why don't we
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
just look into this a little bit more
 
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.109 align:start position:0%
just look into this a little bit more
to

00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
determine what the real costs are going
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.630 align:start position:0%
to be
and

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
i suppose you could call it kicking it
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
down the road but i don't think we're
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
ready for this i think it's a bad bill
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mann
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yeah i have the
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
same opinion i also feel that
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
as a previous representative
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
i also feel that with a little time we
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
might have some idea about what
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
the implications are perhaps
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of these panels will be moved and
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
used in other
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
facilities maybe we'd take our panels
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
off every 10 years and
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
some farmer would have
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
a growing wall on his
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
on his barn that
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
is full of old panels i mean it's just
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
the whole problem is we're not
 
00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:48.790 align:start position:0%
the whole problem is we're not
understood

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
understood
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
you don't know what the problem looks
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
like you don't know how it how things
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
will work out you don't know what kind
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
of solutions will be available in the 20
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oxenam had her
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
hand up first
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i've handed out a
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
hand up before the beginning of this
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
meeting which is an advertisement from
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
one particular company that is called we
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
recycle solar they have a nationwide
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
service they handle every need from pv
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
panels to energy storage blah blah blah
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
because this is a profitable industry
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
with financial return i don't see the
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
reason for the state to be sticking its
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
nose in here i don't see the reason for
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
a mandate and i think that if if if we
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
don't itl the bill i think i i would
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
support my fellow representatives who
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
suggest interim study
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bernardi is
 
00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:49.670 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bernardi is
recognized

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a contrary point of
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
view i think it is time for us to take a
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
stand on
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
moving these kinds of programs forward i
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
think as representative plett has
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is a
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.150 align:start position:0%
this is a
initial

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
stand on an issue which we shouldn't be
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
kicking down the road it can be built
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
upon for dealing with battery issues
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
which are also going to
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
raise a significant problem in the
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
future or already are in various
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
landfills or light bulbs containing
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
mercury or other things which are
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to recycle in and difficult to
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
manage in local landfills we need to
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
to initiate this kind of a
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
process this is a good first step we can
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
make course corrections and additions as
 
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.069 align:start position:0%
make course corrections and additions as
needed

00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
to represent kelly pitt's point with
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
futures market uh petroleum skyrocketing
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing anything we do right now to
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
stabilize our energy market is being
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
critical and that means supporting both
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
renewable and non-renewable energy um
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
i see this as a crisis situation and i
 
00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.230 align:start position:0%
i see this as a crisis situation and i
don't

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
want to put the thumb on any particular
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
industry by saying we're going to
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
restrict how we're going to produce
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
energy i think it's
 
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.430 align:start position:0%
energy i think it's
critical

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
critical
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
to john mann's point
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
i solar panels they don't have the
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
built-in obsolescence from my
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
observation they don't have that
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
built-in obsolescence that many of our
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
products that are cluttered or landfill
 
00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:26.790 align:start position:0%
products that are cluttered or landfill
have

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
and even at the end of their life they
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
still are producing
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
and they are built
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
to survive unlike
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
the printer in my office right now
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
so by placing your thumb on the local
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
solar industry i think it's engaging in
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
bad economics
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
and making new hampshire less
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
competitive in regard to other states
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
i wish we could send this interim study
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that i think is
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
really important
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
is that we should be looking on a
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
regional level
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:10.150 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
i don't want i i can't imagine what it's
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
going to cost
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
materials panels computers and what it
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
costs to send it to chicago or to send
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
it to washington state or to send it to
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
arizona when these recycling facilities
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
are built they don't just recycle one
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
thing they recycle many things and the
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
recycling of solar panels in particular
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
is very important because of what they
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
can gain from it there is value in that
 
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.109 align:start position:0%
can gain from it there is value in that
material

00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
material
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
more value than is in
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know we used to say what the human
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
body was worth now it's worth about 32
 
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.510 align:start position:0%
body was worth now it's worth about 32
cents

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
cents
 
00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.630 align:start position:0%
cents
um

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of value in that material
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
many companies are interested in buying
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
buying that
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
so there are many different ways
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
i believe have to figure out
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
how to charge for this maybe five
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
dollars on is unreasonable too little
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
maybe fifty dollars is too much
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
maybe added installation cost right now
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
is a hammer that we don't need
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
but i think a regional solution
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
and i think we could instruct very
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
easily not instruct we could ask
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
des to look at the situation
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
and look how much would it cost to have
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
a regional
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
recycling facility
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
for the new england states or maybe
 
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.309 align:start position:0%
for the new england states or maybe
beyond

00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
that would be worth money to the company
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's going to do that
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
and i i think that
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
us putting that kind of money
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
on anybody and i don't know how much it
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
would cost
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
we don't know how much it would cost or
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
add to the installation and right now
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
people are choking to death and i i'm
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
going to tell you that from personal
 
00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.750 align:start position:0%
going to tell you that from personal
experience

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know um i used to love to take a
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
ride up to the mountains and just look
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
at the beauty of this state i don't do
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
that anymore i ca i don't think i can do
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
that anymore if gas goes up another 50
 
00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:21.589 align:start position:0%
that anymore if gas goes up another 50
cents

00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
cents
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
you know for some people that's a lot of
 
00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.150 align:start position:0%
you know for some people that's a lot of
money

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
so the thought of putting in
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
a solar panel
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
and having those prices go way up
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
and we don't know how much right now is
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
inexpedient i don't want i don't think
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
this should be killed i think it should
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
be put into interim study
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
and i believe that interim study is
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thomas thank
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
i um
 
00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.670 align:start position:0%
i um
probably

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
i would think i'd like to to uh correct
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
my good friend from portsmouth i think
 
00:45:02.309 --> 00:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
due to inflation i think the human body
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
is probably worth a hundred dollars now
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
compared to all the inflation we're
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
having but i would like to state
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
i would like to state one thing though
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass this bill now
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
it is my opinion that this discussion
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
dies if we pass this bill
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
we can have further discussion
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
and we can perhaps come up with perhaps
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
a better plan but if we don't pass this
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill now the discussion will die i feel
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
it because people want to kick this can
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
down the road i think the discussion
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be to begin now
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps a study might come out of it
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
but we need to pass it in order to have
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
more discussion
 
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.190 align:start position:0%
more discussion
uh

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
by the next level of our friends so i'm
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
the committee will be in order please
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.349 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
chairman

00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
um i'm just taking in all the all the
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
comments that have been made and i want
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
to go back to representative thomas's
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
comment about this being a visionary
 
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.230 align:start position:0%
comment about this being a visionary
bill

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
i think we've already discussed several
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
times that there's a difference of
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
opinion on the committee about what the
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
vision should be for energy policy
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
coming out of this committee
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
and i would argue that
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
our solar uptake or our solar
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
penetration in new hampshire is
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
extremely low
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
because we haven't fully supported
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
the adoption of solar in the state and
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
that has everything to do with uh the
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
policies that we put in place and the
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
objectives that we have
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
many of us think that the the can that's
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
been kicked down the road is the warming
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
of the atmosphere and its effects on
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
everything else we also have a
 
00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion about how to go
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
about creating
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
the appropriate mix of energy
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
and so what this bill does though
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
is it takes an energy source that is a
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
non-emitting source
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
that has helped new hampshire have an
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
energy portfolio diversity
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
we were trying
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
15 years ago the discussions were around
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
increasing our portfolio diversity so
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have all our eggs in one
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
basket in gas or oil or coal
 
00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.670 align:start position:0%
basket in gas or oil or coal
and

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
we've kind of fallen off having any
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
discussions around what our objectives
 
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.470 align:start position:0%
discussions around what our objectives
are

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
and we're sort of backpedaling on the
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
pieces of our portfolio pie that create
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
that clean diversity that we that was
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
the objective in the past
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
so rather than increasing that section
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're adopting policies that take us in
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
the other direction and make us more
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel dependent and so i would say
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's the opposite of visionary because
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
that it's okay for us to go down the
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
road of of adopting
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
more fossil fuel
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
dependence at a time when the costs
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
there are going up and i don't think
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
that that does a service to the people
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
that we represent because
 
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
portfolio diversity was the way we were
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
keeping our costs down because we were
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
allowing people to have competition in
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
the market and options for how they got
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
their energy
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
solved so i just want to say that that's
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
the context in which i view the bill
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
when you add costs to something to a
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
market that's costs have been coming
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
down in terms of their ability to
 
00:48:21.119 --> 00:48:22.390 align:start position:0%
down in terms of their ability to
compete

00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
compete
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
then you
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
move the decisions
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
in the other direction and i think
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
that is the can that we do not want to
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
kick down the road so that's what i have
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd remind you uh the members
 
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.190 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd remind you uh the members
that

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
one part of the vision is
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
in my belief and has to be
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy and we did pass a bill
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
earlier this session to study
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
how we can
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
acquire more
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy in our state
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
mann yes
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to pay in advance for
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
recycling when we put the panels up
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
and my question would be how in the heck
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
do we know what the recycling costs are
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
i mean it seems to me that just to
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
implement this it really needs to be put
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
into an interim study so we have some
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
idea what we're talking about when we
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.510 align:start position:0%
talk about
prepayment

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
prepayment
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
for all of the
 
00:49:27.119 --> 00:49:28.390 align:start position:0%
for all of the
recycling

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:32.230 align:start position:0%
recycling
needs

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see how that can be escaped
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
frankly mr chairman i don't know whether
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar i know this is i might
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
be completely wrong but i'm surprised at
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
how much you participate in debates
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
and whether as a chairman that's
 
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.069 align:start position:0%
and whether as a chairman that's
appropriate

00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
i'm a member of this legislature i
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
represent my constituents i'm entitled
 
00:49:58.960 --> 00:49:59.829 align:start position:0%
represent my constituents i'm entitled
to

00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:59.839 --> 00:50:00.870 align:start position:0%
to
debate

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
debate
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
issues that are relevant to my
 
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.430 align:start position:0%
issues that are relevant to my
constituents

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
issue all i'm saying is it's not
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
familiar to me thank you you're welcome
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki uh thank you mr
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
chairman uh i do have questions uh two
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
points really one of which is i asked
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
earlier when we were discussing the bill
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know what are the what is the value
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
of the components and the other thing is
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
that in a lot of cases what we're doing
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
is essentially moving pollution to
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
someplace else we do that with some of
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
our you know hydro generation we do the
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
same thing when we're buying things from
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
china where it's the wild west and um
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know there's no real control over
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
the environmental issues and um
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
you know it's a real question and i
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
believe that it we can put it into
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents we may be able to
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
understand it better
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
an answer
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
i can't answer because i'm not expert at
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of this of taking this stuff
 
00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.430 align:start position:0%
the cost of this of taking this stuff
apart

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
apart
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh and and the value of the different uh
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
rare elements that are in the rare earth
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
elements that they're listed in the bill
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's something for experts to do but
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
representative accident
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just go back to the
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
advertisement these
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
there are lots and lots of very valuable
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
things in these panels and there are
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
businesses who it is their business
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
model to reclaim them in a sustainable
 
00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.630 align:start position:0%
model to reclaim them in a sustainable
way

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
it is profitable and responsible to do
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to step in with the
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
state we don't need to step in with
 
00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:52.950 align:start position:0%
state we don't need to step in with
mandates

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative oxenam
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
one would assume that a stewardship plan
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
would certainly include that kind of uh
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
activity it seems like like at this
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
point that we're going around and around
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
and making the same arguments over and
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
over and we are nearing the end of our
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
allocated time so i would like to call
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
the question and have uh
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts have the
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
final word before we do that
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's not the final word i i think
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
everybody knows how i feel i just had a
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
real question
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
when a panel is removed from a roof
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
does that panel have to be removed by a
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
person who is licensed
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
i i don't know
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
if there's damage on that roof
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it be the person
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
who takes that panel off
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
who might be responsible for what to do
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.430 align:start position:0%
with it
i

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
have never seen a panel in action but i
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
know that they're connected to the
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
electricity system so do we have to have
 
00:53:01.599 --> 00:53:02.790 align:start position:0%
electricity system so do we have to have
someone

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
who is responsible and licensed to that
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
and then wouldn't it be more appropriate
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
for that person who is removing that
 
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.710 align:start position:0%
for that person who is removing that
panel

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
panel
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
to take care of it i don't know if many
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
people just rip them down themselves
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
imagine there's all sorts of scenarios
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
out there and generally an electrician
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
is required to fool around with
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
electricity but for a homeowner that's
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
not necessarily so they can go do that
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh the point is is there'll be funds
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
available to recycle these properly
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh at the end of en end of life and if
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
if the homeowner is damaged to his or
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
her roof
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
she or he does damage to the roof but
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully somebody responsible will take
 
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
that down and knowing the fund is there
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
they'll do the right thing
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
okay so having given representative
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%

01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy the
 
01:06:47.119 --> 01:06:48.390 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy the
uh

01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
arborist from
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
eversource and uh
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
where miss ms gamache will introduce him
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
to our committee thank you very briefly
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
with me is probably one of the um
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
most popular employees at eversource
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
because he's very passionate about what
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
he does bob allen manager of vegetation
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
management thanks
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr allen
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
welcome the floor is yours thank you
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you donna
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's about the best introduction i've
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
ever had except for the time i had to do
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
myself when the speaker wasn't there so
 
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.789 align:start position:0%
myself when the speaker wasn't there so
um

01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you for having me um what i
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to do was talk a little bit about
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
eversource's vegetation management
 
01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:31.990 align:start position:0%
eversource's vegetation management
program

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
and i've brought some handouts today for
 
01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.109 align:start position:0%
and i've brought some handouts today for
you

01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
but this powerpoint that i put together
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
gives us some background on what we do
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
with the program and maybe give you some
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
idea of some of the things we're up
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
against and some of the things that we
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
help out on in the state so
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
um if everybody's ready the first slide
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's the eversource franchise territory
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
so 13 220 square mile operational area
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
we have 40 000 miles of overhead line
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
across three states
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
500 communities
 
01:08:05.119 --> 01:08:05.910 align:start position:0%
500 communities
so

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're on about a four to five year cycle
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
across the three states so that means
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're doing 10 000 miles a year of
 
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.270 align:start position:0%
we're doing 10 000 miles a year of
trimming

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
trimming
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
36 employees we just bumped that up
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
we're about 42 right now internal
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
and 475 contractor tree crews working
 
01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:21.990 align:start position:0%
and 475 contractor tree crews working
across

01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
across
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
connecticut mass and new hampshire every
 
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.470 align:start position:0%
connecticut mass and new hampshire every
day

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
a forest cover so percent tree cover
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
state rank this is something that the
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
u.s forest service does every 10 years
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
or so and it goes back and forth between
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and maine as number one
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
i preferred new hampshire to be number
 
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
one so that's where they are in this
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
particular slide
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
connecticut's number five i mean
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
massachusetts number six not everybody
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
would think of that as being those
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
heavily forested areas but it's based on
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
an aerial photo
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
and it's the cover the percent of forest
 
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.590 align:start position:0%
and it's the cover the percent of forest
cover

01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
and then the wildland urban interface
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
rank is uh connecticut number one
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts number two in new
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire number four and that speaks to
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
how close is uh forested area or natural
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
area to where people live that is a very
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
densely populated small
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
state and so there's where there is
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
forest that's very close to where
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
there's people living but massachusetts
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
same thing in new hampshire is number
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
four on that
 
01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
so what we like to say is this means our
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
customers live amongst the trees
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
we believe there's 175 trees per mile
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
when we trim
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
and a mile for this
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
argument or statistic is uh
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
30 pole sections so if you were to go
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
down the street and count 30 pole
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
sections and general that's about a mile
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's 20 sometimes it's 40 but
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
we go with 30. so 175 trees on average
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
every mile a line we're trimming
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
so that gives you over 7 million trees
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
for maintenance each cycle
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
but the thing that
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
we all we've all experienced is an
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
outage caused by the weather in a tree
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
is there's three to four times that
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
number in the fall zone
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
so what's the fall zone it's a 50 foot
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
tree 40 feet from the wires that would
 
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
be considered in the fall zone
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
so that's 21 million trees on any given
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
day that could fall and hit our wires
 
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:16.950 align:start position:0%
day that could fall and hit our wires
so

01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
when you go through an outage please try
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
and remember me and trying to take care
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
of those 21 million trees so
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
um the mission uh so we i don't want to
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
bore you with too much stuff but what
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is effectively plan
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
schedule and manage services
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
so that we can take care of the trees
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
that are going to affect our wires
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
and therefore affect our customers
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
we have best management practices for
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
our t and d line clearance and t is
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
transmission d is distribution
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
transmission is over hill and dale the
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
big lines
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
distribution will be the lines that come
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
from the substation down the roads and
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
then into your house
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
we develop customer relations practices
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
deploy multi-channel communication
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
community outreach to facilitate field
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
execution vegetation management
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
activities what that says is once in a
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
while we put a picture on facebook and
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh and tell you that we're doing a good
 
01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.990 align:start position:0%
uh and tell you that we're doing a good
job

01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.270 align:start position:0%
job
so

01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
we hire arborists
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
everybody goes to school for trees that
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
we hire
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
some of them might be wildlife ecology
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
some might be environmental science but
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
we're hiring arborists so our tree
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
people are looking after the tree people
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
that are doing the work
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
so we're very proud of our
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
professionalism on that
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
and then lastly we have performance
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
metrics and those are called sadie and
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
safety we love acronyms in the utility
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
world and i'll get to explaining what
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
so managing the business of vegetation
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
management and these are these circles
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much tell you what we're up
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
against every day and what we're trying
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
to manage every day so that's customer
 
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.149 align:start position:0%
to manage every day so that's customer
satisfaction

01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
satisfaction
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
if the customers are happy then the new
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
folks are probably not hearing from them
 
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
and that's a good thing
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
reliability usually people are happy
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
when the power is reliable
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
storm resiliency if the storms don't
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
knock us out for as long as they used to
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
before we had the projects the way we do
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
good infrastructure building and a
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
really an aggressive tree program that
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't have prior to the 2008 ice
 
01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.550 align:start position:0%
we didn't have prior to the 2008 ice
storm

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
storm
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
compliance quality control cost con are
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
all things that i deal with every day
 
01:12:16.239 --> 01:12:17.110 align:start position:0%
all things that i deal with every day
and

01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
as do our arborist so
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
on the next slide it's the key
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
reliability metrics and
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
as i said safety and sadie so safety
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
if i break it down it's uh and i'm sorry
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't number these slides i should
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
have um make it easier when i'm zipping
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
through them but
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
safety is system average interruption
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
frequency index
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
i didn't learn anything about that in
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
tree school
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then number three trouble spots and
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
then sadie would be system average
 
01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.189 align:start position:0%
then sadie would be system average
interruption

01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
interruption
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
duration index
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
so looking at the graphs uh the red was
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
the blue was the 2020 the deep blue was
 
01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
the 2021 actual so we didn't make our
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
goal last year
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
and that's unfortunate but we did have a
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
good year
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're very much a continuous improvement
 
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.350 align:start position:0%
we're very much a continuous improvement
company

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.229 align:start position:0%
company
and

01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
in 2019 we had our best year ever
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
for reliability some of that's climates
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
some of its storms not being as
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
bad some of it's our trimming program
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
but we improved by 40 over our previous
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
best year
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
so now when you put a goal two years
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
later you're not gonna it's not gonna be
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
easy to get that goal
 
01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.189 align:start position:0%
easy to get that goal
so

01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
vegetation impact on reliability are
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
tree related outages so forty five
 
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
percent of outages on distribution are
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
due to vegetation across three states
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's twenty thousand outages a year
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
and ninety percent of outages during
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
but looking at this tree related safety
 
01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
on this particular bar graph it shows
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
that our target was the blue line
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
and from 2016 on and that's when we
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
really started investing in
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
our strategy of taking down hazard trees
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
we've really improved our target and
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
again 2019 stands out as the best year
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
that speaks the amount of trees in the
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
fall zone
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
that we hadn't been looking to get in
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
the past and now we're looking deep for
 
01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.270 align:start position:0%
the past and now we're looking deep for
trees

01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
we have key internal partners obviously
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
veg we work with everybody
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%

01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
so i put this little blurb in there
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
about millions of connecticut trees have
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
been killed or damaged in recent years
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
taking them down is expensive
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
so there's i've worked in connecticut
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
and in mass and up in new hampshire i've
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
i've been with the company for 35 years
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
and connecticut and massachusetts have
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
different rules as far as the the way
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
the roads are laid out and i'm probably
 
01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.070 align:start position:0%
the roads are laid out and i'm probably
gonna

01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
be over generalistic here but in
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
connecticut and mass most
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
roads are three rod roads a rod would be
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
16 and a half feet and a kind of an
 
01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.870 align:start position:0%
16 and a half feet and a kind of an
ancient

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
ancient
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
measurement so three rod road would be
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
sixteen and a half times three forty
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
nine and a half feet let's say fifty
 
01:15:44.159 --> 01:15:45.830 align:start position:0%
nine and a half feet let's say fifty
feet

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
feet
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
and that's in new hampshire too a lot of
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
them are three rod roads however in
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
connecticut and massachusetts about
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
ninety percent of the time
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
those roads are owned by the town
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
or the city
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire it's almost a direct
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
opposite we don't have as many roads
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
that are owned that way so
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
in that three rods in connecticut
 
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts there's 25 to 30 feet of
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
traveled way 10 feet on either side
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
for a snow shelf sidewalk tree belt
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
those trees in there are owned by the
 
01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.830 align:start position:0%
those trees in there are owned by the
town

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
and therefore they have a tree warden in
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
each town in connecticut and
 
01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:19.189 align:start position:0%
each town in connecticut and
massachusetts

01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we don't have that
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
situation more often than not if if i
 
01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
lived across from the chairman
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
you would own 25 feet to the side of the
 
01:16:28.149 --> 01:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
road and i would own 25 feet to the side
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
of the road and the town would have an
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
easement over our property and those
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
trees would actually be mine and yours
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
so so it's a little bit different when
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
we look at that but the reason i put
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
this in there is
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
what happened down there was uh the
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
drought we had a horrible drought in
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
2016 2017
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
they have emerald ash borer which has
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
now been in
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for a few years in the
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
whole states and
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
it's not a quarantine anymore the whole
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
state's got it every county
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
they had gypsy moth which i just found
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
out last week is not the correct
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
term anymore it's now called spongy moth
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
because gypsy is not politically correct
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
so um which is fine i just
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
40 years in this business i got to start
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
calling a bug sponge you know
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
i know then we'll have trouble
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
so um so the spongy moth the emerald ash
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
borer and the drought contributed to
 
01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
thousands of trees that died in
 
01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.950 align:start position:0%
thousands of trees that died in
connecticut

01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:25.830 align:start position:0%
connecticut
and

01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
eversource doesn't own any trees as i
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
stated the trees that are owned they're
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
owned by either the town or the
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
property owner
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
so we worked really hard to try and work
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
with the states and the towns to work
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
together and take these trees down so
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we're working on one side of
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
the road where the wires are but there's
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
dead trees on the other side too
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
and they can fall over and hit us and
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
so we we've tried to partner with the
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
state and the town whenever possible
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
some towns are easier to partner with
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
than others some states are easier to
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
partner with those i've always been very
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
successful up here partnering with new
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire and it's the reason i'm here i
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
like it and
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
but i want you to know that that's
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
something that's going on emerald ash
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
borer is a big problem in new hampshire
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's gotten worse
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
if you listen to kyle lombard who's the
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
state forest health insect specialist he
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
says um that 30 of the urban forest is
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
ash in new hampshire
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
six percent of the forest is ash but
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
um so we've got a lot of trees out there
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
by the roads that are failing quick
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
question for you does that ash borer
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
kill the trees
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
yes it does okay so it
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
what it does
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
it bores in it's a flathead bore so it
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
comes out with a
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
like a half moon looking shaped hole
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes out it's not a round hole
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
so it comes out and it
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's young live inside the galleries
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
that it's developed and that stops the
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
phloem from going up so similarly like
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
the dutch elm disease was a vascular
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
disease animal dashboard can do the same
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
problem can cause the same problem so
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
trees die within two to three years you
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
notice it by something called blonding
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe you guys have seen this
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
but woodpeckers go after
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
the bugs that are inside and they go
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much in a straight line and
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
you'll see the bark turn from gray to
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
yellowish so if you see blonding on an
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
ash you know you've got emerald ash
 
01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:15.590 align:start position:0%
ash you know you've got emerald ash
borer

01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
borer
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
because the woodpeckers are pretty smart
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
when it comes to food
 
01:19:19.199 --> 01:19:21.430 align:start position:0%
when it comes to food
so

01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
again i don't know
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
i know some pockets of areas in the
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
state where there's problems with it
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
already but i think it's going to grow
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
into a bigger a bigger problem yeah if i
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
may uh so so you notice you have one
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
tree that's got the blonde
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
do you call someone to get rid of it or
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
do you just let it
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
grow a good question so
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
you want to get rid of it if you can
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
what we used to have to do was chip it
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
and either leave it right there or take
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
it to a spot where you could only it
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
couldn't cross county lines now but the
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
every county has it so it's not as much
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
of an issue
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'd hate to say this but the ashes are
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult to save as a
 
01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:03.590 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult to save as a
species

01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
species
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
with this particular bug
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's certainly ones you can say this
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
one is really important to us we want to
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
save it and we're going to pay to do
 
01:20:14.229 --> 01:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
or not um
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
the pine bore out west yes
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's a similar situation yes but i know
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
i understand that the pine bore it's a
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
reproductive life
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
used to be that's one season one mating
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and now with the extended uh
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
summers it's once uh one summer two
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
matings yeah twice as many insects
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
is your emerald ash borer or a similar
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
situation as far as you're aware that's
 
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
a great question as far as i know not
 
01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.510 align:start position:0%
a great question as far as i know not
yet

01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
it potentially could be but i think it
 
01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh they overwinter as eggs or larvae in
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the tree and then they come out so i
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
think they have to over winter for one
 
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
think they have to over winter for one
year

01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure of that i'll look that
 
01:20:55.199 --> 01:20:56.229 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure of that i'll look that
up

01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:20:56.239 --> 01:20:59.590 align:start position:0%
up
yep

01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
any other insect bug questions yeah
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
if you said if you chip one of the
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
affected trees yeah the does the larvae
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the eggs still stay on the on the on
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
the floor and they go to other trees
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
they can't leave really so you chip it
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
into one pile and they just are staying
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
there probably not gonna live okay
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's the thought process but okay
 
01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:20.870 align:start position:0%
that's the thought process but okay
yes

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead fred
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
is there uh
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
any predator uh any uh controlling
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
another bug that would control the first
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
one yeah so there's there's always
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
natural predators for these types of
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
things we haven't been able to release
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
anything yet on emerald ash borer that
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
has made a difference
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
there are other things such as purple
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
loosestrife which is a invasive species
 
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in the state for years
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
and the state of zx doug saigan from
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
invasive species has actually released a
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
bug that will eat that
 
01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it's
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
we've done a good job of controlling
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
that that way but
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find a predator for every
 
01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.149 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find a predator for every
bug

01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
bug
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
because there's always something else
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
that's easier to eat than a bug that's
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
inside a tree so
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
representing ricky thank you mr chairman
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
um what about resistant strains of the
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
actual tree because my neighborhood
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
they've all been gotten except one that
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
i planted about 30 years ago and it
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
seems to be doing okay that's fantastic
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
i maybe can market that one
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
no it's always something that you see
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
that there's some natural resistance
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
there's still elm trees around even
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
though dutch elm swept through this
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
country over the last eight decades
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
there's still occasional elm trees that
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
you see so
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
but i don't know of any strain that's
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily a species or a cultivar
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's been come up with yet on the
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
market that is ash that's resistant
 
01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.510 align:start position:0%
market that is ash that's resistant
yep

01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
i could add to that question knowing
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
that um in my nearby city of king
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
farm who specializes in uh resistant
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
dutch elm uh seedlings and you can buy a
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
dutch elm ceiling from them
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
um but it's a matter of a number of
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
years to be forest uh yep situation yeah
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
the elm research institute in keene was
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh was one of the groups that was doing
 
01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
it for years and also chestnuts they're
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
come that that's come back a long ways
 
01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:10.629 align:start position:0%
come that that's come back a long ways
but

01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
we lose these species because of really
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
because of global
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
commerce i think we bring more bugs in
 
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.910 align:start position:0%
commerce i think we bring more bugs in
so

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
um all right let me go back to this it's
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
a little more boring than what we were
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
so this uh this talks about our
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory programs and basically what i
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
said was it's four to five years
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts four to five years in
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and then four years in
 
01:23:34.159 --> 01:23:35.910 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and then four years in
connecticut

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
and the hardest thing to get that work
 
01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:39.030 align:start position:0%
and the hardest thing to get that work
done

01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
is there's nobody new coming into this
 
01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.310 align:start position:0%
is there's nobody new coming into this
business

01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
this is not a well-paid
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
it's not even a profession in a lot of
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
people's minds being a tree guy
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
and we've fought this for 40 years i've
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
been involved in it it's it the pay just
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
isn't there and we find it harder and
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
harder to get people in i went to
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
stockbridge school of agriculture in
 
01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.470 align:start position:0%
stockbridge school of agriculture in
umass

01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
umass
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
graduated in 1982 there were 62 people
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
in my major of arbor culture
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
this year there's four
 
01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.510 align:start position:0%
this year there's four
so

01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's thompson school went through a
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
similar situation so it's it's just
 
01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.750 align:start position:0%
similar situation so it's it's just
difficult

01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.189 align:start position:0%
difficult
everybody

01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know wants to have an easier job you
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
got to work outside 12 months a year and
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
with a chainsaw usually a loft and
 
01:24:18.239 --> 01:24:19.270 align:start position:0%
with a chainsaw usually a loft and
so

01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
but if you're passionate about it or you
 
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
like it or you want to be outside you
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't want somebody yelling at you or if
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
they yell at you you can just rub the
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
chainsaw a little more they don't have
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
so our distribution programs as i said
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
we love acronyms so smt is scheduled
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance trimming and that's what we
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
do every day that's our program where we
 
01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.310 align:start position:0%
do every day that's our program where we
trim

01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
trim
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
10 000 miles a year across eversource
 
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire that's going to be
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
around 2 600 miles this year
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
enhanced tree trimming which is along
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
our backbone lines which have the most
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
customers affected
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
those lines are cut and cleared at a
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
greater expanse
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
reliability tree work is something we
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
came up with in massachusetts we don't
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
do it in new hampshire yet
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
regular tree removal we're looking for
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
hazard and risk trees
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
right away maintenance again we're going
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
over hill and dale and we're mowing
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
and and climbing trees in that area
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
mid-cycle is usually for us it's usually
 
01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.550 align:start position:0%
mid-cycle is usually for us it's usually
vines

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
vines
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
that bother us between the cycles and
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
again we have the vine program also yes
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead fred
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
having been a former employee
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
a hundred years ago
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh i do know that most of your
 
01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.070 align:start position:0%
uh i do know that most of your
distribution

01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of your distribution is 34 and a
 
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
half kv yes uh as opposed to massive
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
other states around us it might be 12 or
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
even 4kv which means is that does that
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
mean more of it is subject to enhanced
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
tree trimming you've got more customers
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
on a line
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
and uh more
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
chance for interruption because there's
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
more customers on the line so that
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
higher voltage whether it's the 34 5 or
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
23 but you're right most states around
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
us do not have 345 on the roadside
 
01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:55.990 align:start position:0%
us do not have 345 on the roadside
but

01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's from our backbone is considered
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
from the source usually the substation
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
down to the first operating device which
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
could be a fuse or a re-closure or
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
something so any customers in that area
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
is where we're getting the higher
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
clearance zone because we can impact so
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
many more people
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
if we lose the line there that's going
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
to be a big outage so
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
cali pits
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not a tree expert at all i like
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
trees is the shade
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
and the fruit they bear
 
01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.470 align:start position:0%
and the fruit they bear
but

01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
i what concerns me is you are an
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
arborist and you say there's not many
 
01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.709 align:start position:0%
arborist and you say there's not many
coming

01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
but the contractors that are hired by
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
the company
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to say it choppers
 
01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.229 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to say it choppers
and

01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
that's is that where some of the
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
controversy comes in that
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
as p have you looked at every place that
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be trimmed or has somebody
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
of your caliber looked at every place
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
that needs to be trimmed and then you
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
rely on your contractors to
 
01:27:08.639 --> 01:27:09.750 align:start position:0%
rely on your contractors to
follow

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
your directives and that doesn't always
 
01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.030 align:start position:0%
your directives and that doesn't always
happen

01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
so yeah i think like any profession
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be a day where
 
01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
somebody's not having their best day so
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
that can happen but
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
the contractors bid on our work we give
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
them the specifications it's and then
 
01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:23.830 align:start position:0%
them the specifications it's and then
this

01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
led right into the next slide which is
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
great um
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
so it's our distribution programs which
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
show uh eight feet to the side of the
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
wires 10 feet below the wires and 15
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
feet above the wires and
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
and our our wires are always at the top
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
of the pole electric wires are always on
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
the top
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh phone wires are always on the bottom
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
and then could be cable or a fire or
 
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
something in between but we're always on
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
the top
 
01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
the top
so

01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
we do 100 quality control audits if the
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
work was trimmed this year we're out
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
well it'll be march 31st everything has
 
01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
to be looked at from 2021 by march 31st
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
is the way we do it so you can't
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
obviously if you're trimming on december
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
20th you're not going to be able to get
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
out there and look at it if you're
 
01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
looking at stuff from november's
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
trimming so we give ourselves a couple
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
months to take care of it and then we
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
send the contractor back
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
to fix anything that we find we call it
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
a go back
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
anything that hits the go back list or
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
the punch list as we might call it also
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
is something that's done on their nickel
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
we don't pay for it they have to go back
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
and do it
 
01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:25.510 align:start position:0%
and do it
and

01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
these specifications uh as i oftentimes
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
tell the guys haven't changed since 1986
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the tremors were born since
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
then so they've only known this
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
specification but it seems like
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes they struggle with it so yeah
 
01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.270 align:start position:0%
sometimes they struggle with it so yeah
we're

01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's a profession and or it's a craft
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to learn and some
 
01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.590 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to learn and some
guys

01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
guys
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
um have have tougher days than other
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
guys some guys are better at it than
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
other guys so
 
01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:49.350 align:start position:0%
other guys so
um

01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
but we look at 100 of everything so if
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
there's a problem and we haven't heard
 
01:28:54.149 --> 01:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
about it from our customers we'll find
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
our ett excuse me is enhanced tree
 
01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.030 align:start position:0%
our ett excuse me is enhanced tree
trimming

01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
trimming
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
and that is required to get permission
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
from the landowner
 
01:29:08.239 --> 01:29:09.510 align:start position:0%
from the landowner
and

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
and they want the free firewood they
 
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:16.550 align:start position:0%
and they want the free firewood they
want

01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
lose the risk of the tree coming down
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
they've been dealing with the leaves or
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
the acorns or they're dropping something
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
every day
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
and if they're on a backbone line as i
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
said we're looking to take those trees
 
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:26.950 align:start position:0%
said we're looking to take those trees
down

01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
if they're a hazard to us
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they're hazard because of
 
01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.910 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they're hazard because of
their

01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
species because of their proximity
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
because of the soil they're growing in
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
or other issues that might have happened
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
but we're looking at for ett we do about
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
the next slide we have tree removals
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
this is over 50 000 trees removed
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
annually that's across three states
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
but you can see some of those trees we
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
have marked on the left-hand system
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
our left-hand side
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
have ribbons on them we generally use
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
blue and white ribbons now
 
01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
they're checkered
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
and the reason we've done that is
 
01:30:04.239 --> 01:30:05.030 align:start position:0%
and the reason we've done that is
because

01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
lots of people put if we were using
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
orange they'll put orange on theirs and
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
hope that we're going to take it down
 
01:30:10.639 --> 01:30:11.590 align:start position:0%
hope that we're going to take it down
so

01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.550 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
so blue and white is not as easy to find
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
and it's expensive so we we use are more
 
01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
expensive than the other stuff so we use
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
so quick question yes what happens to 50
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
000 trees is a lot of trees what happens
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
to all the
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
the wood is it chipped is it
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
how do you deal with it so a lot of
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
times we have people trying to get their
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
pickup truck right underneath it before
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
we take it down uh and we usually don't
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
have any problem getting rid of the wood
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
even now with we used to have problems
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
with white pine
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
because not not anybody want to burn
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
that but now with the wood boilers those
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
folks will burn anything
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
maple producers they don't mind it
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
usually they have their own sources but
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
if we're nearby they'll take some wood
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
from us
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
some of it goes we can't sell it and we
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
don't have any interest in selling it we
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
want it to be given away or have
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
somebody use it we have explored
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
um what's known as wood banks
 
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
and we've delivered wood to wood banks
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
and there's one in the antrum a few
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
years ago we didn't it used to be a
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
thing in connecticut where they were
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
taking homeless men taking them off the
 
01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:17.990 align:start position:0%
taking homeless men taking them off the
street

01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
street
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
at a thing called open hearth and they
 
01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:20.470 align:start position:0%
at a thing called open hearth and they
were

01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
giving them a chance to
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
become part of society again by cutting
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
and splitting wood and then delivering
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
it and selling it so we were donating
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
wood to the open hearth
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
and they were there's a big program they
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
had to manage the whole thing and give
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
these folks places to stay and feed them
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
but they earned money and they became
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
part of the society again um
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
we've never really found a way to do
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
that in any other state it's it's a it's
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
a big undertaking and in new hampshire
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
where a lot of people burn wood and i i
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
mean i burn seven or eight cords a year
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i buy it i don't get it for free
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's always somebody who wants the
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
wood and as far as the chips
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
our chips are very popular
 
01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:02.550 align:start position:0%
our chips are very popular
with

01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
folks that have berry bushes blueberries
 
01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.709 align:start position:0%
folks that have berry bushes blueberries
especially

01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
christmas tree farms like them and one
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
of the things that's happened in my 40
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
years of doing this is
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
people have started to go away from the
 
01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
wanting the black mulch or the red mulch
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
or the it's got dye in it they want
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
natural stuff it's really native
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
oriented now so
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
our chips are becoming more popular even
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
though they're not landscape quality and
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
they might be a little
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
messy at times there might be some twigs
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
in there or something but it's better
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
because it's the organic matter is going
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
right back into the soil so we're
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
finding more outlets for that
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
distribution programs are right away
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
maintenance and if i'm taking too long
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
please let me know i'm happy to stay
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
here all day but um
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
so we're not using herbicide in new
 
01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.870 align:start position:0%
so we're not using herbicide in new
hampshire

01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:49.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire
um

01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
the other utilities do we haven't uh for
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
going on three or four decades now so we
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
just mow
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
with what's known as a brontosaurus
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
by john brown company out of goffstown
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
they they created the machine and most
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
mowing is a benign term when it comes to
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
what they're doing out there but it's uh
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
the sheep so the sheep
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
the sheep was a great idea um it was
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
so it was par
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
let me if i can take a minute when i
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
came up here it had
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
been closed off uh i don't know maybe it
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
yeah it was early
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
and it was it was a partnership with us
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
in unh to get your goat
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
to find out if it was um it was viable
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible certainly it seemed
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
like it was responsible to take care of
 
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
the right-of-ways that way but well it
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
was fiscally responsible to do it that
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
way and um
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
three years of study and it proved to
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
not be
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
at all because the the sheep
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
um wanted to eat
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
forbs and weeds and grasses not stuff
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
that was ever going to come up into the
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
power line
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
i've been trying to work with a cross
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
between a sheep and a beaver and if i
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
can ever get that
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to put that out there but
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
you mentioned goats and goats are being
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
used for poison ivy control in boston in
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
the city parks and it's it's worked out
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
really well
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
um but again the stuff grows back and
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
and with the sheep
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
with us it just wasn't fast enough they
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
kept going back to the same area they
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't move that far down the road so
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
but one of the coolest things when i
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
when i did one of our guys steve johnson
 
01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:38.550 align:start position:0%
when i did one of our guys steve johnson
retired

01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
retired
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
and they sent over to me his vegetation
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
management files and the official top
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
secret name of that was
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
operation lamb chop
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
emergent work so that's the type of work
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
we don't have planned capital
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
construction when somebody comes in
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
wants to develop a new area customer
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
requests municipal partnering as i
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned some of those trees that we
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
take down are partnering with towns and
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
so our outage investigations are
 
01:35:12.310 --> 01:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
something we do and across three states
 
01:35:15.669 --> 01:35:15.679 align:start position:0%
in 2020 this is from we did 110 outage
 
01:35:15.679 --> 01:35:17.030 align:start position:0%
in 2020 this is from we did 110 outage
investigations

01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
this is outages caused by trees that
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
knocked power out to over 100 customers
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
so our arbors go out there they look at
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
the area they decide what the tree
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh caused where it came from
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
and were there any other issues there
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
that we don't want the customers to
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
expect who have another outage just
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
because there's a bad tree in the same
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
zone so
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
what we found were 77 from outside the
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
clearance zone 60 from outside zone are
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
three failures
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
37 percent were limb breaks
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
23 from inside the clearance zone 50
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
percent were limb brakes and 42 percent
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
of tree failures
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
so one of the reasons we have them
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
inside the zone is we don't have a truck
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
that goes up high enough we have 70 foot
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
booms but we really can't get much
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
higher than that so when we try and get
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
ground to sky clearance on our ett it's
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you mr allen
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
for this lovely presentation
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
um this just made me think of uh we came
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
for a visit at eversource and we took a
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
look at the technology that allows folks
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
to isolate you know the outages on the
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
line and i'm just curious how much that
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
technology informs the work that you do
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me when i look at
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
this you know outage investigation piece
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
that you may have people
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
who from that software would be able to
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
say oh i know where that i mean is it
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
down to that kind of level it absolutely
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
is and we're working towards that where
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to start to look at
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
i never want to predict against mother
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
nature but we're going to try and figure
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
out where we're having issues and and
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
talking about kyle lombard from the
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
state we got his heat map on
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
where the insect issues are in a state
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
we're overlaying that on our circuit map
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
so we can see where we're going to trim
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
next and figure out where there might be
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
issues we're also taking weather data
 
01:36:59.910 --> 01:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's great from uconn it's it's that's
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what i was thinking it's like
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
wow if you can do that heat map
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
signature and figure out where the trees
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
are weak
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's terrific for you i just
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
wish you had more people and i wish we
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
could figure out some way to help
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
it be a better paid profession because
 
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's true of a lot of the really most
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
essential professions is that they just
 
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:19.360 align:start position:0%
don't they don't incent enough people to
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
to come into the profession yep and i
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
think one of the issues is osha
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
considers trees as part of waste
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
management so a tree worker is not even
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
a profession in osha we do have our own
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
regulations but
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's never been classified as a high
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
enough profession so
 
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.590 align:start position:0%
enough profession so
um

01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
next one this is usually
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
important to a lot of people this is the
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
service wire the line that comes into
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
your house
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
we don't maintain that as part of our
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
program work and neither do any of the
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
new england utilities there was a time
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
when we did
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
um i remember having a pole saw in the
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
back of my chevy chevette when i first
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
got hired in 1987
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
and i would trim services for folks
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
but we will prune service if there's a
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
hard contact so if that wire should be
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
going like this and a branch makes it go
 
01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
like this or go like that we'll trim
 
01:38:06.639 --> 01:38:07.750 align:start position:0%
like this or go like that we'll trim
that

01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
we don't do removals for service wires
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
but in new hampshire and western mass
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
the company customer can arrange for the
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
company to drop the service wire so
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
we'll come out with knock it we'll take
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
it off the pole take it off your house
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
you take your tree down we put it back
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
up no charge
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
um connecticut and eastern mass they're
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit different they want their
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
money for doing something like that but
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
but we're working on changing that yes
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
because that's got something to do with
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
ownership because in new hampshire
 
01:38:34.239 --> 01:38:36.390 align:start position:0%
ownership because in new hampshire
psnh

01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
psnh
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
the company owns the service drop
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
whereas other states the customer owns
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
the service drop there are certain
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
situations like that where it changes
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the state yep
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
um but we
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough outages on services
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
to make it worthwhile for us to spend
 
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
that kind of money that would take to
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
maintain all the services so we look at
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
everyone if you call in and there you
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
constituent calls in we go out and look
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
at it and frankly if they've got a good
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
story we'll probably do it but um
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's not something we do as a
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
profes as a part of the program
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
um emergency response so as i said we're
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
we're a major part of any storm and
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of storms over the last
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
few years
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that's difficult
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
for us and it's a it's a positive
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
is that these storms
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
that would have knocked us out for a
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
week or two weeks in the past due to the
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
tree trimming we've done due to the
 
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
enhancements to our system as you
 
01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.189 align:start position:0%
enhancements to our system as you
mentioned

01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
they're not taking as much time to get
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
them back in which is great for our
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
customers it makes the storms not as
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
recoverable for us so we bring in a lot
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
of crews
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're not out of power for
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
a long time and then it it becomes a an
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
issue trying to fight to
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
to get some of that back but that's not
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
for today i just want to let you know
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
that we've noticed there's more and more
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
storms that we've been very good at
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
storm that's when we shine and
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
i can't remember the last time i think
 
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
that the ice storm in 2008 was the last
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
time we're out for
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
over a week
 
01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.590 align:start position:0%
over a week
so

01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
vegetation management safety commitment
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
so every year we have an annual safety
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
summit the last two years obviously have
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
been remote
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
but what we do is we bring all the
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
contractors in usually their
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
safety people and their leadership
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
and we talk about what we can do to
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
improve the safety of everybody that's
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
when i first started we never talked
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
contractors never talked to each other
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
if somebody had an accident you'd go all
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
those guys they don't know what they're
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
doing they had an accident now it's so
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
transparent everybody's trying to help
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
each other and we make sure if and this
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
is a bad thing i guess somebody has the
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
biggest accident of the year the next
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
year they have to present on it in front
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
of everybody which gives us lessons
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
learned after action review it it's
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
better for everyone and this i'm very
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
proud of the fact that we do this we
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
only started doing this about five or
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
six years ago and it's it's excellent
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
customer municipal contact
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
so every year we contact over three
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand customers across the
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
less than one percent of property owners
 
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
do not allow the work to take place
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
so we we track that
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
we also know where those out where those
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
refusals are i don't have a whole lot of
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
them in new hampshire and the law that
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
was changed in september in
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
september 2009 uh which was went from a
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
permission state to a
 
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
opt-out notification state
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
still gives people a chance to talk
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
about it to meet with us they have 45
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
days to talk to us it's a great law
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
but connecticut doesn't have that same
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
situation they've got the most draconian
 
01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:39.590 align:start position:0%
situation they've got the most draconian
and

01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
stuff going on down there they've got
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
about five different ways you can
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
contact a customer that has another
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
the customer can change the
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
specifications and so it's they've run
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
into a lot of problems down there and i
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't have any problem with customers
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
saying this is what i want done to my
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
tree that's how they should be it's
 
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
their tree
 
01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:56.149 align:start position:0%
their tree
but

01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's become a lot more difficult to work
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
down there than it is here and in
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
um this next thing is the mailer this is
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
what we send out to all our customers
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
and i think i brought some today i have
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
a bunch of handouts for you
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
but this is gives people a chance to
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
read it what's going to happen
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
they tear it's they tear a piece off and
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
and they send it back to us and they can
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
say i want a consultation i don't want
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
i thought we might need some levity so i
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
put imagine if trees gave off wi-fi
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
signals we'd be planting so many trees
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
we'd probably save the planet too bad
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
they only produce the oxygen we breathe
 
01:42:36.719 --> 01:42:38.070 align:start position:0%
they only produce the oxygen we breathe
so

01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.350 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:42.870 align:start position:0%
um
yes

01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative callie fitz jackie's fine
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
on the uh oxygen
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
believe it or not i
 
01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:53.270 align:start position:0%
believe it or not i
does

01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
your group in the company or does the
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
company sponsor any
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
replanting programs so that people who
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
have had their
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
trees cut
 
01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:05.109 align:start position:0%
trees cut
um

01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
either know what they can plant so they
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
won't have to go through that again and
 
01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:11.990 align:start position:0%
won't have to go through that again and
maybe

01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
is there any incentive for people to
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
plant again sure
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
i think i might take you to every
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
presentation because you're fitting
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
right in with what i want to talk about
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
so this is this is great now yes we
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a one for one tree
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
replacement program but we'll talk to
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
you about certainly what should be
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
planted there and you'll see from some
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
of our handouts that it's a very
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
important part of what we do
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
so this is hardiness zones this tells
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
you what plants can grow where so
 
01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
obviously we don't have palm trees in
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
florida and we don't have white pine
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
trees and or we don't have palm trees in
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we don't have white pine
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
trees in florida
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
but all four of these hardiness zones
 
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
occur in new hampshire i think it's the
 
01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:49.590 align:start position:0%
occur in new hampshire i think it's the
only

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
might be the only new hampshire or new
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
so that tells you what kind of trees we
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
can deal with representative thomas has
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
a question oh thank you uh ju real quick
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
going back you're talking about
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
my good friend from portsmouth brought
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
up a
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
replanting thing
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
could you
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
just as an example i i i know there was
 
01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
an issue that happened during the
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
merrimack valley reliability project
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
where a particular house hold in my
 
01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:22.229 align:start position:0%
where a particular house hold in my
district

01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
was particularly hit hard and i believe
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
they either helped or they actually
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
replanted trees and vegetation if you
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
are aware of that example could you
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
describe very quickly what the process
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
was involved with that sure
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of that particular
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
instance but in general if we're doing a
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
major line like that if we come to your
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
property and we say we're going to
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
change the way it looks we added these
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
trees out those trees out those shrubs
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
we will come back and talk about a
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
planting plan so that everybody knows
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen what's coming out
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
and then what's going to go back in and
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
those are generally just on these big
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
projects when we're coming to your house
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
to take down a tree
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
if it's one you really don't want to
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
come down even if it's in bad shape
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
and we want it down there might be a
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
negotiation where we could replant the
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
tree for you but as i said we don't have
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
a one for one that would be
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
very difficult to achieve for us as far
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
as the budget goes
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
but that particular situation on a
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
project we always do that if we're going
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
to affect your property we come and talk
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
to you about how that's going to look
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
and what it will look like in the future
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
and and do they do the planning or is
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
that up to the customer to
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
the owner
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
generally we would do the planting or
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
one of our contractors were there have
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
been situations where we just drop off
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
plants because that's what the customer
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
wants they either don't want to deal
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
with us that way they don't want us on
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
their property that way they just want
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
the plants
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
so we'll do that but we also have
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
people who are very good at design and
 
01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:44.790 align:start position:0%
people who are very good at design and
can

01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
from a couple of our different
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
contractors and we have great
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
relationships with our nurseries we deal
 
01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
mostly with milliken which is a
 
01:45:52.709 --> 01:45:52.719 align:start position:0%
wholesale nursery in chichester
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
but most of the trees we try and plant
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire are grown in new
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:59.679 --> 01:46:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
tall growing native species so these
 
01:46:02.159 --> 01:46:03.270 align:start position:0%
tall growing native species so these
trees

01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
trees
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
um all
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
and they're all native trees mostly
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
native trees in our area but our poles
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
are usually 40 to 50 feet tall
 
01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:18.149 align:start position:0%
are usually 40 to 50 feet tall
so

01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.590 --> 01:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
as i said i've been doing this for 40
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
years and i've never seen anything fall
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
up so newton's law is still in effect so
 
01:46:23.679 --> 01:46:24.310 align:start position:0%
up so newton's law is still in effect so
if

01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
the trees are tall and our poles are
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
going to come down and if we're in the
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
way we're going to have an outage so
 
01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:31.030 align:start position:0%
way we're going to have an outage so
uh

01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll talk a little bit further about
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
smaller growing trees here in a minute
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
but acorns um there's always a lot of
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
acorns oaks are a tremendous food source
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
for our
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh squirrels and turkeys and and deer
 
01:46:43.199 --> 01:46:44.550 align:start position:0%
uh squirrels and turkeys and and deer
and

01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.149 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
four of these species here are you'll
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
find in new hampshire the fifth one over
 
01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:51.430 align:start position:0%
find in new hampshire the fifth one over
cup

01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
cup
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh probably only if you go to my house
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.950 --> 01:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
mad horse
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try and do a little
 
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
backyard botany here and i hope you guys
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't mind so
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
for trees that drop their leaves
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
deciduous trees
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
there's only two types of branching
 
01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.070 align:start position:0%
there's only two types of branching
structure

01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
and if that diagram on the left will
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
show you it's either opposite so
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
wherever there's one branch there's one
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
directly opposite
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
or alternate there's one here there's
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
one here there's one here
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
those are the only two ways that
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
so mad horse is an acronym
 
01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:28.390 align:start position:0%
so mad horse is an acronym
maple

01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
maple
 
01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:29.350 align:start position:0%
maple
ash

01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
ash
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
dog dogwood and horse chestnut are the
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
only trees
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
that grow
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
alternate or they grow opposite
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
alternate is everything else elm hickory
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
birch beech apple
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
cherry they're all alternate but mad
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
horses opposite branching trees so what
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
does that help you with well in the
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
winter when we don't have leaves on the
 
01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:48.310 align:start position:0%
winter when we don't have leaves on the
trees

01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
trees
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
it can help us talk to a customer who
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
wants to know what what type of tree it
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
is or help our guys know this tree is
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
going to grow this fast or that fast
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
because it's this type of tree it helps
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
them a little bit
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
and then to the right we have
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
what's known as a compound leaf so that
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
would be your nut trees your hickories
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
and walnuts
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
are the first ones i think of with
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
compound leaves but that whole thing
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
that hole is a is a leaf
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
and those are all leaflets
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
so those are opposite those leaflets but
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's not part of it the leaf itself is
 
01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:19.350 align:start position:0%
that's not part of it the leaf itself is
actually

01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
alternate so
 
01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:21.669 align:start position:0%
alternate so
um

01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
there's two types of
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
all of uh compound leaves there's pin8
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
which i'm showing in this which is like
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
a feather is pinnate and palmate would
 
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
be like your hand and that's how a horse
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
chestnut or a buckeye grows so there's
 
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
five leaves coming out just like your
 
01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:41.910 align:start position:0%
five leaves coming out just like your
hand

01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's also a couple tricks for spruce
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
fur and hemlock
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
so when you think about
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
christmas trees seasonal trees december
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
trees however you want to call it
 
01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:53.350 align:start position:0%
trees however you want to call it
they

01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
tend to be pyramidal
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
and our native white pine is not
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily that shape it's a tall
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
growing tree with a big trunk but the
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
ones that are pyramidal are usually
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
spruce and fur sometimes hemlock
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
so a spruce tree
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
the cones hang down
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
and a fir tree the cones go up
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
so if you're driving by
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
a bunch of trees and you go i wonder
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
what those are they look like spruce and
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
then you see the cones are going up it's
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
a fir tree and
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
it took me about 20 years to figure that
 
01:49:23.679 --> 01:49:24.629 align:start position:0%
it took me about 20 years to figure that
out

01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:49:24.639 --> 01:49:26.149 align:start position:0%
out
but

01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
hemlock the cones are always going to be
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
on the end of the branches as i show on
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
that bottom right
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
so it's just a also another way to tell
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
is if you put your hand open hand on the
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
needles of a spruce tree you're going to
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
feel it it's going to be prickly if you
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
do it on a fir tree it's going to be
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
very soft
 
01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:45.910 align:start position:0%
very soft
so

01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
i put this in just because we've
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
experienced this pandemic for the last
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
couple years and a lot of people did
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
stay home so perhaps the most radical
 
01:49:52.629 --> 01:49:52.639 align:start position:0%
thing we can do is stay at home so we
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
can learn the names of the plants and
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
animals around us so we can begin to
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
know what the tradition is we're part of
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that happened with the
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic is there were more plant sales
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
at nurseries than ever before
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
and it's harder to get plants of any
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
size it's hard to get a lot of landscape
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
material which is a tremendous thing
 
01:50:11.589 --> 01:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
that more people are getting involved in
 
01:50:13.750 --> 01:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
planting and taking care of their stuff
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
but it's harder for us when we go to
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
plant the trees there's just not as much
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
so you've always heard that thing be
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
careful what you wish for or what you
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
i asked one of our admins to find the
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
picture on the internet that looked like
 
01:50:29.199 --> 01:50:29.990 align:start position:0%
picture on the internet that looked like
me

01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.310 align:start position:0%
me
and

01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
so that's hillbilly jim he was a
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
wrestler and he's now i think he's a
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
disc jockey in
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
outlaw country but uh anyhow he's
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
smiling and i'm usually smiling so
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's good
 
01:50:47.830 --> 01:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
um so the two most commonly asked
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions why do oaks hold on to their
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
leaves and why are there so many acorns
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to answer sure so that so the
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
next one is the next slide is why do
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
oaks hold their leaves
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
so they're marcescent and what that
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
means is that they um they hold on to
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
their leaves that's basically all that
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
means they're part of fagaci
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
fugacie which is the beach family oaks
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
are part of the beach family so beach
 
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
so the there's a book that came out last
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
year by dr doug tallamy called the
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
nature of oaks he's a professor down in
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh maryland
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
he's written a lot of plant plant books
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of native books and he's an he's
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
an entomologist by trade but he's really
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
become a
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
hero in the native plant
 
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.270 align:start position:0%
hero in the native plant
movement

01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
movement
 
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
and he says there's three reasons that
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
oaks hold on to their leaves now oaks
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
and beach were also southern plants long
 
01:51:43.679 --> 01:51:45.030 align:start position:0%
and beach were also southern plants long
before

01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
our forefathers ever thought about this
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
country they were
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
but as things have changed they've come
 
01:51:49.119 --> 01:51:50.070 align:start position:0%
but as things have changed they've come
north

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
north
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
so the first thing he says is dinosaur
 
01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:54.310 align:start position:0%
so the first thing he says is dinosaur
browse

01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
browse
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
so as the dinosaurs went to eat the
 
01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.470 align:start position:0%
so as the dinosaurs went to eat the
leaves

01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
leaves
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
the tree as a defense mechanism left its
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
leaves on so they would not be as tasty
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
and if you look at
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
oak trees oftentimes the top is bare but
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
the bottom third has leaves on it and
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
his feeling was that that was the height
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
of which the dinosaurs would do it no
 
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know anybody that was a witness
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
to that so i can't say it was right or
 
01:52:15.679 --> 01:52:16.550 align:start position:0%
to that so i can't say it was right or
wrong

01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
but it makes sense to me
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
the next thing is snow retention so as
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
the snow comes down through the trees if
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
it lands on leaves that are still there
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
when it melts it goes right into the
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
root system so again instead of blowing
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
all over the place it's possibly another
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
defense or or just evolution of the
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
plant to try and make things better for
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
it and then lastly spring nutrients
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
when those leaves do finally come off as
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
the new leaf comes out it pushes the
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
opposition layer to drop the leaf
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
it lands right below the tree
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
and it goes right into for fertilization
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
and nitrogen no it doesn't it lands on
 
01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
my driveway or my
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
lawn i have five giant oak trees on my
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
property and i spend
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
a quarter of the year moving oak leaves
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
oh it drives me crazy
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
oak dry oak drops something every day of
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
the year there's never a year a day it
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
goes by that doesn't drop something
 
01:53:13.679 --> 01:53:15.990 align:start position:0%
goes by that doesn't drop something
so

01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
so those that's the answer for why they
 
01:53:18.629 --> 01:53:18.639 align:start position:0%
hold their leaves according to dr
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
ptolemy and i've been doing this a long
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
time and i think it's probably as close
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
to the truth as any other
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if i'm supposed to
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:34.639 align:start position:0%
there's your microphone rod please
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
is bittersweet an issue for your power
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
lines it's an issue for the poles so
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
oriental beaters bittersweet is the
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
invasive species there is an american
 
01:53:44.070 --> 01:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
bittersweet that doesn't really cause
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
much problem but the oriental is a very
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
fast growing plant grows up the poles
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
gets into the transformer and can cause
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
an outage
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
my guys the tree contractors can only
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
cut it when it's below
 
01:53:56.239 --> 01:53:57.030 align:start position:0%
cut it when it's below
the

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
wire zone if you will
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
so going around every four or five years
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
to do our trimming
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
this thing is a very aggressive grower
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
so it does become a problem
 
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
we do this mid-cycle program every two
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
years to look for it
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
but that's the biggest problem we have
 
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
with vines is oriental bittersweet
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
john okay thank you mr chairman um this
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
while we're on the subject uh i think it
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
was two years ago we had massive numbers
 
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
of white pine cones
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
and stink bugs and do you have any
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
explanation for that
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
so the pine cones i can talk a little
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so
 
01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.390 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so
um

01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's just a cyclical insect
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
like a lot of them are um but i don't
 
01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
know that that was a specific year for
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
them um but where do you live
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
well i'm in new york new orleans so not
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
too far away so i'll have to take a look
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't recall anything like that
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
getting calls about that particular bug
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sure it's not it's just that you
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
know stuff that we don't and this was an
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity oh thank you um
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's kind of you so uh the cones and
 
01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:07.360 align:start position:0%
the and the acorns what we call a mast
 
01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:08.310 align:start position:0%
the and the acorns what we call a mast
ear

01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
ear
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
so a mast year is um
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
if you read these bullets the fruits
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
nuts berries buds and so on produced by
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
trees and bushes are called mast
 
01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:19.679 align:start position:0%
hard mast includes walnuts pecans
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
hickory nuts hard seeds and acorns soft
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
masks includes berries fruits buds and
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
even rose hips but we include pine cones
 
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.070 --> 01:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
so why do we have the mast year every
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
few years um
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
this takes a little bit of a leap but
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
the trees do talk to each other
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
and there's been a lot of books that
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
come out about that in the last few
 
01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:43.669 align:start position:0%
come out about that in the last few
years

01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
finding the mother tree was on the best
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
of the list for a long time by suzanne
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
smart and there's a lot of that stuff in
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
there the secret life of trees all this
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
talks about how the
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
the roots are intertwined and they send
 
01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
signals to each other if there's a bug
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
affecting one or if it's dying it might
 
01:56:00.149 --> 01:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
send out some nutrients and hopefully
 
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:02.719 align:start position:0%
goes out into the community
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
i i believe it i i'm not a scientist i
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
believe it it seems to make sense to me
 
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
because i know the root zone is a very
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
important zone so
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
um why do we have a mast year
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
the trees signal to each other
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
that they need to put out more fruit in
 
01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
any given year the reason being is that
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
mother nature will always adjust
 
01:56:24.159 --> 01:56:25.589 align:start position:0%
mother nature will always adjust
so

01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
if they put out the same amount of
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
acorns every single year
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
then the squirrels the deer the turkey
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
the blue jays which is a big
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
blue jays are a big acorn eater feeder
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
which i didn't know
 
01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.310 align:start position:0%
which i didn't know
um

01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
they will create enough young to eat all
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
the acorns so if it's always a hundred
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
acorns from this tree they'll create
 
01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
enough young to delete those hundred
 
01:56:50.229 --> 01:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
acorns so mother nature says well
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have to just send out a
 
01:56:53.669 --> 01:56:53.679 align:start position:0%
thousand acorns where we used to send
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
out a hundred
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
and that ensures that after everything
 
01:56:58.149 --> 01:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
gets eaten
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
they'll still be enough for regeneration
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
so something will grow up from those
 
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.950 align:start position:0%
so something will grow up from those
seeds

01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
seeds
 
01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.229 align:start position:0%
seeds
additionally

01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
the squirrels maybe say hey
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
mardi gras time so they have more kids
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
and then the next year we don't put out
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
as many acorns so then there's a
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
struggle between the young and the old
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe that gets that population back
 
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
under control
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
so it's a very interesting
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
scientific dynamic i wish i was an
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
expert in it because i think it's a
 
01:57:23.750 --> 01:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
really cool thing but to me that's the
 
01:57:25.350 --> 01:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
answer is that mother nature's saying we
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
need to make sure we can regenerate this
 
01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.470 align:start position:0%
need to make sure we can regenerate this
species

01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
species
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
or we get a squirrel apocalypse like we
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
had right four or five years ago right
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely and that was based on the
 
01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:42.310 align:start position:0%
last year
so

01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:44.870 align:start position:0%
yeah
yep

01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's amazing
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
i always tell you i think that
 
01:57:49.670 --> 01:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
explanation is nuts
 
01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:51.109 align:start position:0%
explanation is nuts
[Laughter]

01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:57:51.119 --> 01:57:52.550 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
jose

01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
jose
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes on the squirrel mageddon i you know
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
i've been in the state for a long time
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
i've never seen anything like that yeah
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
do you recall in your experience so i
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
don't and was it in fact the bad mask
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
here that year it was we had a couple of
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
last years in in the teens and um
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
because i had to explain it out at my
 
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
work about why there were so many cones
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i didn't have as much into info now
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
as i do for you folks but um
 
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
so squirrels are obviously proliferate
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
they're gonna they're gonna keep growing
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
and and um when the climate's right and
 
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
when there's other things right there's
 
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
not as many predators for them they'll
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
just keep continuing to get out of
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
control and mother nature finds a way
 
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
was by vehicles but
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
but they did take care of it
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
so i do have squirrels on my tie today
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
but blue jays blue jays can carry five
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
acorns in their gullet
 
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
i never would have thought that and they
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
tend to plant more oak trees than
 
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
squirrels do
 
01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:56.149 align:start position:0%
squirrels do
so

01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
um getting to the planting the right
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
tree in the right space the average
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
median house sizes increased by 62
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
percent over time
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
so in 1973 the average house in america
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
was 1660 square feet
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
so what that means is it's taking up
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
more of the lot
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
and as it takes up more of the lot
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
there's less chance for large trees to
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
be there
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
now large trees are great i call them
 
01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
noble trees there's always good to see
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
noble trees around it's new england
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
built on having large trees and our
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
foliage industry is usually from large
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
trees but
 
01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
our trees can be reliable year after
 
01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
year with fall color
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to power lines and
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
house size
 
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
smaller trees are better for us near the
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
power lines
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
so i included a thing that i found to be
 
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
the best thing i've ever read on
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
planting trees so this i won't go over
 
01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:55.669 align:start position:0%
planting trees so this i won't go over
but

01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
it's something you can look at if you're
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
ever going to plant the tree
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
one thing that i've been very proud of
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
after working here a long time and i've
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
been arguing as an arborist
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
that we needed to do something on
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
planting the right tree in the right
 
02:00:12.159 --> 02:00:13.750 align:start position:0%
planting the right tree in the right
place

02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
replanting trees when we can
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
looking at situations where if we're
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
going to trim these trees
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
every year wouldn't it be better if we
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
didn't have those trees there we had
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
trees that only grew up so tall and you
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
can't make it all be like a lego set
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
where you have this on one side and that
 
02:00:30.629 --> 02:00:30.639 align:start position:0%
on the other but you can try and work
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
with it and when you take a tree down
 
02:00:34.070 --> 02:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's too big maybe suggest putting a
 
02:00:36.070 --> 02:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
smaller tree in so
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
i was able to build a
 
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
two pole two sections
 
02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:43.109 align:start position:0%
two pole two sections
um

02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
utility arboretum over at the urban
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
forestry center in portsmouth
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
after they had a big windstorm about
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
2012 i think it was and they lost all
 
02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
their spruce trees i was on the
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
community forest advisory council for
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
the state and i said what do we should
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
we do here
 
02:00:59.189 --> 02:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
when we try utility arboretum so we put
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
two side two poles in with one line
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
dead planted trees that would grow near
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
the wires so instead of going on the
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
internet and looking at this little tree
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
and saying i want that you actually get
 
02:01:11.109 --> 02:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
to go there 52 weeks a year if you want
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
and see how that tree grows and what it
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
looks like near the wires
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
so it was only 10 trees so we had a as
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know we used to be public service
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and part of northeast
 
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
utilities we combined with and star
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
became eversource my boss at the time
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
vera admore sachi didn't know much about
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
trees but she was the best boss i ever
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
had she knew what she knew and she knew
 
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
it didn't what she didn't know and she
 
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
she gave us the the chance to show her
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
what we did what she didn't know and and
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
try and learn and try and help us and
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
she was just fantastic a very humane
 
02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:40.950 align:start position:0%
she was just fantastic a very humane
person

02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
and we had a all hands meeting at the
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
portsmouth urban forestry center
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i was supervisor in new hampshire at
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
that time and she said i love this i
 
02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
want you to do it in connecticut
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and i said well
 
02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
i only cover new hampshire i don't see
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
how i'm going to get that done she said
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
you'll figure it out
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
and to her credit um
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
she then gave me massachusetts to deal
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
with for for five years and i got one
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
built down at umass
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
and we built one at hooksett two years
 
02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:07.830 align:start position:0%
and we built one at hooksett two years
ago

02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh which representative plett came and
 
02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
went on a tour with us last year
 
02:02:12.239 --> 02:02:13.430 align:start position:0%
went on a tour with us last year
um

02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
but what it is is
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
we have four of them now three of them
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
are de-energized lines so we can have
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
safety days there we can have training
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
days there people can bring their bucket
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
trucks in and teach guys how to work
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
near the wires without having a problem
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
um the one in hooksett is a live line
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
but that's where my office is and i
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
decided i just i want to take advantage
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
of being here every day and we planted
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
we got over 60 trees there so what we've
 
02:02:38.159 --> 02:02:38.950 align:start position:0%
we got over 60 trees there so what we've
done

02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
is try and put species that only grow
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
30 feet tall
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
as i said our polls are 40 to 50 feet
 
02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
tall and
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
we've also brought some species up from
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
the mid-atlantic states
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
to see if there is a climate change
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
issue if there isn't i don't know but
 
02:02:56.070 --> 02:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
we'll try them here and see how they do
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
we put something called a crepe myrtle
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
which people have maybe seen if they've
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
gone down south
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
at the umass one it grows up every year
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
it dies every winter goes down comes
 
02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:06.639 align:start position:0%
back the next spring goes up we never
 
02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
thought it would do that
 
02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:08.950 align:start position:0%
thought it would do that
so

02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
the research has been good there we have
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
something called a
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
chinese fringe tree
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
at our hooksett site and there is a
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
there's a um
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
native fringe tree which some people
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
call old man's beard it's got hanging
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
white flowers in the spring it's more of
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
a shrub but the chinese fringe tree is
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be zone six and that's not
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in new hampshire but it's
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
here and it's doing all right so
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
that type of thing it doesn't cost the
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
company really anything to try and do
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
this we're working with our contractors
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
they donated a lot of the time and the
 
02:03:38.159 --> 02:03:39.510 align:start position:0%
they donated a lot of the time and the
effort

02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
effort
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the plants
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
to have this nice space so we'd love to
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
have you folks come down and do a tour
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to see it at some point
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's right down in hooksett on legends
 
02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
drive and i'll be glad to host that
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
and show you what we've done
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
but as we continue to do this we
 
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
research and see if there's other plants
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
that will grow up in in new hampshire
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
which gives us a chance to get away from
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
having an ash species go away or an elm
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
species go away have i gone over time
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
well we're getting uh fairly close to
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
the end of our time
 
02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:11.510 align:start position:0%
the end of our time
rod

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
rod
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
another question for you concerning
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
choosing these different trees that
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with one of them you
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned was a chinese fringe tree
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
is that's not native it's not native and
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
are are there concerns about something
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
like that sure there's always an
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
invasive well it's not an invasive but
 
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's not native so the difference is
 
02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:34.149 align:start position:0%
it's not native so the difference is
um

02:04:34.149 --> 02:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
some plants are invasive that are not
 
02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:37.830 align:start position:0%
some plants are invasive that are not
natives

02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
natives
 
02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:39.990 align:start position:0%
natives
however

02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
i've got a post here 30 under 30 33
 
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
zones with 30 feet tall i sent it out to
 
02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
1200 garden centers and nurseries
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
it has japanese maple on it japanese
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
maple is one of the most highly planted
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
trees in the united states it's a very
 
02:04:53.350 --> 02:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
nice ornamental little tree red leaves
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
green leaves
 
02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
lots of people have it my feeling was if
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
i tell
 
02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:00.310 align:start position:0%
i tell
the

02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
landscapers and nursery industry that we
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't want you selling that anymore it's
 
02:05:06.149 --> 02:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
really going to impact them economically
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
and so there are some native trees that
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
are on our utility arboretum there's
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
some non-native trees but there's
 
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
nothing that really hasn't been in the
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
trade for for decades we're not bringing
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
anything new when they say oh we've
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
never tried this before let's bring it
 
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
to the united states we're not doing
 
02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:20.550 align:start position:0%
to the united states we're not doing
that

02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:21.750 align:start position:0%
that
so

02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
um and i'll zip through this so we have
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
four arboretum locations
 
02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:26.149 align:start position:0%
four arboretum locations
uh

02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%

the poster i sent out and you folks have
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
a copy today
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
just shows you the trees that will
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
grow that we suggested plant near the
 
02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:43.990 align:start position:0%
grow that we suggested plant near the
wires

02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%

and that's great if you're looking at
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
landscape plants if you want to learn
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
what kind of trees you have near your
 
02:05:56.159 --> 02:05:57.270 align:start position:0%
what kind of trees you have near your
property

02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%

02:05:59.189 --> 02:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
the field guide from audubon society is
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
a better better option
 
02:06:02.470 --> 02:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
i put this in i hope you don't think
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
it's pandering to the audience but
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
dudley orr the first attorney general of
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire had this quote
 
02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i thought it was really an excellent
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
quote as you get older you don't sleep
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
as much
 
02:06:15.510 --> 02:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
while i lie awake i think about what
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
good things i can do for people so one
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
of the things i think about is how can i
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
get people to plant the right tree in
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
the right place
 
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
and that's something we've really worked
 
02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:24.390 align:start position:0%
and that's something we've really worked
on

02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i'll finish with a much younger me
