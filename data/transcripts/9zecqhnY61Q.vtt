within the time frame there and I

imagine notice soon will come about as
 
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
to when the full finance committee will
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
well as those of Divisions one and
 
00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
two we don't have to worry about blurbs
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
today uh we'll worry about that when uh
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
we meet as a full finance committee but
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
certainly keep in mind that those will
 
00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
be needed so if any suit your fancy to
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%

00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
resident is roughly
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
$4,500 the current amount doesn't quite
 
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
get us there and 115 doesn't pay all the
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
bills but it definitely uh eases some of
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
the burden because from the low income
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
we relying on social security and
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
whatever income may exist uh
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
so it helps considerably and a raise
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
would be most
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
appreciated and that's all I
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative for taking
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
the time on your bill we appreciate that
 
00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:43.629 align:start position:0%
the time on your bill we appreciate that
representative

00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
tersi thank you I don't know if this is
 
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
a question for the chair or the sponsor
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
but I'm curious if we have any analysis
 
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:52.759 align:start position:0%
of what this type of home is now going
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
to be receiving under our the new budget
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
that was passed and signed into law that
 
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.749 align:start position:0%
that was passed and signed into law that
raise

00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
raise
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
rates thank you for that and I'm glad
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
you brought that out in the House Bill 2
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
version that we passed section 79 colon
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
239 we set various rates increasing them
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that a
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
breakdown analysis hasn't been fully
 
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.749 align:start position:0%
breakdown analysis hasn't been fully
done

00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
however a home such as representative
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
Horgan is talking about would receive
 
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.110 align:start position:0%
Horgan is talking about would receive
approximately

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
$80 as opposed to the 115 he's asking
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
for but certainly different from the 56
 
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.990 align:start position:0%
for but certainly different from the 56
he's

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
he's
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
getting uh at this point I'm going to
 
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
ask Mr Ripple for the technicalities on
 
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
what I've said and to fill in any
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
loopholes there that I may have missed
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
sure yes so the Section House Bill 2
 
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
that you referenced didn't specify a
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
rate but it did provide a little over
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
$700,000 in fiscal 24 and a little over
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
1.4 million in fiscal 25 uh for the
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of increasing rates to assisted
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
living facilities I think in the trailer
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
bill that would apply to all assisted
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
living facilities rather than only the
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
ones specified by this bill and I don't
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
know what daily rate it would bring them
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
to I think it would be somewhat less
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
than $80 because um when I look at the
 
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet provided by Jim Monahan
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
during the budget session he was asking
 
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
for 2.5 million per year to bring rates
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
to $80 and this provides 1.5 4 million
 
00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
per year when fully implemented so I
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
would need to look to the department to
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:43.959 align:start position:0%
provide okay anything further then at
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
this point I would look for a motion on
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
527 when the members are
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
ready representative f um I make a
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
motion to it tell this and I could speak
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
to my motion okay a motion's been made
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
to itl is there a second representative
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
hle for a second representative
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
Earth so as I understand the process
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
that's ongoing and I think we're going
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
to hear more about
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
this um later this month in the fiscal
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
committee the uh rate structure that has
 
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
has been developed by HHS and I don't
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
he's not here is
 
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
he um is intended to balance the rates
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
across not just across all these
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
assisted facilities but across all the
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates um in general and just
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
bumping up one particular the rate for
 
00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:40.269 align:start position:0%
bumping up one particular the rate for
one

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
particular class of workers who same
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
class Works in other environments but
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
not adjusting them in those other
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
environments um wouldn't be appropriate
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
so I think you'll find that the rates
 
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
are as being said here would be would
 
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
increase the rates as described and
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
furthermore maintain the consistency
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
across all the different rate structures
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the Medicaid uh program that we um I
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
think we allocated $134 million if I'm
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
not mistaken to um adjust the med
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
medicate adjust Medicaid rates pretty
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%

this size um a re-evaluation at the
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
seven-year Mark I think is where we
 
00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
settled in the budget is is a reasonable
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
um is a reasonable decision and I can't
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
that thank you uh just to add that this
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
uh bill is not fully incorporated into

the budget but it is as you say
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
263 all right I would imagine the
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
discussion would be very similar to the
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
previous motion is my guess so when the
 
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:48.260 align:start position:0%
clerk is ready to call the
 
00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.590 align:start position:0%

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
role I believe it was whole and Earth on
 
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.269 align:start position:0%
role I believe it was whole and Earth on
the

00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
motion it was actually
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
Earth that made the motion and hole that
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
seconded all right thank you trying to
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
here Madam
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
chair yes representative pole if I may
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
before we call the role um just
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
something to note our federal government
 
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
is now
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
$100,000 in debt per person and we're
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
counting on them to fund a portion of
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
this program and the current debt is not
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
sustainable so when we start making
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
promises to our citizens based on
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
commitments from the federal government
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't look like they're going
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
careful okay thank you on the motion of

263 and again all of these
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations go to the full finance
 
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
committee uh for further discussion and
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation lastly and we're breezing
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
right through so this has been great
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
this is very good uh lastly Senate Bill
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
239 and that is an act relative to the
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
use of harm reduction services to treat
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol and other substance
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
misuse uh we recently had a work session
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
on that earlier um in the year and also
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
uh just recently well actually it was in
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
June so mid year I know we have
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro were you
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
speaking at this point on the
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
bill okay at this point I'll represent
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you madam chair um this is
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
a bill um that came through Health and
 
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee um that
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
incorporates um harm reduction into the
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
current statutes um there was a great
 
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
deal of support for it um in our
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
committee and I think in general but
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
there have been contentious questions
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
about how to define harm reduction
 
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
because um some people have been
 
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.509 align:start position:0%
because um some people have been
concerned

00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:58.470 align:start position:0%
concerned
about

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
other things being added in the future
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't even know about or I think
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
specifically about safe injection sites
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
which there is not a consensus um in New
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about including so I think
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
that is where the sticking point in this
 
00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:14.750 align:start position:0%
that is where the sticking point in this
bill

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
comes um I assumed that we were going to
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
have a continued session today which is
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
why I came um but other people who were
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
involved in that are not here um I'm
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
probably not the best person to talk
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
about this because
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm not that picky about the
 
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
definition that we use I would have
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
supported this bill with the original
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
definition or any of the other
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
definitions that have been mentioned um
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
so I would support an or to pass on this
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for that any further
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
followup representative
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
walner thank you so the Health and Human
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
Services committee passed this bill and
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
it came came to
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
finance presumably to look at the
 
00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:03.799 align:start position:0%
financial ramifications of it but the
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services committee
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
actually felt the bill was in good shape
 
00:29:10.509 --> 00:29:10.519 align:start position:0%
and ready to come to the
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
passed I really should have looked to
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
see what the vote was in our committee
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
um so if somebody could do that that
 
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
would be helpful um but I it wouldn't be
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
here if we didn't pass it and I I think
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
there was fairly broad consensus not
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
complete consensus but fairly broad
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
consensus that the bill was in good
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
shape um maybe representative kofalt
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
could speak further I have
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
it thank you for that and also uh
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
looking at the May 12th 2023 House
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
calendar uh that it looks like the bill
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
came out of committee without
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation representative Co
 
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
fault thank you so I sit on Health and
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
the I'll say I believe that there was um
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
consensus as to the need for um some
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
kind of harm reduction
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
um harm reduction legislation and it's
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
something that we need to look at the
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
concern that some of us on the committee
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
had had to do with the definition of
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
harm reduction um I was concerned about
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
that another Committee Member and I drew
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
up a flooor Amendment which passed which
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
further clarified the definition of harm
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
reduction um and that's we passed the
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment as a house and then we
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
passed the the bill with the floor
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment um having said that I have
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
spoken to several members of the
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee who have subsequently Express
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
concern who who like myself voted for
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
the bill at that time have have have
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
subsequently um raised concerns relative
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
to the definition of harm reduction and
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
what it might incompass and how that is
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
being used in other states in particular
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
and around the world um
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
so you know our I I I guess I'll speak
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
for myself in saying that I think that
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses some very important
 
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:24.519 align:start position:0%
concerns having said that um I think
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
that considerable further discussion is
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
required to narrow and clarify that
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction because
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
right now um despite our efforts to to
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
Define it more clearly it seems like it
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
is um still not clearly defined um as as
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
be representative Hull thank you madam
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
chair having in my past worked at a drug
 
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
and alcohol rehab for two years this is
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
a real issue and I fully understand it
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure the legisl that we're
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
looking at right now actually will
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
address some of the core issues um that
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed and terms like harm
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
reduction that representative Cal just
 
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned are vague um there are some
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
other things that likewise would be
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
problematic if the bill went forward as
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
is there are things that I think are val
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
valuable like some of the test strips
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
and other things so maybe it's worth
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
holding on and studying this I don't
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
know if that is an
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
option that would be an inm study
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
motion I would be willing to make that
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
motion second okay a motion made for
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
inim study on Senate Bill 239 with a
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
second by representative
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
motion representative tarki I don't
 
00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:54.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a um discussion on the
 
00:32:56.629 --> 00:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
motion I know that we had just pulled up
 
00:32:59.629 --> 00:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
the doc it do we we know it passed the
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
house um the first committee when it
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
came through the house and to then bring
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
it to finance I'm just curious what the
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
vote was on that day I know it was close
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
but I'm
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
just I don't know if representative
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
kofalt has it that or I could look it up
 
00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.549 align:start position:0%
kofalt has it that or I could look it up
too

00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:15.559 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
sorry Whoever has it the quickest sure
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
so the first amendment was adoption of
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
the committee Amendment at 2491 1227
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
there was a subsequent floor Amendment
 
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.950 align:start position:0%
there was a subsequent floor Amendment
at

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.629 align:start position:0%
at
3598

00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
3598
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
um but as representative Cal said some
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
others have since looked at this and
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
realized there's more work to be done
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
sorry can you just clarify what was the
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended vote on the
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
house floor uh that wasn't a roll call
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
that was a Voice vote I just oh it was
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
Voice vote thank you that answers my
 
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
question roll calls were only on the
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
adoption of I appreciate that thank
 
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
you okay representative Shapiro thank
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
you madam speaker
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
um as I said before or I was not someone
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
who was so particular about the
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
definition and the reason for that is
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
because I feel that there would be many
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
other guard rails along the way before
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
any other activities were actually
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
legitimized and implemented um so for
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
example safe injection sites which some
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
states use and um there seems to
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
be quite a bit of opposition to in New
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think in order for something
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
like that to be imple mented there would
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
have to be funding there would have to
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
be um various kinds of permissions both
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
locally and and and by the state so I
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
think um with the definition of harm
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
reduction as is there are many guard
 
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.750 align:start position:0%
reduction as is there are many guard
rails

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
rails
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
for putting into effect or not putting
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
into effect um
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
various um harm reduction activities so
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
pass thank you representative
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
H as I mentioned before having worked in
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
this field a little bit um I'm not sure
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with the mental health issues
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
that lead people to um start abusing
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
drugs and or alcohol and or other
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
substances um is going to be addressed
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
sites

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
sites
 
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.109 align:start position:0%
sites
representative

00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
walner well I find myself in the same
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
place I am often on this committee is
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
that it feels
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
like these new concerns about this piece
 
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
of legislation all deal with policy and
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
the policy committee has done its work
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
and has sent it to us and we've really
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
we have not looked at the finances of it
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
I mean that's not the reason we are
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to continue studying it we're
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
studying it because of policy reasons
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
and um I feel like that the uh Health
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
and Human Services committee did its
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
work they passed us to us on the policy
 
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
they wanted us to look at the finances
 
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
which again we're digging into the
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
policy and not into the finances so for
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
that reason I'm going to vote against
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
the interim
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
study or the yeah whatever whatever it
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
is we do in the off
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
year study is the motion right uh which
 
00:36:31.309 --> 00:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
it brings up a point it's my
 
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
understanding from the rules unlike a
 
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:36.280 align:start position:0%
retained motion the inim study motion
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
goes to the Full House the retained
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
Motion in year one does not year two uh
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
interim study does any further
