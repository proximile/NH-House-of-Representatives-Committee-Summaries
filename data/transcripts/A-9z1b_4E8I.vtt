00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
elaborate all that effort I poured into
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%

hoping that there was hope there is hope
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
is There's Hope but but is there hope
 
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
that you're going to run is always do
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
you need $2 for the
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
fee beautiful day outside you're wasting
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of time
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
on well since you said that with a smile
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
um representative Merchant possible for
 
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
you it it's possible I have
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
a appreciation for Friday afternoons to
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
not tie them up um think we're getting
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
into the summer months I would like to
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
keep them as free as possible so I would
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
lean more towards very free in July and
 
00:10:58.839 --> 00:10:59.910 align:start position:0%
lean more towards very free in July and
August

00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
August
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and even end the all be much
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
appreciated okay representative Senator
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
rosenal told me that would not work for
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
her um honestly for myself this is my
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
day off and I can rationalize being here
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
and leaving at noon but being here and
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
leaving it free is problematic for
 
00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:22.030 align:start position:0%
leaving it free is problematic for
me

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
um all right we'll just we'll percolate
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
on this representative Edwards so so so
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
obious thank you Mr chair so obviously
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of moving this to the uh
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh I have a a an ongoing
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
conflict between the governor's
 
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
Commission on alcohol and drug misuse
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
and this and they're both very important
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
I think they're both very synergistic
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
and and I would love to be able to do
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
both um and I'm just not doing either
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
very well because of the conflict I it's
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
also my understanding I didn't speak for
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
the Department for a second that the
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
that the commiss commissioner May
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
benefit from having this move to the
 
00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:04.839 align:start position:0%
afternoon as well do you do you want to
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
nod or shake your
 
00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:18.949 align:start position:0%
nod or shake your
head

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
oh all right and we we can serve
 
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
cocktails too
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
uh you're making it easier for me you
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
know Des Merchant thank you Mr chair um
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
is it always have to be in the fourth
 
00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:35.550 align:start position:0%
is it always have to be in the fourth
Friday

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't have to be on the fourth
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
so representative Edwards with moving it
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
to a different Friday of the month yes
 
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
sure it would that would do it for me
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
representative Weber oh I'm I'm so sorry
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
to answer just to finish the answer of
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
the question Friday's mornings are
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
typically fiscal committee so would
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
probably uh run into yet a different
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
conflict with my fiscal committee
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
obligations but does that mean Friday
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
mornings but C every single Friday
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
morning no it's like every other I don't
 
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
know the we moved to the fourth to avoid
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal okay we moving to the second
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
avoid fiscal I don't know because I'm
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
not on fiscal probably I can verify that
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay um let's Mr chair yes and also in
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
regards to the commissioner whether that
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
would help her with her conflicts as
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
well going to the second Friday of the
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
month I
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
fair representative Weber before we
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
spend too much time on this negotiation
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
which could be done by email right um
 
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to point out that if we're not
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
here in July and August that leaves us
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
SE September and October before we are
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
reorganized and so all bets may be off
 
00:14:06.269 --> 00:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
because everything may be moving to
 
00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:08.550 align:start position:0%
because everything may be moving to
different

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
times stay tuned thank
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
you DHHS Commissioners update
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
Weaver good morning
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
I did give a handout to uh each of you
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
it's the multicolored
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
multi-paged uh handout that says Mission
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
zero uh mobilizing Collective action so
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
I I thought it would be appropriate to
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
uh have my update this morning really be
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
on what's going on with Mission zero we
 
00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:52.519 align:start position:0%
did have a court deadline of May 17th uh
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
which was last Friday um
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
to uh for certain things to be reached
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
by them so I thought i' give would the
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
commission hold for a minute yes
 
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.829 align:start position:0%
commission hold for a minute yes
representative

00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
Weber oh sure the one that has lots of
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
colors uh oh how about this
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
one I I did put one
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
over I I put it over there I thought
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
there no not at all it's always good to
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
have not at all thank
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
you you I'm sorry no no worries I
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
thought you usually do sit over there so
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
when your stuff was over there I was
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
confused so I thought um just to give a
 
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
little bit of a of an overview um back
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh about a year ago early 23 um the
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
hospital Association filed an injunction
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
against the department for seizing its
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
property in the emergency departments um
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
and through the court um injunction it
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
was determined that um the department
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
had one year to come into compliance
 
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
with moving patients within 6 hours out
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
of the Ed um happening right around the
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
same time uh the department Was
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
preparing to launch what we call Mission
 
00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
zero which is what you have in front of
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
you and the goal of mission zero really
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
is about um we call it zero because we
 
00:16:18.189 --> 00:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
want our weight list to be zero um so
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
we're not the only state in the country
 
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
obviously facing these challenges but it
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
was our call to Collective action so we
 
00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
have um actually for the last ye you
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
know I guess 13 14 months maybe more um
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
than working collaboratively with our
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
partners so the basic premise is it of U
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
reducing the Ed boarding is being able
 
00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
to look at all points in the system so
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
if it's the point of entry if it's the
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
point of exit if it's the point of
 
00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
transfer where can we be making um
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
changes and where can be be making a
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
difference so I just want to be clear so
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
the difference between the two was the
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
injunction was for the 6 hours and then
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
Ed boarding Mission Zer was to eliminate
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
Ed boarding um they obviously do connect
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
and relate to one another if you um flip
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
to the center you'll see there's two
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
pages of blue uh chart this is what is
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
detailing all of our progress in the
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
last year so for the last year I've had
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
to report to the judge on a regular
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
basis what we've been doing in the
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
department what difference we making so
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to to come to you today and
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
share that we actually are making an
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
impact and we actually are having a
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
difference so despite not hitting the um
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
6h hour mark uh on the on the dot we I
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
can tell you that we have reduced by 50%
 
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
uh the number of days of people sitting
 
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
in EDS so that's pretty significant when
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
we look at where we were where there was
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
times we would have about upwards of 50
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
people on a weight list for long
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
extended periods of time we now see our
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
weight list changing and fluctuating so
 
00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
for example um on Monday every Monday
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
every day I look at the weight list but
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
on Monday it was 31 and you know you
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
sort of gasp it like 31 it was 7 on
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
Friday what happened this weekend um and
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
then as of yesterday it was back down to
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
seven sitting in Ed so we break down our
 
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
weight list in terms of actually sitting
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
in the Ed and then there's some other
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
like um conditional discharge um and
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
some Correctional settings but we're
 
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
really honing in on on that Ed so
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
through our Partnerships I'll tell you
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's been a year of partnership um and
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
collaboration with um our
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
Nami our National Alliance for mentally
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
ill uh our community mental health
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
centers and the hospital Association um
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
as well as um our emergency department
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
room staff and docs so it's it's really
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
bringing together all of the people that
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
impact the system to be able to make a
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
difference and I just want to walk you
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
through quickly I'm not going to read
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
all of these for you but I do want to
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple of them um if you
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
look at on the first blue page year if
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
you go three down it says care traffic
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
control this was uh an effort that took
 
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
quite a while to stand up in terms of
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and the positions and
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
what have you but basically 247 uh 247
 
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
we have staff at New Hampshire hospital
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
ready to receive these referrals ready
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
to receive the ieas um so what H has
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
happened is we now have a system where
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
every day there's a huddle with the Eds
 
00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
to look at who's in the queue what the
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
available resources are and then making
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
sure that people get to where they need
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
to be so there's active um engagement
 
00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:35.799 align:start position:0%
and active movement so that's why you
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
can see a weight list maybe in the
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
morning maybe rather High by the end of
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
the day we're able to look at all of our
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility beds and
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
be make sure that they're getting
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
utilized which was part of the problem
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
before is that we would have a bunch of
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
beds not not just New Hampshire hospital
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
we have those beds but elsewhere and
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
they weren't being utilized so now we
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
have full knowledge full visibility from
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
all of our EDS saying okay this is the
 
00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
total number of beds this is the total
 
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
need for today and then making that work
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty significant um the
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
hospital Association has partnered with
 
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
us on doing some training so we're
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
everybody that touches it we've they've
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
done about four trainings already
 
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:14.919 align:start position:0%
several hundred people at at some of
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
them and they'll continue to do them so
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
that people understand how what that
 
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
system is and how to use it so we're
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
rather proud of that um just speaking
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
about beds for a a little bit we had the
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
infamous unit enf unit that took forever
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
to come online at New Hampshire hospital
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
due to construction challenges or curses
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
as I like to say um and we finally got a
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
eunit up which was bringing an
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
additional 12 beds back online at the
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
beginning of May so we went from 158
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
capacity to 170 and we have 14 beds left
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
to get online by the end of this
 
00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:53.559 align:start position:0%
calendar year um so our New Hampshire
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
hospital has worked uh very creatively
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
to for Staffing um to be able to staff
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
that and that's what they'll continue to
 
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
do is that Focus for the remaining 14 um
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
as of yesterday I believe all parties
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
have agreed to and including the courts
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
to give the department an extension
 
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
until December 31st of this calendar
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
year to come closer or to to meet that
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
6-h hour deadline um I know we're going
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
to come closer I'm hoping to hit that uh
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
six hours by the end of this year we are
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
working on dashboards with all of our
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
partners to be able to put up so
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
everybody has the same data about what's
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
what's happening with our uh system and
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
who's in it and what the needs are there
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
is a lot of work going on around what a
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
the 6 hours itself you know why the 6
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
hours why is it not 12 hours why is it
 
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
18 hours and so there's there's a lot a
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
lot of hands in the pot working on that
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
um so yesterday's weight list was seven
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
uh and the kids was a little bit higher
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
Mission zero does not cover the kids as
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
of today it is our goal it is our
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
mission to be able to expand at some
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
point for the kids but the kids numbers
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
can fluctuate and most of the kids are
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
not iea so there's a little bit of a
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
difference there um if you flip to the
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
second page of the of the um diagram
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
here in terms of you'll see there's two
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
things I just want to highlight which is
 
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
sort of that that exit door of leaving
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
we uh have had
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
traditionally disposition issues or
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
challenges if you will with folks that
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't need Hospital level of care and
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
they're still residing within the
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
hospital because there isn't enough uh
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
resources of places for them to go
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
afterwards so we actually have uh two
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
two five bed programs that will be at
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
full occupancy by the end of June um and
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
then two additional five bed Properties
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
by the end of July uh Riverbend is work
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh working with us we just brought on 12
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
new specialty residential beds um and we
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
also have our path uh program as well
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
that was transitioned over to NFI so
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
that that I highlight that that because
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
that's bringing forth um more resources
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
for that um exiting if you will and then
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
I think one of things that we're really
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
happy about is our landlord incentive
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
program which uh we actually uh have
 
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
patients unfortunately that have been in
 
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
the hospital for years right and it's
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
really hard to leave so really working
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
with landlords in terms of being able to
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
provide uh housing um but housing that
 
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
comes with support so if there's any um
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
consequences from any of
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
former patients living that they would
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
have resources available to maybe
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
address what some of those consequences
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
would be or even uh the help to be able
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
to have folks successfully stay where
 
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
they land so it it is our goal to have
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
25 patients moved in by the end of this
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
year um and I know some have already
 
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.430 align:start position:0%
year um and I know some have already
moved

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
moved
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
in I'll stop there because it looks like
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
you might have a question um one
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
facility I don't see mentioned here is
 
00:23:59.470 --> 00:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital how does that figure
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
not the new DCF building but the
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
existing Hamet hospital so Mission zero
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to kids right now Mission
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
zero is adult Focus based on um Ed
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
boarding for adults yeah representative
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you very much and thank you
 
00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:18.919 align:start position:0%
for that report um could you I have a
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
couple of just very specific questions
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh you said there were more kids than
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
seven as of yesterday waiting and I
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
understand that the the uh order doesn't
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
apply to them but how many were there
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh as of yesterday there were
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
10 on Monday there were
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
three okay and and as a followup if I
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
may um followup could you tell me about
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
the actual length of stays for adults in
 
00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:48.039 align:start position:0%
EDS at the moment I know it's been
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
reduced but what having having heard
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
anecdotally of somebody who was there
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
for a week in December I just love to
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
know what the average day is now I I
 
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't rattle that off for you the top
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
of my head the dashboards that I I was
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
sharing that were about to share
 
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
publicly would have that and I can
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
follow up with you I just don't have
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
that in terms of because there's a lot
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
of beds so to average that out right I I
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
realize that it's a very moving Target
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you thank you Mr chair um
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate uh the work that's gone
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
into this commissioner um as I'm looking
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
at it I'm trying to imagine
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
the um sort of the the programmatic
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
management challenges and the financial
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
um estimation challenges associated with
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
having a program that sort of um you've
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
got a probably a central person or or
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
small staff that are worried about it
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
but the the ability to execute the
 
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
program is probably spread throughout
 
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
many components of the department many
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
other entities independent entities
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and so so the
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
program management and control aspect
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
seems inherently
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
challenging uh and the
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
financial uh estimation would therefore
 
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
be also hard to U predict I'm I I I I'm
 
00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
curious how when this comes in to our
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
budget next year how we're going to know
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
how much money you need to support this
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
program because the the money will line
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
be lined up all over departments
 
00:26:30.919 --> 00:26:34.230 align:start position:0%
be lined up all over departments
everywhere

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
right yes so so so we've already spent
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
the money to stand up the position that
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
are specific to care traffic control
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
which is really like the main driver of
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
overseeing the system for the department
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
but that's that is in conjunction with
 
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.389 align:start position:0%
but that's that is in conjunction with
other

00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
partners so that is all of the Eds are
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
working with us I I already have the
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
position stood up I I got I was able to
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
get that funding and those positions to
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
do that so that would be included in the
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
next year's budget for that not I'm not
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily looking to see additional
 
00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
funding I think the Hope here is that we
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
we are able to discharge folks so that
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
we can keep people getting the needs of
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
services right so we have our Revenue
 
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
offsetting our expenses and then folks
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
being able to get to where they need so
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
in terms and I just want to say in terms
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
of program oversight one of the things
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
that didn't mention in here is we have a
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
steering committee and that steering
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee is the executive level
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
including myself of Nai the hospital
 
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
Association myself and Community Mental
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
Health Centers um and hospitals Who
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
oversee uh monthly what's happening with
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
all of these initiatives and where are
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
the numbers so there's a level of
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
accountability and oversight that isn't
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
just the Departments alone that would
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
continue so the parties to the suit are
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
at the table talking all the time or
 
00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.110 align:start position:0%
at the table talking all the time or
regular

00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
regular
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
yeah we sit next to each other sometimes
 
00:28:00.919 --> 00:28:04.190 align:start position:0%
yeah we sit next to each other sometimes
too

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
yes so so I I I guess maybe I wasn't as
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
clear on the point I'm trying to make is
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
is I'm looking at this circle of six
 
00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:15.559 align:start position:0%
initiatives each of these initiatives
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
has money associated with them on terms
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
of the current level and what the needed
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
required level is in the future so each
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
of these six are probably going to
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
percolate up into the through the budget
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
process in separate silos and and so I'm
 
00:28:35.389 --> 00:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
just curious how we're going to see the
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
total cost of the total program so that
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
we can support a total program and not
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
just end up with six siloed questions
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
sure I mean the good news is that the
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
majority of these programs are federally
 
00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
funded there's Federal money for that
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
and using very little general fund for
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
that other than our
 
00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.870 align:start position:0%
that other than our
staffing

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
staffing
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
so I I'm I'm not I'm not necessarily
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
connecting with what what you're I I'll
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it I'll I'll try to talk to
 
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.149 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it I'll I'll try to talk to
Nathan

00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
Nathan
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else for the commissioner on
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
this subject representative
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you thank you for this
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
report very it's very helpful and for
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
one who had seen so many people staying
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
in the emergency room overnight I'm very
 
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
happy that the number is seven right now
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
my question is is the Huddle that you
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
referenced done at each hospital or is
 
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
it done
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
centrally um at your department and also
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
you mentioned resources does that impact
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
where some of these folks can go if they
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
have resources or
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
not so I have a question on your second
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
question but I'll answer your first
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
question first um the Huddle is
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
comprised of all of the hospitals that
 
00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
have designated receiving facility beds
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
um there's quite a few in addition
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
addition to New Hampshire hospital that
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
are out there so that those huddles are
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
with those beds where we would Place
 
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
involuntary patients so it's receiving
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
people in a zoom type call that looks at
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
each day basically yeah so we're
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
actually have docs and and nurses on the
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
on the call uh AP uh psychiatric nurses
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
as well on the call with our staff yes
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
and then the second question was
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
resources um you mentioned resources
 
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
does that impact where some of these
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
go resources can be more specific in
 
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
terms of what I don't know you mentioned
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
you know you look at resources in the
 
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
huddles you look at resources the
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
numbers Etc in the question was is it
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
the resources of the patient or the
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
resources of facility that receiving the
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
patient It's usually the resources I
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
mean it's both right you're assessing a
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
patients needs and then you're looking
 
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:47.559 align:start position:0%
at what resources that you have within
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
those involuntary beds within the state
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
so sometimes you'll have somebody that
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
comes into a hospital that wants to be
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
served in that community area but
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
there's a bed available somewhere else
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
and so it's really working with is that
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
going to be an okay solution for that um
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
person to be transferred there or they
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
going to stay where they where they came
 
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
in so just a quick followup then so the
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
resources I just want to be clear that
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
the resources are not a patient driven
 
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
you know exercise meaning that if you
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources you can still
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
find a bed that you you need and yes yes
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
yes I I was talking of resources in
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
terms of beds availability
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:29.799 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner for taking the
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
question in regards to following up
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards when we look at the
 
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.830 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards when we look at the
state

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
budget what do we think we have to again
 
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
as get through the budgetary process not
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
everything is funded by the federal
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
government some of it's F funded by the
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
state um treasury if you will state
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
budget is there enough money in that
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
process now with the current budget to
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
do what we need to do to meet the target
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
here are we looking to somehow
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
enhance that budget to make sure this
 
00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:02.350 align:start position:0%
enhance that budget to make sure this
program's

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
program's
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
successful no I would agree it's a it's
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
a combination of federal funds and
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
general funds and I think at this point
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
we're where we're leveraged is you know
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
obviously we're starting the budget
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
planning phases for for next bium and
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
there's are things that we're looking at
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
so this is money that is current that we
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
currently have I'm not necessarily
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
thinking that it's going to be a major
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
increase for
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
that any other questions for the
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner on this subject
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the commissioner
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.549 --> 00:32:39.559 align:start position:0%
here I would say that as a resident of
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
Hamstead the more detailed
 
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
information about the YDC new building
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
that could be shared with Town officials
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
would only be for the
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
better um I realize as a state building
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be approved by the
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
town planning board but I think they'd
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
like to take a look in Greater detail at
 
00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:12.590 align:start position:0%
like to take a look in Greater detail at
things

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
um as State Rep for
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
Hamstead um I get a lot of calls and we
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
all know some of the calls are
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
just what they are but we also hear some
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
that make some sense
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
and I think the more
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
communication with both Town officials
 
00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:35.909 align:start position:0%
communication with both Town officials
and

00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
citizens on the issues they are
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned about will help
 
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
the project going
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
forward would you like me to respond to
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
that only if you want to I I would agree
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to also be afforded
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to communicate we have
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
we have information that we have been
 
00:33:57.389 --> 00:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
trying to communicate and share that I
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
know too haven't always been successful
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
so I I agree there's there's nothing to
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
hide here we want to be able to share
 
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:05.559 align:start position:0%
what we have and have good discussion
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
and um good questions on it um I think
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
we're we're ready for that opportunity
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
so and me now speaking to some folks who
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
aren't here there's better ways to
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
receive information when it's
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
offered sure so I'm happy to I tell
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
people I'm in the middle of the road and
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
they inform me that's where the
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
roadkills often f found but uh that's
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
other than the salary that's why I'm in
 
00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.149 align:start position:0%
other than the salary that's why I'm in
this

00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
bureau chief at developmental services
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
so you'll be seeing her and hearing from
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
her so happy to have her on
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
board um as you know um and I think as
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
we've been reporting um ongoing at this
 
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
committee as far as the financial weight
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
list for DD ABD Services remains at zero
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
everybody who has requested funding for
 
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
services are funded um I think from this
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
committee the ask generally has been for
 
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.510 align:start position:0%
committee the ask generally has been for
those

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
funded um who is getting services and at
 
00:35:46.589 --> 00:35:46.599 align:start position:0%
what level of services are they
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
receiving those services so are they
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
getting half of them are they getting um
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
a third of those services that have been
 
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
authorized um as you know um and has
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
been previously stated in um other um
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
oversight committees uh before New
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um easy not sorry before New
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire leads which was the system
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
that the area agencies and oursel used
 
00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:14.839 align:start position:0%
before that went down that's how we
 
00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:17.079 align:start position:0%
tracked a lot of that
 
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
information um I'm excited to report
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
we're making some progress on the on our
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
it side um to make up for um data and
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
the information that was lost during um
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
that uh data breach and consequently um
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
closing that system that we had used in
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the area agencies
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
before so um June 28th we're expecting a
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
release um from our it system that will
 
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
help um as far as identifying start
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
dates for each service that somebody's
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
authorized for um and then we'll
 
00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
automate some processes that are
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
currently manual for service
 
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
coordinators and area agencies so
 
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
aligning um service authorizations with
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
dates of service will be
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
automatic also um we are meeting with
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
area agencies probably in July um to
 
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
review and reinforce their role in um
 
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
noting in the system if somebody um is
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
has a delay in service why is there a
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
delay in service so we can then pull
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
directly from the system to get that
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
data um the way we were doing it before
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
was manual and because of all the system
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
changes and strengthening it was just
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's not something that we can put on
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
the system right now to to continue to
 
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
track manually so that's why you see a
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
little bit of lack of that data as far
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
as um you know the reasons why Services
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
were authorized but not
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
started in the report here um you can
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
see that for the DD waiver this past I
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
think this is the second quarter so
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking um Quarter Two of this
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um 40 individuals were
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
funded for services out of those 40
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
individuals 17 were projected to start
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
those services within quarter two and
 
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
then in actuality 12 started services
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
with um with uh either that's receiving
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
full services or partial
 
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
Services as the data uh improves we're
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
hoping to break that down as far as full
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
or partial what that means um as it
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
relates to authorized services so um
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
we're we're excited for the the it
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
improvements and hopefully that'll help
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
also give this committee information as
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
we're um looking at um the services
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
provided for the DD and the ABD waiver
 
00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.589 align:start position:0%
provided for the DD and the ABD waiver
moving

00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
moving
 
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
forward um so for the in home supports
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
waiver we funded 12 individuals in
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
quarter 2 nine were projected um to
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
start services and out of those 97
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
started either receiving full or partial
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
Services during that quarter and then
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
lastly um for the ABD waiver the
 
00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorder waiver we had
 
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
one individual that was funded however
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
they chose not to start Services um in
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
quarter or two so they did not start
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
services but that was their choosing to
 
00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.349 align:start position:0%
services but that was their choosing to
do

00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
so um I think as previously discussed um
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
in talking with area agencies providers
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
service coordinators um the the
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
struggles are still the same as far as
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce um as far as limited vendor
 
00:39:45.309 --> 00:39:45.319 align:start position:0%
capacity but I believe that is improving
 
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
as you know we're out there we're
 
00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
providing funding um in area agencies
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
and and other providers are coming on
 
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
board and enrolling directly into
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to provide services I think
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
we'll see
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
um the fruits of that labor um but it's
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
still you know as as all agencies are
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
struggling with with Workforce um that
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
that is still the number one issue that
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
we hear not only from area agencies but
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
our providers as well that provide the
 
00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
services in the community just to note
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
um we did previously issue 27 Workforce
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
grants for home and community- based
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
waiver Services which was about $16
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
million that was infused into the HCB BS
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
or Home and Community Based system we
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
recently had posted an uh an additional
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
Grant opportunity um and at that they
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
those have not been granted yet but
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
we're um assuming about $6.5 million do
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
would be appropriated again for
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retention efforts for
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
Home and Community Based Services so
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to see um that that has an
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
impact on not only recruiting people
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
into into the industry but also um to
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
retain them and move them um along you
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
know if they if they choose to do so
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.109 --> 00:41:10.119 align:start position:0%
opportunities there a couple other
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
updates if I can if you're interested um
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
we use a system called New Hampshire
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
easy um which is something that the area
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
agencies have used for a long time um as
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
far as you know getting information from
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh our department
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
we are currently piloting New Hampshire
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
easy with actual service providers in
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
the community so then they can see that
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
information that's in there without
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
having to go to either a service
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
coordinator an area agency or BDS
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
ourselves um kind of we're we're we're
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
cutting out the middleman so the
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
provider can directly go into the system
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
and see what services have been
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
authorized for their individuals that
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
they serve so that's currently in
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
piloting process um with with a provider
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
that was part of a steering committee
 
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.790 align:start position:0%
that was part of a steering committee
for

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
you for the report um so what I'm
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
wondering is we have the 40 new
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
individuals U allocated funds for the
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at the DD waiver
 
00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.670 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at the DD waiver
um

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
and 17 were projected to start services
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming that means that five are
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
waiting for the right Pro care provider
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce to come
 
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
along tell me about the other 28 people
 
00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
and and where they are in the process or
 
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
what's happening with them just so I
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
know the other 28 people I well you've
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
got you've got 40 new individuals
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
approved for services and maybe I've
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
I've uh 17 have been projected to start
 
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.230 align:start position:0%
I've uh 17 have been projected to start
so

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
um 23 other people have been funded are
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
not projected to start services so where
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
are they in the process and what's
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
happening right so some of those um
 
00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
individuals may start in the next
 
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
quarter so they might have been funded
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
for Quarter Two um but either they're
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
waiting for uh it could be anything it
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
could be waiting for exiting for school
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
it could be uh paperwork concerns it's
 
00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
it's a myriad of of concerns or or
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
issues that might hold up uh even
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
personal choice maybe they don't want to
 
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
start Services till after summer
 
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:41.559 align:start position:0%
vacation so to speak so um and I think
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
looking at our data system we want to
 
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
break down that number as well so if if
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
if we're getting requests for funding
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
and we're you know we're saying we've
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
allocated certain you know 40 people to
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
be funded and only 17 have started we w
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
we also want to know you know um out of
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
those why have they not started or what
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
is it person Choice yeah is it personal
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
and I think that's part of our data
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
integration we want that number broken
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
down um where it's not a manual process
 
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
to put you know on our service
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
coordinators to continue to do that
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
right but yes that's certainly something
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
in another quarter we might have better
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
information hoping yes we're hoping that
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
the next time we come to you that we'll
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
have it might not be perfect and might
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
not be everything that you're looking
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
for but hopefully it's um more of a
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
breakdown of some of these numbers as to
 
00:44:32.829 --> 00:44:32.839 align:start position:0%
you know if somebody was funded why did
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
they not start or if they started why is
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for the report and
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
also taking the question in regards to
 
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
it says 40 new
 
00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:51.559 align:start position:0%
individuals two questions if I may Mr
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
chair one is how many people applied and
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
were not accepted
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
and then how many people we have in the
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
current system because the 40 is only
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
for new versus existing so there's two
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions how many do we have existing
 
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:08.839 align:start position:0%
that are not part of the new and how
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
many people who applied did not receive
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
approval the the second question as far
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
as how many people have applied and not
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
accepted I don't have that with me today
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
but I can um get that information
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
currently um and Jess might know how
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
many folks currently are being D on the
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
DD waiver it's somewhere in the area of
 
00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:33.079 align:start position:0%
4500 individuals currently receiving
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
Services through the developmental
 
00:45:34.359 --> 00:45:36.630 align:start position:0%
Services through the developmental
disabilities

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
waiver thank you thank you for that it
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
helps me to understand the magnitude of
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about 4500 versus 40
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
is kind of interesting the other one we
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
have the numbers about who applied it
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
did not receive approval is why they
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
didn't receive approval is trying to
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
understand what it is that is either a
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
constraint or a barrier for them um and
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
that something we can do legislatively
 
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
you might you be able to shoot the
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee an email with that yes I will
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
questions and Miss Gorton I don't know
 
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
if I have your business card yet some
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
point because you are only part of you
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
phone oh sure uh pick a card any card
 
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
good thank you don't hand that to them
 
00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.630 align:start position:0%
good thank you don't hand that to them
that's

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:51.079 align:start position:0%
you I lost your phone by the way I lost
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
my phone so I lost your phone number I
 
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
can get that to you you're welcome just
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the team
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
here here's our
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
Conta dark just
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
happened well thank you thank you how
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
long was it between your request for
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
cards and your reception of cards I'm
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
really digging into this
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
one too long is the answer
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
right too long I don't think is bad I
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
think that's not too too bad it's
 
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
it could I put that in the
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
minutes don't put that in the minutes
 
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.309 align:start position:0%
minutes don't put that in the minutes
thank

monitoring program system administrator
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to take you through a
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
fairly lengthy packet in as
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
quickly a time as I can I'm going to
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
point out what we think at the
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program are
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
the most important elements of it and
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
then I would be happy to answer any
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
questions you might
 
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
have to get things started if you would
 
00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
expenses I'm going to be referencing
 
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
something called Gateway a little bit
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
later the core pdmp system is made up of
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
two pieces of software the basic system
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
is called aware that is where all of the
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
prescription data is stored the other
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
piece is called Gateway what this allows
 
00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:34.799 align:start position:0%
it it allows Physicians and pharmacist
 
00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
to directly access the other system from
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
within their electronic health record
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
systems instead of having to log in
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
through a separate web portal uh earlier
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
on before my time we received feedback
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
that logging in was combersome and it
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
took way too long per patient we heard
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
that concern we took action to make sure
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%
that that would no longer be a barrier
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
we'll see further on that this is a good
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
investment on our
 
00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
end if you would turn to page six
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
highlights for State fiscal year
 
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:11.559 align:start position:0%
2023 our total registration count is
 
00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:13.799 align:start position:0%
down this is primarily because of things
 
00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
like retirements moving out of state or
 
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
no longer carrying a DEA license which
 
00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:21.079 align:start position:0%
means that those users would not be
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
eligible to be connected to our
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
system um
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
despite a decrease in the number of
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
users the number of queries to our
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
system from Physicians and pharmacists
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
have gone up dramatically and we can
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
attribute a lot of that to Gateway as
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see just a little bit
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
later overall opioid prescriptions are
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
down year-over-year as our sedatives and
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
stimulants have continued to rise
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
year-over-year I have a little bit more
 
00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.910 align:start position:0%
year-over-year I have a little bit more
on

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
that if you move to page eight Gateway
 
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
integration you can see that the
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
overwhelming rise in the number of
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
queries made to our system by physicians
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
and pharmacists come from the Gateway
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
integration we have made it much easier
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
for the prescribers and the pharmacists
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
to use the pdmp and they are clearly
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
that next if you would like to go
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
to page 16 days Supply an average
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
morphine milligram equivalent I would
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
just want to point this out so that
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
there are no concerns you'll see that
 
00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:36.799 align:start position:0%
there is an aggressive and somewhat
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
alarming looking jump in the line on
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
this graph that is because CDC changed
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
the way milligram morphine equivalents
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
are calculated on that year it is not
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
because patients within the state of New
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are receiving dramatically
 
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
opioids turning over to the very next
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
page New Hampshire resident age at date
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
of opioid dispensation we can see that
 
00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
opioid prescriptions are down across
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
every age
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
category um it is not that any
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
one portion of the state are receiving
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
less opioid prescriptions it is that in
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
every County and in every age group
 
00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
people are feeling the need to use
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
opioid prescriptions less and we
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
and would you Al would you
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
also um believe that providers are being
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
more cautious and looking for
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
Alternatives I do believe that to be the
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
case especially if we consider that the
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
use of the pdmp system by providers has
 
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
been going up year overy year and we can
 
00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:52.839 align:start position:0%
see the corresponding decrease in the
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
total uh opioid prescriptions and more
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
importantly a increase in the number of
 
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
people who are receiving more than 100
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
milligram morphine equivalent per day
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
those are the ones who are at the
 
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
highest risk for developing substance
 
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:53:17.549 --> 00:53:17.559 align:start position:0%
question yeah could we uh jump in with
 
00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
some questions on what given us so far
 
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
and then absolutely pick up from there
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I'm just on page
 
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
two thank you Mr chair uh what what do
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
you know the RSA under that organized
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
the pdmp uh the current RSA for the pdmp
 
00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
is RSA
 
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
126a um and I believe it's 89 through
 
00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:43.720 align:start position:0%
starts at
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
87 I I didn't hear the second uh we
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
think it starts at 87 um and okay I can
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
figure it out from there uh and I'm just
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
I'm just having uh literary problems
 
00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
this morning morning it's under data
 
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
analysis uh it says review and Analysis
 
00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.069 align:start position:0%
analysis uh it says review and Analysis
or

00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
pdmp data is is that meant to be of yes
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
it is okay because that was the ores
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
were just throwing me off all right
 
00:54:12.119 --> 00:54:12.870 align:start position:0%
were just throwing me off all right
thank

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
you any other questions on the report so
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
far representative
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question in the
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
middle of the presentation um having
 
00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
used the pdmp in the past in your right
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
it was terribly
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
burdensome um does the Gateway allow uh
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
access to the um uh to the system by a
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
proxy for a physician now or does it
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
have to be provider does it have to be
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
the provider it's himself or herself
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
doing it uh each setup is dependent on
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
the electronic health record system
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
itself but it is designed to be accessed
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
from right within the prescribing
 
00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
portion of an electronic health record
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
system which means that the physician is
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
accessing it directly at the moment that
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
prescription followup followup um quick
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
followup um and I appreciate also that
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
the number of opioids is going down
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
because there was a time in the 80s and
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
early 990s as you remember you may
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
remember that was considered a fifth
 
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
Vital sign was pain so my question is
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%
what is now used as a substitute for the
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
opioid opioids now that um is being used
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
so that patients are getting adequate
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
treatment uh the current best practices
 
00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:35.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations it depends on the type
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
of pain being described so as an
 
00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
example previous to my time joining the
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
pdmp uh the pdmp did work with the uh
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire oral health program to
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
distribute best practices guidelines to
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
dentists throughout the state uh a
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
combination of acetaminophen and
 
00:55:59.470 --> 00:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
ibuprofen Tylenol and ibuprofen works
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
better after a dental procedure than
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
opioids do and we saw a drop in the
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
opioid prescriptions for normal dental
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
procedures where they may not be as
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
non-opioids thank
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and I I just want to uh
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
I'm channeling representative Dr Nagle
 
00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:28.430 align:start position:0%
I'm channeling representative Dr Nagle
now

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
um make a plea for those people
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
who um we occasionally hear about those
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
who are in chronic long-term pain cancer
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
patients terminal patients uh who are
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
and and also others living with chronic
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
pain um who feel that
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
they are not given enough options um and
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm remembering back when my late
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
husband was U had metastatic bone
 
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
disease back in the late
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
80s um he could have hot and cold
 
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.549 align:start position:0%
80s um he could have hot and cold
running

00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
running
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
msir and and chose that route rather
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
than Ms conton because he could control
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
how much he had in his system at any
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
time and so we were at that point able
 
00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
to have a very large supply of very lowd
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
dose pills in our house and I don't know
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
if that's the case anymore but um and
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure that you delve into
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
that aspect of things from where you sit
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
which is really monitoring the
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
flow uh but have you been hearing
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
anything about issues of
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
people genuine needing and and not being
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
able to receive dosages that are um
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
necessary for them we have not been
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
notified of any substantial problems
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
across the state for the people who do
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
need the opioid prescriptions to control
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
chronic pain they do seem to still be
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
getting them what we are seeing is
 
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
mostly a decrease in
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
opioid in high risk
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
prescribing and that is mostly the ones
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
you representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
chair and also thank you for the report
 
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
it's well documented well done in
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
regards to I think by if I understand it
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
correctly the data comes from the
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
pharmacies themselves when they dispense
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
the medication to a patient so that's
 
00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
all been by the RSA required to be
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
reported to somewhere but my question is
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
within somewhere within the department
 
00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
where does that data get
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
parked that data is received by the uh
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
the core aware software that our vendor
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
provides for us and that is where it
 
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
lands that is where it stays so I so the
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
data is not internal to New Hampshire
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's actually within the vendor that is
 
00:59:03.549 --> 00:59:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.029 --> 00:59:06.039 align:start position:0%
you representative Edwards with a
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
followup to representative Merchant's
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
question so so I'm really very
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
um collecting the data storing the data
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
analyzing the data that uh and sharing
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
the data with other interested parties
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
like for example the Department of
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
Insurance also collects a lot of data on
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals and so and and the
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
has a similar requirement so my my
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
thought on this is we seem to have
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
different uh data collection efforts
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
that are possible um it
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
or does does the core aware software
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
also do those as a service do they do
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
the uh analysis and Reporting and
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
queries for you uh they do provide us
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
with a tableau instance where our data
 
00:59:59.950 --> 00:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
analyst can go in and look at aggregate
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
data um it is important to note that our
 
01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
analyst is not digging into personally
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
identifiable data we do aggregate
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
analysis um when it comes to access to
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable data that is
 
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
limited specifically to the Physicians
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
and pharmacists that access that's good
 
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
I wasn't asking about privacy but but
 
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
thank you does that data analyst
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
employed by the state or or that's a
 
01:00:29.789 --> 01:00:29.799 align:start position:0%
state employee doing the data anal
 
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:32.839 align:start position:0%
analyst is a state employee the Tableau
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
dashboards that have been set up for us
 
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
are set up by the vendor and we have the
 
01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:38.839 align:start position:0%
ability to make our own as well all
 
01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:41.799 align:start position:0%
right outstanding thank
 
01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
you all right you may continue your
 
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
right is if you would turn to the top
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
pdmp user roles and patient request
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
activity uh 1 2 3 4 5
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
24 30 uh
 
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:19.029 align:start position:0%
24 30 uh
30

01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
five my apologies mine are condensed and
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
not numbered so I have to count as I go
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
along uh what you can see is that at
 
01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:28.839 align:start position:0%
this moment we are still in a phase
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
where most of the queries are being run
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
by delegates for prescribers uh at this
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
time slightly less than 30% of all of
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
the uh healthc care facilities in the
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
state that could Connect using Gateway
 
01:01:44.349 --> 01:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
are on board with it that is an ongoing
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
effort on our part we are continuing to
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
work facility by facility to get them
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
connected so that that way the
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
Physicians are the ones who are using it
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh speaking to data sharing uh if you
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
go one two three four five uh six pages
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
forward we have a slide on data sharing
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
these are the states that we have
 
01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:14.119 align:start position:0%
Interstate data sharing agreements with
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh what this means is that prescribers
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
and pharmacists in those states are also
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
able to query our system that way if we
 
01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
have New Hampshire residents that uh
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
spend a portion of their year in another
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
state their Physicians have access to
 
01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.309 align:start position:0%
state their Physicians have access to
complete

01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
records if I may
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
Mr Mr
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
chair clar clarification question on the
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
data when it's going into the
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
vendor because we have strict privacy
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
laws in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
what's to ensure that if the data is
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
going to another state that that state
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
is not getting into Data that we have on
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
our patients if you will are they
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
following and how do they do this follow
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
our state law so that our state law is
 
01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.109 align:start position:0%
our state law so that our state law is
not

01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
being bypassed if you will when it gets
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
to another state thank you for the
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
question uh the way an interstate data
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
access works is we first have to
 
01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:20.839 align:start position:0%
determine that the state that we have an
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
interstate data sharing agreement with
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
has security measures in place to make
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
sure that only authorized us users that
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
would be able to access our system if
 
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
they were New Hampshire prescribers or
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacists are allowed to make those
 
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
Interstate queries uh none of the data
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
from our system goes into those other
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
state systems it is held completely
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
within our own and it is only the
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
authorized users that if they were New
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licensed Physicians or
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
it representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you again taking the
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
question um number one do you know if uh
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
DH is using the DH System is using the
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
Gateway uh product and the other
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
question is is this dependent upon the
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
electronic health record that they use
 
01:04:12.269 --> 01:04:12.279 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not they can access
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
Gateway meaning many of them are on Epic
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
right now is that epic compatible with
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
Gateway right now epic is compatible
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
each installation of Epic is slightly
 
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
different and each one has to be
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
configured one at a time but epic all
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
Epic installations are capable of making
 
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:30.839 align:start position:0%
a Gateway integration at this time
 
01:04:33.789 --> 01:04:33.799 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth is not yet connected through
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.799 --> 01:04:42.349 align:start position:0%
 
process

01:04:42.349 --> 01:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
followup you you led me down this road
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
yourself uh what is what do you mean by
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
this process an ongoing process a
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
portion of Dartmouth is connected the
 
01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
pharmacy within Dartmouth is connected
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
through Gateway um the main hospital so
 
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
Physicians practicing within Dartmouth
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
are not yet
 
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
connected Vox clant in
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
deserto yeah go ahead is there a reason
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
why they are
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
not that is an excellent
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
question the initial funding that
 
01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:17.430 align:start position:0%
question the initial funding that
covered

01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
covered
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
Gateway uh ended in the at the end of
 
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
September of this year and the source of
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
funding that we applied to to follow on
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
to that was not guaranteed our ability
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
as the state to cover the cost of
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
Gateway was not assured until after we
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
received the award um if you flip I know
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to send you all the way back
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
to the beginning pretty much uh if you
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
flip to page five the pdmp is fully
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
federally funded we get two funding
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
sources uh one is the overdose data to
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
action Grant which put a uh funding
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
limitation on how much pdmps were
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to receive from that and the
 
01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:57.799 align:start position:0%
other one is the Harold Rogers
 
01:05:59.710 --> 01:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
grant that 2-year funding source is
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
competitive slightly less than half of
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
all states in the nation received it
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
this year um without both of those we
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
would not be able to cover the costs of
 
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
Gateway which would mean prescribers or
 
01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:15.799 align:start position:0%
facilities would have to cover the costs
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
themselves that was the way the previous
 
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
uh contract with our vendor was written
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
with the in mind that we were going to
 
01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
pursue uh funding to continue supplying
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
it for those users we were awarded the
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
funds and the contract amendment was
 
01:06:34.349 --> 01:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
approved by governor and Council so
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
there were a number of facilities that
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
were waiting to see what was going to
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
funding maybe Dartmouth could make a
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
contribution you think perhaps okay
 
01:06:50.269 --> 01:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
can't speak for them though right okay
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
chair and also thank you for the uh the
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
information on the cost of the program
 
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
going back through a page four when I
 
01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
look at the technology expenses that I
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
think only refers to the technology is
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
there other expenses within the program
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
and if there are how are they funded
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
there are other expenses to the program
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
we have four staff members myself uh our
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy auditor our data analyst and
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
our uh Administrative Assistant uh they
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
are also covered by those two Federal
 
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.390 align:start position:0%
are also covered by those two Federal
funding

01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
sources follow up so looking at it being
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
competitive what happens if we don't
 
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
have the federal grants are we going
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
back to the state treasury to find out
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
how to support the program I'm just
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
looking down the road and saying come
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
2025 there's a termination on those
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
grants um is there any thought in the
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
budgetary process going forward to what
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
to do to offset the loss of those
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
grants for uh that is something that we
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
keep track of internally at all times it
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
is top of mind every day um at the end
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
of this two-year funding period there is
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
an expectation that there will be a new
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
two-year funding opportunity we are
 
01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
anticipating applying for it at this
 
01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
time um if we were to be limited to only
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
one of the two current funding sources
 
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
we would not be able to continue paying
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
for a gateway directly and we have
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
explored options for how to cover the
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
cost for that
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
way please
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
continue uh the last thing that I would
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
like to point out is oh got to count
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
again uh 6 12
 
01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:52.990 align:start position:0%
again uh 6 12
24

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
3 35 34 uh page 32 uh prescription
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
auditing error type and severity
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to any data system the
 
01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
ability to rely on what's inside of that
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
data system relies entirely on the
 
01:09:11.149 --> 01:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
quality of the data coming in through
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
the tireless efforts of our uh of our
 
01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy auditor Leslie Pond we can say
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
with a high degree of certainty that
 
01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
when a physici accesses our system they
 
01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
are getting accurate information in
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
return we have an above 99% data
 
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:35.189 align:start position:0%
return we have an above 99% data
accuracy

01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
rate and that is all I have good thank
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%

which is the role I'm here today in
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
excellent so the main purpose of today's
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
presentation is to share some highlights
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
from that report that full report that
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
you all have uh suicide prevention is an
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
important public health issue demanding
 
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
a really comprehensive and multifaceted
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
approach to make a meaningful impact
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
addressing this pervasive challenge
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
necessitates an approach that goes
 
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
beyond just mental health counseling so
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
it requires a broad array of services
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
that span Mental Health Care Community
 
01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
Support education and a lot of Outreach
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
initiatives but the most important
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
message that we try to get out as the
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention council is that there
 
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
is Hope and suicide is generally
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
preventable so collaboration you'll
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
notice is throughout that entire report
 
01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
especially in the first many pages uh
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
collaboration between healthc care
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
providers Educators policy makers
 
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
Community leaders is essential to create
 
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
a unified front against a Public Health
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
Challenge so it emphasizes the need for
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
ongoing research policy development and
 
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
resource allocation to truly make a
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
difference in the lives of New Hampshire
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
residents so I'm going to jump into um
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
the slides that we have in this packet
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
here um in the beginning before we talk
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
about sort of data and trends that we
 
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
found I just want to make sure um that
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%

up of and how it operates so on that
 
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.000 align:start position:0%

awareness that suicide is a preventable
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
public health problem and together we
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
can raise awareness increase access to
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%

created a position for treasurer to
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
assist with effective use of available
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
funds the SPC is administratively tied
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
to DHHS and benefits from their
 
01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.070 align:start position:0%
to DHHS and benefits from their
professional

01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
professional
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
guidance next is committees on that
 
01:14:38.709 --> 01:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
following page and this is really where
 
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
the heart of the council truly resides
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's within the work of these committees
 
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
we currently have six Active committees
 
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
plus a conference uh planning work group
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
so statutory members and also others who
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
are not uh statutory members of of the
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
council contribute to the committee's
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
work so just a couple examples of things
 
01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
that the Committees have accomplished um
 
01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
our Communications committee spent all
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
of 2023 standing up a website for The
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention Council which is now
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
publicly available and sharing
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
information uh our survivors of suicide
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
loss committee holds multiple events
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the year for those who are
 
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
who are on their own journey of healing
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
public policy committee is an instrument
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
in helping to educate not only our
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
council members but others about issues
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
that impact Suicide Prevention in the
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
past two years the military and veterans
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
committee has focused on engaging
 
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
Community providers in military culture
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
training and suicide prevention training
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
and they've tracked
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
1,575 hours of training taken by
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
Community providers as a specific result
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
of their efforts and the first responder
 
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
committee hosts annual school resource
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
officer conference to support their work
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
with atrisk youth the conference
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
planning workg group is currently
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
preparing for the 21st annual Suicide
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
Prevention Conference next year um or
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
this coming November so that's attended
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
every year by about 200 to 300
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
individuals across the state the next
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
slide jumps into the actual report uh
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
the suicide the The Suicide Prevention
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
council is required to produce this
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
annual report outlining the status of
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention work across New
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as Trends found in the
 
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
latest confirmed data the data helps
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
inform which populations age groups are
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
most at risk reveals points of
 
01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
particular particular vulnerability and
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
then helps guide prevention and
 
01:16:45.149 --> 01:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
intervention efforts sources of data
 
01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
include Vital Records data for the State
 
01:16:49.229 --> 01:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and the national
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
violence death reporting system and more
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
details in the full report around page 2
 
01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
7 it goes into quite extensive detail
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
about the sources of data so as you may
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
be aware it's important to note that
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
there's always a lag in confirmed data
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
um the CDC for example takes several
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
months to collect data um then confirm
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
it compile it and release it so because
 
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
of that delay most of the data found in
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
the 2022 report that you have is
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
reflective of
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
2021 it's also important to note that
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
the report is really only a snapshot
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
granted it's a very comprehensive
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
snapshot um but it's nearly impossible
 
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
to capture and catalog every instance or
 
01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
program aimed at Suicide Prevention in
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
the state the elements are on the next
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
page just really quickly gives you sort
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
of a lay of the land for what's in the
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
report and how to navigate it it's 91
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive great I get to kick us off
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
with some of the key points that were
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
you know rising to the top from our data
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
committee who compiles this report for
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
us annually um so this is all available
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
to you in the infographic that was a
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
companion document uh that you should
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
all have in front of you so you can
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
follow along with the slides or you can
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
look at the infographic as I go through
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
um so right at the top of that there
 
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
were in 2021 229 individuals who died by
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
suicide in New
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it is the second leading
 
01:18:27.629 --> 01:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
cause of death ages 15 to 34 it's the
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
10th leading cause of death overall
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
across all ages some folks are
 
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
interested in how the suicide rate
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
compares to the homicide rate um so
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
suicides outnumber homicides in the US
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
and uh the same is true over New
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where there are 12 suicides
 
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
for every
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
homicide and uh the last figure on this
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
slide is that of all firearm deaths 89%
 
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
of them are from suicide or intentional
 
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:55.870 align:start position:0%
of them are from suicide or intentional
self

01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
self
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
harm in the US this number is closer to
 
01:18:58.679 --> 01:19:03.270 align:start position:0%
harm in the US this number is closer to
about

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
66% the next page shows uh really
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
focuses on some of the geography and
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
locations in New Hampshire and we like
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
to look at Trends here to determine
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
where in the state we might Infuse
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
additional resources Suicide Prevention
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
or postvention training or awareness
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
campaigns so you'll see the the uh
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
picture that you see there shows that
 
01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
we're really New Hampshire at a
 
01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
16.06 suicide rate is in the middle of
 
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
the range seen across all New England
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
states uh at a county level which you
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
can see in the full report we are able
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
to learn that Coos County experienced
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
the highest suicide rate in 20 uh 21 in
 
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
straford County experience the lowest
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm having trouble tracking you what
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
what what what page is the map with the
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
counties that is in the full report so
 
01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
in the 91 page full report I can get you
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
the exact page though and I have an
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
extra copy if you would like to look at
 
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
it I'll flip through it okay great
 
01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:05.450 align:start position:0%
figure 14 page on page
 
01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:11.030 align:start position:0%
figure 14 page on page
[Laughter]

01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
32 is that online as well and if so
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
could you send us a link to it yeah
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely because that probably is the
 
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
easiest way for many of us to get a hold
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
of it yep
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um on this next page where
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
really focusing on the adult data and so
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
fatality data is really only one part of
 
01:20:32.669 --> 01:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
the picture when we're thinking about
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
suicidality in New Hampshire and so um
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
The Human Experience just is incredibly
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
complex and so human lives are filled
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
with grief and loss and pain um so these
 
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
figures really show that um there were
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
about 52,000 adults overall who had
 
01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts of suicide and then there were
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
about 3,500 adults who attempted suicide
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
and so really thinking about you know
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
trying to get more Upstream to to Really
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
Provide support for those in um in need
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
it's not that people want to die it's
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
that they just want their pain to end
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
and so um a couple of the additional
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
things is that my job is really to take
 
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
this information and then to put it into
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
to programs and make improvements on
 
01:21:20.669 --> 01:21:20.679 align:start position:0%
existing things it's noted that
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
affordability and accessibility are two
 
01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
of the key barriers for people who want
 
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
to access you know timely Mental Health
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
Care um when they need it so there's a
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
couple of efforts that I just wanted to
 
01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
point out in relation to this data the
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
first regarding affordability is that
 
01:21:37.149 --> 01:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
there is a study commission currently
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
going on S sp85 that's related to the
 
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
sustainability of Crisis
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
services in addition there's been some
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
crisis system transformation to reduce
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
barriers to accessing crisis Services
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
when a person needs it and where they
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
need it that's through our rapid
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
response access point and 988 that was
 
01:21:57.629 --> 01:21:57.639 align:start position:0%
the national three-digit number that's
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
been released we really are hoping to
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
encourage folks to call early and call
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
often when they are in their time of
 
01:22:07.149 --> 01:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
need and also we're really trying to
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
shift culture around defining what
 
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
culture is it's really defined by the
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
individual and so we want them to call
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
us when they are feeling overwhelmed or
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
um like really struggling so that they
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
um can get access earlier on and not
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
only think think that they can access
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
those Services when they're in a
 
01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:30.149 align:start position:0%
those Services when they're in a
suicidal

01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
crisis the next page is regarding youth
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
specifically so this is um taken from
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
our ybs data and looking broadly across
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
all students um 9.8 so almost 10% of
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
students overall um indicated that they
 
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:49.719 align:start position:0%
had made a suicide attempt one or more
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
times question in yes yeah go ahead
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative which I I was going to
 
01:22:59.229 --> 01:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
wait for you to take a breath there but
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about the students uh who
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
are prone to um suicide
 
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
ideation um is is there has there been
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
any research to
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
correlate um those that are most at risk
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
with the presence of two parent
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
families my my theory is that a student
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's in a two parent family is
 
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
probably less likely to have the
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
depression and the and the concerns that
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
can feed and the pain that can feed a
 
01:23:38.189 --> 01:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
mental illness um and I'm just curious
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
if that's something you all look into so
 
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
symptoms so I don't know if this mic is
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
fully reaching me over here but um I do
 
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
we do specifically look at risk and
 
01:23:55.629 --> 01:23:55.639 align:start position:0%
protective factors and those include
 
01:23:57.669 --> 01:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
individual risk factors some of which
 
01:23:59.870 --> 01:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
are fixed such as you know genetics just
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
like with any other health condition and
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
others of which are variable and that's
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
where we believe we can really make the
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
most um prevention intervention work and
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
so we look at those adverse childhood
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
experiences and adverse community
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
experiences and those include um to
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
their to your point more specific
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
question they they have things to do
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
with parental risk as well if a parent
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
is incarcerated if their the family has
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
experienced divorce if a parent has uh
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
experience depression that those are
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
things that can increase risk factors
 
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
and that having that information about
 
01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
our families that we're serving and the
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
students in the schools and things like
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
that allow us to then be responsive to
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
the type of prevention or intervention
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
we can offer we can offer that Universal
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
prevention that's for everyone but we
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
can also offer prevention that is either
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
selected people that have more risk
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
factors or indicated those who are
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
actually already showing
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
risk representative King thank you Mr
 
01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you for this is
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
just a continuation of that just going a
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
little deeper into the root
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
cause um I work pretty closely with a
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
Recovery Center in Milford New Hampshire
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
and um what we find with addiction uh
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder is uh isolation
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
has a lot to do with how people feel
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
about themselves and then uh there was a
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
report last June and uh that was was
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
about social media and the effects on
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
how uh these kids feel about themselves
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
and actually probably even adults um so
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
how does that fall into some of the
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
things that you look at yeah these are
 
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
great questions they are speaking to
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
some of those additional respector when
 
01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:42.280 align:start position:0%
we talked earlier about the county
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
differences as well as the geographic
 
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
differences throughout the United States
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
and sort of where New Hampshire falls it
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
does speak directly to some of the
 
01:25:52.109 --> 01:25:52.119 align:start position:0%
pieces around isolation access to
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Healthcare um Workforce
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
shortages in these in these regions
 
01:25:59.070 --> 01:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
access to lethal means in certain areas
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
and regions and so you see those risk
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
and protective Factor factors change
 
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
based on where we live and while social
 
01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:07.639 align:start position:0%
media is complex and could probably be
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
its entire own meeting if not multiple
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
um it it can contribute to isolation so
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
there are times when people are engaging
 
01:26:17.229 --> 01:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
in social media and creating connection
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
and there are other uses of it that
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
don't allow you to build relationships
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
and so it's really not necessarily how
 
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
much time are we spending but what are
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
we doing when we are
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
engaging representative Edwards uh thank
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um the the the the the
 
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
question got me interested in um um the
 
01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
governor's executive order I think it
 
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
was maybe eight months ago or so um
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
trying to um discourage social media use
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
amongst kids 14 years or younger I
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
forget exactly what that tradeoff was or
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
that that timeline was but um uh do do
 
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
do we think that social media um and
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
Adolescence is um basically um a a a
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
Channel or a
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
contagion that sort of propagates the
 
01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
the concerns that feed suicide ideation
 
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:15.639 align:start position:0%
do do do we have any correlation between
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
access and use of social media to the
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
propensity to have suicide
 
01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
ideation so again such a complex topic
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
but I think it it it does both things
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
where it social media can be a place to
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
identify students at risk and get them
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
the help that they need and be able to
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
intervene it can also be a place to make
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
sure to send out resources and sort of
 
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
promote things like call 988 if you're
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
at risk so you can use it as a
 
01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
prevention tool as well but if there is
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
increased um bullying or people are
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
facing victimization or discrimination
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
they are then also at increased risk so
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's a both things can be true situation
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
and what we need to do is really Empower
 
01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
Our Youth and make sure that they're
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
educated on what that looks like and how
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
it impacts
 
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
them I'm looking at the uh percentages
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
of all students who feel sad and
 
01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
hopeless and I want to break out sad
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
it's like whenever my wife was a doctor
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
says what's your pain level and I said
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's 10 she says why it's mine and of
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
other people uh less subjective might
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
say my pain is actually a four so how do
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
you deal with the question of what is
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
sad yes so the youth RIS Behavior survey
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
is qualitative so it's it's based on how
 
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
that student what that student believes
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
to when they feel sad or hopeless it's
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's identifying simply that they have
 
01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
felt sad and hopeless within the time
 
01:28:45.149 --> 01:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
period in which they're asked however
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
they would Define what that means so it
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
gives us a sense while those things may
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
be so different on our scale if we had
 
01:28:55.109 --> 01:28:55.119 align:start position:0%
Stu two students in front of us who both
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
answered yes to that question one may be
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
going through significant family trauma
 
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
had a recent loss something that we feel
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
like is a really challenging and another
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
may have had a recent breakup that we
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
would say hey plenty of fish in the sea
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
right so it's not about how we look at
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
what's going on with those students it's
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
about how they perceive their pain and
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
do you have a longitudinal marker on
 
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
this such as depression has to be
 
01:29:22.109 --> 01:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time before it's
 
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
really considered clinical depression
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
um how about sadness everybody's sad I'm
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised the number isn't 100% yeah
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so the way that that question is
 
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
worded is sad or hopeless for a period
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
of time over the like for a period of
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
longer than two weeks over the last
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
month something like that and I can't
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
remember the exact language but happy to
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
email it to you as well the way that the
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
question is worded okay good thank you
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
counselor uh representative
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair in looking
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
at the overall data one of the things
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's really catching my eye is the
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%
disparity between
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
gender and it's not slight it's in my
 
01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.109 align:start position:0%
gender and it's not slight it's in my
opinion

01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:30:05.709 --> 01:30:05.719 align:start position:0%
pronounced can you kind of speak to why
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's so pronounced what's sort of
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
driving that and also the other question
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
is when I look at the states that are in
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
the higher above average by the US it
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
seems to be states that have more of a
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
rural population but I'm trying to find
 
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
the map just look at it is more
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
prevalent in Rural America than it is in
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
urban America so the two questions is
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
number one why is there such a gender
 
01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
gap and then number two is there a
 
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
geographical one as
 
01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
well want me to take them sure okay so
 
01:30:37.109 --> 01:30:37.119 align:start position:0%
gender we tend to see in both nationally
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire that fatality is
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
higher amongst men and that making
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
suicide attempts is higher amongst
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
females and so what that tells us is
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
that what we're here really to talk
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
about is prevention and so we have many
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
many more people have thoughts of
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
suicide you know many many people
 
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
everybody to um your point earlier is
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
everyone feels sad or hopeless at times
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
but there is a smaller number of people
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
who experience suicidal ideation right
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
have thoughts of suicide and even
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
smaller number of those folks will make
 
01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
a plan and even smaller number of the
 
01:31:11.109 --> 01:31:11.119 align:start position:0%
people who make a plan will make an
 
01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
attempt and of those who make an attempt
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
an even smaller number will will
 
01:31:19.109 --> 01:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
actually have a a um die by Suicide and
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
so therefore what that tells us is that
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
there's a a lot of points for prot
 
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
potential intervention or to do good
 
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
prevention to prevent those fatalities
 
01:31:30.669 --> 01:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
and so what we see with those numbers
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
for for females is that we have a lot of
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
potential intervention and that what we
 
01:31:39.149 --> 01:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
know about the means by which people die
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
and are more likely to have to
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
experience fatality is that males tend
 
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
to choose more lethal means and so
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
there's less of opportunity for an
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
intervention and to save that a life and
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
so we look at policy that puts time
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
and distance between a person in crisis
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
and access to highly lethal
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
means and can you speak to the follow up
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
please thank you can you speak to the
 
01:32:07.109 --> 01:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
issue about geographic forgot it while I
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
was um just going on and on about the
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
first one so the other question about
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
geography you'll see both yes to your
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
question about is does it tend to be
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
higher in rural areas of both the
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
country and the state and then what what
 
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
we understand about some of those
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
differences include
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
oftentimes Workforce shortages and less
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
Economic Opportunity that can lead to
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
hopelessness we also socioeconomic
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
disparity lack of access to health care
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
including behavioral mental health
 
01:32:37.709 --> 01:32:37.719 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
services firearm ownership is often
 
01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
higher which is the most lethal means of
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
suicide um and housing instability food
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
instability all of these things kind of
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
come back to when we were talking about
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
those risk and protective factors so
 
01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
when we see those higher risk factors
 
01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
and the lower protective factors which
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
also include connectedness is a
 
01:32:59.070 --> 01:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
protective factor and so that isolation
 
01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.550 align:start position:0%
protective factor and so that isolation
is

01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
continue I don't know where I left off
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
um I feel like we've through discussion
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
I think we've like concluded our
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
conversation about the slide that I was
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
on other than just there's a note to to
 
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:22.280 align:start position:0%
on this slide about the increased
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of um um for students who
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
identify as LGB lgbq and latinx that
 
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
those are higher percentages for those
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
key demographics that were um surveyed
 
01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
in the ybs so we keep an eye on efforts
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
that specifically address those needs of
 
01:33:42.189 --> 01:33:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you Mr chairman and um
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the work that you do and
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
presenting this information to us um you
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
all sit with a very broad smile on your
 
01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.149 align:start position:0%
all sit with a very broad smile on your
face

01:33:57.149 --> 01:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
face
 
01:33:59.950 --> 01:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
and my experience over time is that
 
01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
these numbers have increased
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
substantially and I'm looking at
 
01:34:05.109 --> 01:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
particularly at the students and the
 
01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
kids and there was recently a a couple
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
dartman students have just passed away
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
and as you well aware of so I don't have
 
01:34:13.709 --> 01:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
to go through the history but it is
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
depressing to me to watch the trend line
 
01:34:19.229 --> 01:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
so my question is not a specific
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
question about the data and who is doing
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
it and why how do you protect yourselves
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
from um becoming impacted negatively
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
information I'll go first um I think
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
what the reason coming here is such a
 
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
good opportunity to to highlight what
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
the breadth of Suicide Prevention work
 
01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
to include the comp compilation of this
 
01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
data to help inform the that information
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
but just the membership of the council
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
the activities of the council can really
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
produce a lot of Hope there are pockets
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
of Excellence of community and sense of
 
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
belongingness and training and education
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
and awareness building that are
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
happening around the state and so while
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
we're here talking about you know the
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
fatality data that you know can really
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
be striking and and you know um alarming
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
and I think it's really important to
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
also root Eng ground ourselves in the
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
foundation of hope that our that our
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
state has really um supported Suicide
 
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
Prevention along the way and it's
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
through Partnerships um like presenting
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
here with Amy
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
um and being able to talk with you all
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
about some of the complicated nature of
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
suicidality as it presents and also to
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
highlight some of the efforts that we're
 
01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
do and I would add to that you know uh
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
the human component of looking out for
 
01:35:43.149 --> 01:35:43.159 align:start position:0%
each other in connection and I've seen
 
01:35:46.270 --> 01:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
an increase in that um among
 
01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
professionals over the past five or six
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
years I think we get so caught up in the
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
populations that we're looking at and
 
01:35:57.149 --> 01:35:57.159 align:start position:0%
the programs um and we so I'm also
 
01:35:58.910 --> 01:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
co-chair of our military and veterans
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
committee for this Council and have been
 
01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
for many years and we had sort of a
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
moment where we had to really look at
 
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
how we were supporting each other one of
 
01:36:12.109 --> 01:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
our own um members of that committee um
 
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
died by suicide last year and we thought
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
of all people who knew the
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
resources you know he was on the
 
01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
committee we talk about this every time
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
we meet so we really started to have
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
conversations around the table of how
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
are we caring for each other and how are
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
we looking out for each other and so
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
little even things like so we all
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
exchanged um you know phone numbers so
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
even just text messages once a week you
 
01:36:40.990 --> 01:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
know it's no we kind of have these group
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
check-ins of like Hey how do you like
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
the weather this week you know even just
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
those little reach out um T just
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
Connection in general so I've seen a lot
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
of things like that happen not only here
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire among professional
 
01:36:59.109 --> 01:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
groups but across the country as well
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
because I mean Healthcare it sounds like
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
you're in the healthcare field um from
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
some of the comments you've made I mean
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
that again is an area where they just
 
01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
have to look out for each other
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the work that you do
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so thank you so much for your
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
question I think that's what it's all
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
about is actually checking in with one
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
another um I think also no one just sort
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
of falls into this work so many of us
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
and you probably assume that most people
 
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
that are involved in behavioral health
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
or Suicide Prevention have experienced
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
losses of their own or are a person with
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
lived experience and so for me come to
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
the work because what is the New
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that I want my kids to grow up
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
in what do I want them to know and what
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
do and so it's aspirational right it's
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
where it's to I want to live in a state
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
where we make connections and not
 
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
judgments and my you know kindergartener
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
stood up in her classroom and said when
 
01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
you need police fire or ambulance you
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
call 911 and when you're sad angry or
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
feeling over overwhelmed you call 988
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
and when 5-year-olds tell each other
 
01:37:59.709 --> 01:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
that we're making a
 
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
difference any further questions
 
01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:03.629 align:start position:0%
difference any further questions
representative

01:38:03.629 --> 01:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
Weber well I think this is kind of a
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up to this question and also to
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
representative Edward's question about
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
the social media um I'm thinking about a
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
couple of interactions I had with
 
01:38:16.239 --> 01:38:17.790 align:start position:0%
couple of interactions I had with
teenage

01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
teenage
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
girls um over the last couple of years
 
01:38:26.589 --> 01:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
and um the social media thing which for
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
those of us who are dinosaurs is really
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
mindboggling because the conversation I
 
01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
was having
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
was can you imagine that I am not
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to use my social media after
 
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
11:00 at night and the first words that
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
came to my mind was when I was in your
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
age I was home at 5: and the door shut
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
and the telephone was supervised by my
 
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
parents and I made made myself not say
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
any of
 
01:38:56.639 --> 01:38:58.629 align:start position:0%
any of
that

01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
but part I mean it seems to me that it
 
01:39:03.950 --> 01:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
goes both ways I mean part of what she
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
was trying to tell me is I have to have
 
01:39:08.350 --> 01:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
access to my phone at 3:00 in the
 
01:39:10.109 --> 01:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
morning because one of my friends might
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
need me at 3:00 in the morning
 
01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
and sorting it seems to me that it's
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
much more difficult today to sort out
 
01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:26.679 align:start position:0%
the questions of
 
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's great for you to be there
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
for your friend it's also really not
 
01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:37.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate for you to never sleep which
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
is one of the results and not sleeping
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
is one of those things it's a real risk
 
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
factor so I wonder just if if if you um
 
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
could enlighten me a little bit if you
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
know about work that's done around that
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
kind of issue because it's it's both a
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
support and a
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
real risk taker quite aside from the
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
amplification of the nastiness that I
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
got away from by getting home and
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
closing my front door and you know the
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
nastiness follows the unkind I should
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
say unkindness that yeah happens um
 
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
follows kids everywhere and is
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
inescapable at this point my social
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
world ended when the lights when the
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
street lights came on I was due to be
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
home um I one an example I want to share
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
with you that I think speaks to exactly
 
01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about and helps in
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
that area um at Nami New Hampshire we do
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
a youth leader connect training and we
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
do it all across New Hampshire but we do
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
it in other states as well one of my
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues was just in Alaska working in
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
high schools doing this training and
 
01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:49.639 align:start position:0%
what so we train youth leaders and their
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
adult um counterparts in school
 
01:40:54.990 --> 01:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
districts to go out and be messagers
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
with within their school um all about
 
01:40:59.950 --> 01:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention how to deal with
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
those types of issues and one example we
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
give the the students um is the example
 
01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:09.639 align:start position:0%
of quicksand so we say if you have a
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
friend who is you know sinking in
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
quicksand um and we we get up and we
 
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
sort of role play you know what would
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
you do and so they all you know grab on
 
01:41:21.629 --> 01:41:21.639 align:start position:0%
and and the whole point of this activity
 
01:41:24.910 --> 01:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
in the end is that you know you learn
 
01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
that if just you by yourself are going
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
to help that person who is sinking in
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
quicksand you're going to get pulled
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
into so as you were talking about the
 
01:41:37.229 --> 01:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
young woman who at 3:00 in the morning
 
01:41:39.870 --> 01:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
has to help her friend it made me think
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
immediately of that quicksand analogy
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
where you alone are trying to help
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to be pulled into um so we
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
really teach the youth that there are
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
other resources that 988 people in the
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
school people in the community we teach
 
01:41:59.790 --> 01:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
them that you always look for a trusted
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
adult to help you in that situation we
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
teach them that 988 you can call if
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're not the one in crisis you as a
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
friend or you as a family member you can
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
call and say I have a concern about
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
somebody and I don't know what to do
 
01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
about it um so we teach them a lot of
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
different things so that they're whether
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's 3:00 am or whether it's 3 pm they
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
start to really think about the fact
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
that I don't have to do this by myself

trying to look at where the needs lie
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
what is working well what um could be
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
improved upon and what could inform
 
01:44:38.109 --> 01:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
policy in the future so uh continuing to
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%

information um I'm happy to answer any
 
01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions but we're just sort of

01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%

the department is working with um this
 
01:45:20.669 --> 01:45:20.679 align:start position:0%
vendor's contract was approved on May
 
01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
1st and we K had a kickoff meeting in um
 
01:45:30.189 --> 01:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
earlier this month on May 9th um this
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
included uh representation from the
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%

had the chair of the Commission on Aging
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%

um providing input um to this kickoff
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
meeting so uh the handout that I
 
01:46:11.589 --> 01:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
provided to you is really just an
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
overview of who our vendor is um and uh
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
the work that we plan on doing um over
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
the next few months uh in terms of of
 
01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
information gathering um doing a uh
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
survey and then working with um the
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
community including uh individuals who
 
01:46:38.589 --> 01:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
or family members with Alzheimer's
 
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
disease or related dementia providers
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
and others uh based on the outline of
 
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
the of the work that we need to do as
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
part of the legislation and the
 
01:46:48.119 --> 01:46:51.830 align:start position:0%
part of the legislation and the
appropriated

01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:54.189 --> 01:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
funds representative
 
01:46:58.990 --> 01:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
Edwards so I I barely remember hb2 but I
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
think I remember talking to you all and
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
as as I so I'm going to set this up and
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
have you correct me if I'm mistaken okay
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
I I I think what we did was that within
 
01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
DHHS there was a a public education
 
01:47:18.669 --> 01:47:18.679 align:start position:0%
function that I think reported into Miss
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
Tilly I it used to report into you right
 
01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
and and we set your program up as sort
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
of a parallel effort because we needed
 
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
these materials pretty badly and and
 
01:47:37.629 --> 01:47:37.639 align:start position:0%
that the existing Public Health
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
capability wanted the help and needed
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
the help so we set you up as an
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
independent project to really get this
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
done and my concern at the time was uh
 
01:47:51.629 --> 01:47:51.639 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and get that done but I'd
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
like to see in the next budget cycle the
 
01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
integration of the public health efforts
 
01:48:01.229 --> 01:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
and not replication of multiple Public
 
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
Health efforts throughout the department
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
could is if that if that sounds right to
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
you could you tell me where we're
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
trending towards making sure that in the
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
coming budget there's one Public Health
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
Organization on DHHS and that your
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
materials will become part of that
 
01:48:24.189 --> 01:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
unified effort
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
um certainly um within public health and
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
I I would defer to um associate
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner Tilly if she has something
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
to add to this um but we closely connect
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
with Public Health in terms of the work
 
01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
and products that they put out um in
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
terms of prevention and messaging so we
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
will be partnering with them now that
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
the we have a vendor and we will be
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
working with them um to develop those
 
01:48:55.149 --> 01:48:55.159 align:start position:0%
materials so in the long term we intend
 
01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
to streamline and um weave in whatever
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
um work um and messaging that we would
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
be doing in terms of brain health um
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's disease and related dementia
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:18.589 --> 01:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
campaign that that helps but M Mr chair
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
can can we get just get Miss Tilly to
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
respond to that I'm I'm would you
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
respond to that I'm I'm looking for um
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
the issue that that about whether or not
 
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
we're trending towards having a unified
 
01:49:33.790 --> 01:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
department and budget that does the
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mailu of materials that we
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
want sure so thank you so much again for
 
01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
the record Patricia Tilly ass
 
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner always happy to be here
 
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
always happy to be here with Wendy um so
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
what I would suggest is that we have
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
some work populationbased work that
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
happens in public health but the real
 
01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
bulk of it is really sitting within
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
Wendy's shop right now so we are you
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
know the way I would frame it is we are
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
working in partnership with this group
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
um because of the work that they're
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
doing across the board in aging and this
 
01:50:07.950 --> 01:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
fits best in that environment so again
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're malleable we know that the
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
resources are really within the Aging
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
plan and within the other work around
 
01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's and brain health we're here
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
to be supportive from a populationbased
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
level um to encourage that work and
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
ensure that whatever comes out of our
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
office is in alignment with them is
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
there anything you'd want to add to that
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
no great well follow follow up okay so I
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
I don't remember them all but the other
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
one that comes to mind is there was a
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
special initiative in Lyme disease a
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
while ago because we realized that we
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
were you know underpowered in what we
 
01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
were saying about Lyme disease and so
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just concerned about putting these
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
Pockets around the department and and
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
not having kind of a a a coordinated
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
unified approach to public messaging
 
01:50:58.589 --> 01:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
sure you know I I think that's always a
 
01:51:00.030 --> 01:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
you know the department is enormous as
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
we all know that it's got a thousand
 
01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
different moving parts and I actually
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
see that as the role of the leadership
 
01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:07.719 align:start position:0%
within the department you know certainly
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
under the guidance of the commissioner
 
01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
but also that's why you've got these
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
three associate Commissioners in who
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
have their finger in the pie in lots of
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
places and it's our job to make sure
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
that it all ties up and it coordinates
 
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of the
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
day so to answer your question there's
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
always going to be you know um I don't
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
expect Wendy alman's group to be you
 
01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
know the experts in Lyme disease um or
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
the impact on um brain health in that
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
but we bring our partnership to them and
 
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
we work together and we develop those
 
01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
relationships internally and also even
 
01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
among our external Partners as well to
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're in alignment that's
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
90% of the the work that myself and
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
other my colleagues do is to make sure
 
01:51:51.149 --> 01:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
that we're in alignment across the
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
department sometimes we miss things but
 
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
really that's what we're working towards
 
01:51:57.629 --> 01:51:57.639 align:start position:0%
is that we're getting messaging out um
 
01:51:59.709 --> 01:51:59.719 align:start position:0%
that the services are aligned and we've
 
01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:01.719 align:start position:0%
got the resources with the right skill
 
01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
sets thank you representative
 
01:52:07.229 --> 01:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
Merchant and thank you Mr chair and also
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question when I
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
look at the page two going down about
 
01:52:14.069 --> 01:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
the full launch and dissemination of
 
01:52:14.079 --> 01:52:15.750 align:start position:0%
the full launch and dissemination of
information

01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
to the community at large what I don't
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
see there is what I think is a
 
01:52:22.350 --> 01:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
relatively High touch point for a lot of
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
these patients is the pharmacy Community
 
01:52:28.109 --> 01:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
um I worked with a endocrinologist at
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
dmouth recently to help to launch a
 
01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
awareness campaign using Community
 
01:52:35.790 --> 01:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy as a way to get out bone health
 
01:52:37.149 --> 01:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
but I'm trying to get through why
 
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy because it's such a high touch
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
point the frequency and so forth of many
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:49.109 --> 01:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
included uh certainly uh we've only had
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
one uh kickoff meeting with our
 
01:52:54.510 --> 01:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group and they currently are
 
01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
providing feedback to um the onepage
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
summary that you see here as well as
 
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
some initial documents that are related
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
to um communicating out about the survey
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
um and who the survey needs to be
 
01:53:14.189 --> 01:53:14.199 align:start position:0%
targeted to so I certainly will take
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
that feedback uh back to our vendor um
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
and I do believe that uh individuals who
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
are part of the Alzheimer's disease and
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
related dementia subcommittee which is
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
meeting next Wednesday will have a
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
chance to we you know weigh in and
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
provide some feedback and we do have
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
somebody from um the medical society who
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
is um sitting on that subcommittee so we
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
will definitely be um engaging them in
 
01:53:47.069 --> 01:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
that discussion and they have a lot of
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
um connections and uh strategies that
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
will help make the campaign more robust
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
and I believe that that would include
 
01:54:00.589 --> 01:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
is part of your plan that there may be
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
some suggested legislation that we would
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
file this fall or not I'm not begging
 
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
for work but I'm just wondering
 
01:54:25.229 --> 01:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer that so certainly um
 
01:54:26.830 --> 01:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
part of the legislative charge of the
 
01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is to review all of these
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
various aspects of the States's response
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
um and the current landscape of
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's and other Dementia in the
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
state and based on that survey really to
 
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
if it's prudent come forward with
 
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
legislative uh suggestions based on
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
again what's working what exists is need
 
01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
and we do we are very fortunate to have
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lon and Senator avard um
 
01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
spearheading the committee um and C are
 
01:54:54.910 --> 01:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
very thoughtful about anything that
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
would be a good fit for legislation in
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
the future so there's no specific plan
 
01:55:01.149 --> 01:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
right now I won't speak for them none
 
01:55:03.149 --> 01:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
that has been communicated to me uh for
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
an initiative legislatively but that is
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
certainly Something That We're bearing
 
01:55:08.669 --> 01:55:08.679 align:start position:0%
in mind as we're getting this
 
01:55:12.069 --> 01:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
information I would beg you that when
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
legislators come to you or you go to
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
them about a bill to be filed have those
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
people coordinate with each other and
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
the reason is of the 75,000 bills that
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
were filed last
 
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
fall numbers of them were were so
 
01:55:32.589 --> 01:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
similar but we had a deal with them all
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
it would be much better if when you meet
 
01:55:39.870 --> 01:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
legislators who are hoping to help in
 
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
this you get them to coordinate with
 
01:55:44.589 --> 01:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
each other yes that would certainly be
 
01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
part of any strategy or conversation I
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
would be a part of absolutely thank you
 
01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
so much
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
yes saying nothing further thank thank
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%

01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
um I lost my program here but we will be
 
01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
meeting the fourth Friday of next month
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock and I'm going to key in to
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Weber's statement that

01:56:18.750 --> 01:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
