specifically about a portal and I know
 

00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:37.029 align:start position:0%
specifically about a portal and I know
we<00:29:35.600><c> had</c><00:29:35.760><c> talked</c><00:29:36.000><c> about</c><00:29:36.159><c> an</c><00:29:36.320><c> amendment</c><00:29:36.679><c> to</c><00:29:36.799><c> do</c>

and
um<00:32:41.600><c> I</c><00:32:41.760><c> guess</c><00:32:41.919><c> I</c><00:32:42.039><c> just</c><00:32:42.200><c> don't</c><00:32:42.399><c> think</c><00:32:42.519><c> it's</c>

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
um I guess I just don't think it's
 

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.669 align:start position:0%
um I guess I just don't think it's
necessary<00:32:43.360><c> so</c><00:32:43.519><c> I</c><00:32:43.639><c> would</c><00:32:43.799><c> support</c><00:32:44.120><c> an</c>

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
think they were looking for a problem
 

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.669 align:start position:0%
think they were looking for a problem
that<00:32:55.639><c> is</c><00:32:55.840><c> not</c><00:32:56.159><c> that</c><00:32:56.399><c> significant</c><00:32:57.200><c> there</c><00:32:57.440><c> may</c>

00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
that is not that significant there may
 

00:32:57.679 --> 00:33:00.269 align:start position:0%
that is not that significant there may

00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
be some issues with this but I think
 

00:33:00.279 --> 00:33:02.310 align:start position:0%
be some issues with this but I think
basically<00:33:00.840><c> if</c><00:33:01.120><c> my</c><00:33:01.320><c> child</c><00:33:01.600><c> is</c><00:33:01.799><c> having</c><00:33:02.080><c> some</c>

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
basically if my child is having some
 

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.230 align:start position:0%
basically if my child is having some
kind<00:33:02.440><c> of</c><00:33:02.600><c> a</c><00:33:02.799><c> medical</c><00:33:03.679><c> procedure</c><00:33:04.480><c> I</c><00:33:04.600><c> should</c>

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
kind of a medical procedure I should
 

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.070 align:start position:0%
kind of a medical procedure I should
just<00:33:05.440><c> have</c><00:33:05.760><c> access</c><00:33:06.120><c> to</c><00:33:06.440><c> that</c><00:33:07.200><c> okay</c><00:33:07.679><c> and</c><00:33:07.799><c> so</c><00:33:07.960><c> I</c>

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
just have access to that okay and so I
 

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.029 align:start position:0%
just have access to that okay and so I
think<00:33:08.279><c> that</c><00:33:08.440><c> this</c><00:33:08.600><c> is</c><00:33:08.799><c> kind</c><00:33:08.919><c> of</c><00:33:09.080><c> prohibitive</c>

00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
