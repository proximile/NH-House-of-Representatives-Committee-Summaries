00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
all right so I'd like to call to order
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee work session on House
 
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 406
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
FN um relative to parental access to
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
Children's Medical Records uh the
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of this subcommittee work
 
00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 align:start position:0%
session will be to make a recommendation
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
to the full health and human services in
 
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
Elder Affairs committee which will then
 
00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:05.879 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation on the bill to uh
 
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
to the house when it reconvenes in
 
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
January um
 
00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
so um I I guess I want to open by saying
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
I've had the benefit of of a number of
 
00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
conversations with um Hospital cios uh
 
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
risk and compliance officers PRI privacy
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
and compliance officers um at some of
 
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
the healthc care providers in um in New
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh learned a lot
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
throughout this process and really
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak to
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
those folks um as the prime sponsor of
 
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.670 align:start position:0%
those folks um as the prime sponsor of
this

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
bill it's important to me uh that
 
00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
we that we Empower parents and that we
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
get parents the information that they
 
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
need to um to to you know to be fully
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
informed about their their children's
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
health and well-being um having said
 
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
that I think we're also dealing with a
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
myriad of requirements both at the
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
federal and state level that make this a
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
much more complex issue than it appears
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
on the face of it um so um I I would
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
like to begin if I may by offering uh
 
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
just kind of a summary of what I've
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
learned throughout this process and and
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that will help to inform the
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee and in their
 
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts on where we go with this um
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
specifically uh the you know the the the
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
impetus for filing this bill arose from
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
a a parent who had received and many
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
parents have received a similar letter
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
um from one of the hospital systems in
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh saying that your child
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
is now aged 12 you will no longer have
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
access to their portal uh Records um and
 
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
this seemed to be a uh seemed to me and
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
to the parents in question uh to be be
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
kind of on an infringement on a parent
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
right to know what's happening with
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
their child um in
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
fact Hippa um dictates that parents do
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
have access to their children's me
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
medical records with certain
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
exceptions um those certain exceptions
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
might include things like um testing and
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
treatment for sexually transmitted
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
diseases among other things the same U
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
the same kinds of carve outs apply at
 
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
um in fact the
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
the the the ability to consent to
 
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
testing and
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
treatment for sexually transmitted
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
diseases is in New Hampshire statute um
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
for I'm pretty sure it's children e 16
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
and older um I may be wrong about that
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe 14 but I think it's 16 and
 
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
older and um and that also applies to
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
the privacy of those
 
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
records um that creates a bit of a
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
challenge for the uh for for the the
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
medical providers
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
because if they're going to provide
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
patient portal access they now need to
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
distinguish between that which is
 
00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
accessible to the patient versus that
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
which is accessible to the parent um
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
that means that their systems need to
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
accommodate this kind of Patchwork of um
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
various treatments medic ations and um
 
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
tests that might occur throughout the
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
the course of of caring for for that
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
patient um for
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
example um if a if a doctor if a if a
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
16-year-old comes in and says I think I
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
may have a sexually transmitted disease
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
I want to get tested
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
um the test and the treatment may have a
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
flag in the record that says this is to
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
be this is to remain
 
00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
private um the the the doctor or other
 
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
provider caring for that patient now
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
needs to check a box and make sure that
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
that is flagged as private from the
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
parents if they fail to do so it's a
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
compliance issue you know they they've
 
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
essentially violated the the privacy of
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
that of that minor
 
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.590 align:start position:0%
that of that minor
child

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
um and that was and and in the in the
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
conversation I had with a hospital C IO
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
the other day it was um it was possible
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
to flag the the
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
record um on treatment but not on
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
medication so there was no flag on
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
medication that the medication is to be
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
kept private
 
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
so ultimately there are there are
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
changes that need to happen at the
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
software level and the software um
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
typically we're talking about EMR EHR so
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh electronic medical records electronic
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
health records and these systems are
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
um as far as I know there are at least
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
eight different software vendors that
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
are in use in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh by various Hospital systems and
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
so they're they're they're not only
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
having to maintain those records they
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
also have portal software that then
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
needs to be able to
 
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
discern what to present to a parent
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
versus what to present to a child so
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
this puts the hospitals in a of All or
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
Nothing situation either we can present
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
everything or we can present nothing and
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
what they have chosen to do at this
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
point is to say starting at age 12 we're
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
going to present nothing to the parents
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
in order to comply with this Patchwork
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
of of uh privacy restrictions that are
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
in both fate federal and state
 
00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:51.069 align:start position:0%
in both fate federal and state
law

00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:51.079 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:53.670 align:start position:0%
law
um

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll stop there for a moment and
 
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
then I'll get into the information
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
blocking rule uh any questions or
 
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
comments so far yes
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
representative I should understand this
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
by now but it's I guess it just shows
 
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
how complicated it is um so you're
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
talking about the portal in particular
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
what information is available on the
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
portal but in in general in
 
00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:24.230 align:start position:0%
portal but in in general in
principle

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
principle
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
once I thought a minor was down to zero
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
but um I've just been informed that a
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
minor is 12 to
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
17 um and a child is younger than SE 12
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
um but in any case under federal law
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
under Hippa is it accurate to say
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
that a parent cannot access a 12 to 17
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
year old's records medical records
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
without consent from the
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
minor no that's not accurate it's um so
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
I was not trying to distinguish between
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
a child and a minor to me I was using
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
the terms interchangeably for anyone
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
under 18 um but the the distinction is
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
that they under Hippa a parent does have
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
the right to access their children's
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
medical records with certain exceptions
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
so if a if a parent goes to a a medical
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
provider and says I want a copy of my
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
child's Healthcare records They will get
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
them minus
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
certain things that are restricted so
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
okay that that was my previous
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
understanding but I guess maybe I
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
misunderstood something yeah and and the
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
that the EHR EMR systems and the portal
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
software that is used to make that
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
visible to to
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
patients is not able to
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
distinguish the you know what should be
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
excluded U for from a parent visibility
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
versus what should be
 
00:14:59.839 --> 00:15:02.069 align:start position:0%
versus what should be
included

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:03.829 align:start position:0%
included
um

00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
so the the other the other
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
um development that we were watching
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
when this bill was retained was what was
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
happening at the federal level with
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
something called the information
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
blocking Rule and the information
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
blocking rule um I believe emerged out
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
of the car's act and it basically says
 
00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759 align:start position:0%
that if a health care provider
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
has records that a patient is entitled
 
00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:30.829 align:start position:0%
has records that a patient is entitled
to

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
see and if the medical provider does
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
something let's say to make it more
 
00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
difficult to access those records that
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
would be a a viol a violation of HIPPA
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
or the spirit of HIPPA and so um so the
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
information blocking rule was when we
 
00:15:51.309 --> 00:15:51.319 align:start position:0%
rained this bill the information
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
blocking rule was still um sort of in
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
discussion how how will this look in
 
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
real life what are they going to
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
actually do um what will those
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
regulations look like there is a
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
specific carve out in what they have
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
implemented at the federal level
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the fact that there
 
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
are technical limitations currently in
 
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.230 align:start position:0%
are technical limitations currently in
the

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:13.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
software therefore the information
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
blocking rule has been deemed not to
 
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
apply currently to this situation that
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
is if if hospitals simply
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
say we're turn off parental access at
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
age 12 the the federal Regulators have
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
have acknowledged that the information
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
blocking rule will not apply uh will
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
will not prevent them from making that
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
decision because um there are technical
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
limitations which in essence compel them
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
them to make that
 
00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:50.839 align:start position:0%
decision but but once again just so I
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
have this straight when you say turning
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
off access at age 12 you're talking
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
about turning off access to the portals
 
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
not to the actual information itself
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
turning yes turning off information to
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
the portal so let's let's I I'll maybe
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
give an example which is um let's say
 
00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
you have a a 17-year-old who's going in
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
for um a routine
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
physical um or has you know breaks their
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
wrist or something like this and they're
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
going in for uh treatment and you around
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
the same time they go to a physician and
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
say hey I I I think I might have a
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted disease I'd like to
 
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.110 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted disease I'd like to
get

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
tested the law dictates that parents
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
have access to the child's medical
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
record but the test for an STD or any
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
subsequent treatment for the STD is not
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
included in that so um in order for the
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals to comply with the law they
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
either have to
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
provide they have to filter the
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
information that's visible to a parent
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
using the
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
portal which is not currently
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
technically feasible for them um short
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
of spending many millions of dollars on
 
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
custom coding or um they need to say
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
look you know if you want your child's
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
medical record you need to come in and
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
request it and we will provide it to you
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
and when they provide it they're going
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
to pull out those things that are deemed
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
to be private they're going to pull out
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.390 align:start position:0%
 
STDs

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
STDs
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions about what
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
I've said yes representative kushman
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I have a few issues with
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
this um so having had worked with some
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
of these big um EMR systems like epic um
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
I know for a fact that it's very
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
possible for them to have the these
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
systems changed to comply with rules um
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
I remember I think it was in 2020 maybe
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
2021 there were some rules coming down
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
by October everything had to be switched
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
over and our um the person at the um
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
visiting nursing agency that I was
 
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
working at who works with epic was busy
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
working with them and and working at The
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
Kinks and figuring out what changes
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
needed to be made and you know it was
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
just accepted and they worked on
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
changing the um the software to comply
 
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
with the rules that were coming down and
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
they had like three months to do it so I
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
I I I sympathize with you know that that
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
takes some work but I know that these
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
systems are have the staff and you know
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
that um it's totally possible to come
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
into compliance with a law once it's
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
been enacted or when it when they know
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be enacted soon um
 
00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:03.559 align:start position:0%
so uh I could reach out to that person
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
and get a little bit more information
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
from her I would like to see exactly
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
what that process was for when they had
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
to change um that stuff and maybe get
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
some feedback for um the next time we
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
discuss this or the full committee or
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
what have you um so that is a little
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
Troublesome and and then just still the
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
idea that parents either have to have
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
you know parents who want to see their
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
kids chart through the or see their kids
 
00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
information if the if the um hospital or
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know uh facility says um or doctor's
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
office says you know we're just going to
 
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
shut it off to you then that parent has
 
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
to go in person to and and get the
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
records in person and pay for the copies
 
00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
and I know that we discussed that
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
already I don't think that that's a fair
 
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
burden to put on parents cuz I had a
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
call from a mom of nine you know who
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to get into her daughter's chart
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
and they would not give her any access
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
and this was on blood work she wanted to
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
know simple Labs what the labs results
 
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
were and the policy of the um doctor's
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
office was just no we don't allow you in
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
and then um I was also looking I I was
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
investigating this last night and you
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
know they've they've done um some
 
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:24.279 align:start position:0%
studies on these these emrs and over 50%
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
of them allow for pro proxy access um so
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's like deliberately designed to give
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
parents just the information that
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to over 50% of them
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
have that capability already so I just
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
don't see how it's so difficult maybe we
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
can push the the enactment date back to
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
give them some time to comply but um as
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
far as I see it you know saying oh we
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the technical ability and
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
just throwing their hands up it seems
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
like um it seems
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
like there's a lot more to it than that
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
and that it is possible maybe they just
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
need a little bit more time but that's
 
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
questions does any do any of our subject
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
matter experts in the room have anything
 
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
they'd like to
 
00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:26.950 align:start position:0%
they'd like to
add

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:35.750 align:start position:0%
add
yes

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um and members of the
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
committee for the record po inan senior
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
vice president state government
 
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
relations for the New Hampshire Hospital
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
Association I don't consider myself a an
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
expert but um I do represent the
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals and I have been um talking
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
with our our members for um months on
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
this so I appreciate representative
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
kushman um all all your excuse me
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt um as far as your
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
um um research that you have done in the
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
um willingness to talk with some of the
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
hospital um folks that has um I think
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
been very helpful certainly um the
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals have appreciated that as as
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
have I um I think um it is very
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
complicated um different systems um as
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
representative kushman mentioned epic is
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
a different system a very very expensive
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
system and not everyone has that um and
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
their capabilities are different than a
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
CNA versus a metatech or whatever else
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
um so that is one of the challenges um
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
and um they are all working towards this
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
but they are just not there yet um
 
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
relative to the portal and I I think I I
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
think I just need to um caution everyone
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
the EMR is not the portal and I think a
 
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
lot of people conflate the two um and
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
access to the miners medical record
 
00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
through um the appropriate consents when
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
necessary are certainly um allowable
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
doable um happens all all the time um
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
and I think I have shared with the
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
committee through representative kofalt
 
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
some of the um uh documentation for for
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
doing just that it's the portal that I
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
think is just the issue that has um I
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
think been has come up during this whole
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
debate and I think pres kofalt has
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
explained it very well as far as it's an
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
extraction of the EMR and trying to pull
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
um without violating Hippa which would
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
be a federal um um problem um and
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
compliance is very very strict about
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
this um the chances of the flags we're
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
talking about human humans um putting
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
flags on and trying to make sure that
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
that data does not get over to the
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
portal inappropriately is is a big heavy
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
lift um and I um appreciate
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
representative kushman your comments but
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
um again epic is one system and not even
 
00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
everyone that's on Epic has the same
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
capabilities because it is a lot of work
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and um the so what some hospitals
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
have done is actually shut off the
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
portal once the the patient turns 12 so
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
that they do not violate um Federal
 
00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
HIPPA laws so um that so I just want to
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
mention that
 
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
um what we um certainly I think what has
 
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
come out of all of this is more
 
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
education I think which doesn't require
 
00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:38.919 align:start position:0%
legislation um there is certainly always
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to um provide CL more
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
clarity to parents and to patients um in
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
general um and I think that is something
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
that we have taken back and will take
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
back and have further discussion
 
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
certainly with our hospitals relative to
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
what can be provided in uh Pediatric
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
rian's office in the hospitals um uh
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
offices um not just pediatricians but
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
family docs as well um so that it's very
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
clear what um the parents rights are and
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
what the patient's rights as a minor
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
child also are um so I just wanted to to
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
mention that as well but um again we we
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
cannot support this bill um because of
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
all the challenges and um um issues that
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
would be um um imposed if essentially
 
00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
the hospitals um would not be able to to
 
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
meet these requirements um due to um
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
their the techn technological
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
limitations so what I think Could Happen
 
00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
um is the portals would just get shut
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
off um and that's not good um the
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
portals I think are a great tool for
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
communicating with the provider with
 
00:26:56.909 --> 00:26:56.919 align:start position:0%
setting up um uh appointments and um and
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
accessing all sorts of information
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
people really seem to like the portals
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
um but that that I'm afraid could be an
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence and that would be
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
really unfortunate so happy to answer
 
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your perspective
 
00:27:17.389 --> 00:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um yeah I just I guess I want
 
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
to comment on that last uh statement
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
which is um there are sometimes un
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
unintended con consequences to adding
 
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
requirements um
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
in New York City a number of years ago
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
for example um the the city passed an
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
ordinance that all swimming pools had to
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
have a um a lift for people with
 
00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:41.519 align:start position:0%
disabilities to get in and out of the
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
pool um that was very costly ultimately
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
for hotels that had a swimming pool a
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
lot of those uh hotels simply decided to
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
close their swimming pool so uh there
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
are and and I'm not saying that's
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily what would happen here
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
um I ultimately think that this does
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
need to get resolved um I think that um
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
if we don't do it in a way that
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
is manageable and realistic then um you
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
know it could have unintended
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
consequences or it could prompt some
 
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
smaller providers to Simply go the route
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
of turning off P patient portals
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
altogether which I think would be a net
 
00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:28.519 align:start position:0%
loss so um you know my my intention is
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
that you know I would like to see this
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
get resolved eventually um I I'm not um
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
in in my my comments I think are um are
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
if I hadn't said so already you know I I
 
00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think that this bill is ready to
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
go to the floor for a vote in its
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
current form um having said that I I
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
think that it is an issue that we ought
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
to keep the pressure on um and and
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
hopefully see if if it can be resolved
 
00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
at the federal level it if it can't be
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
resolved at the federal level then um
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
State legislation may be in order I just
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
don't personally feel like we're quite
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
there yet so um to me that suggests
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
either an itl or an interim study uh
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
motion but uh you know we'll have to see
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
what the other members of this working
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh committee subcommittee think about
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
that so um yes representative kosman
 
00:29:31.149 --> 00:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
thank you so reading over the bill again
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
I don't see that it says anything
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
specifically about a portal and I know
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
we had talked about an amendment to do
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
that so um right now it looks like this
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
is just in line with the federal law
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
because it just says release of the
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
records to a parent or guardian and then
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
it has the carats for specific state or
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
federal laws or if there's a reason to
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
believe it may endanger the welfare of
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
the child um or if the parent agrees to
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
there being confidential communication
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
so the bill as it stands um it doesn't
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
really address that and I think it would
 
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
just I what it looks like to me is that
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
it would put in our state law a
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee that a parent can access their
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
child's record and whether that's in
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
paper or the
 
00:30:15.389 --> 00:30:15.399 align:start position:0%
portal the way it's written now it's
 
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
really up to who's providing the record
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
to the parent um unless a parent asks
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
specifically for paper you know what I
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
mean do you understand what I'm saying
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
like it doesn't say it just says that
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
they need access to the
 
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
record so under Hippa they already have
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
that so if the parent asks um you know
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
their child's doctor for that
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
information um and the the doctor's
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
office uses a um patient portal that
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to let the
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
parent in um without hiding that
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
sensitive information then they have to
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
furnish a paper copy of the record um
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
but that's what it looks like your bill
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
does right now now just you know
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
enshrines that in state law I just
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that comment that's all I
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what that means for the
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
outcome of this subcommittee but just
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention it okay representative
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
Shapiro thank you
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
um you know aside from all of the
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
technical challenges in terms of the
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
portals and electronic medical records
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
which seem to be significant enough to
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
um to be cautious about passing a bill
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
like this um I'm also concerned that
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
um we're waiting into something that's
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
just not necessary that
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
um that Hippa already
 
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.389 align:start position:0%
um that Hippa already
outlines

00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
outlines
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
um what parents have access what
 
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
guardians or parents have access to in
 
00:31:51.149 --> 00:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
terms of medical
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
information and
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
um we're coming at this bill initially
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
from from a place of assuming that
 
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
there's a significant problem because of
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
an anecdotal letter
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
from I shouldn't say a real letter from
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
a hospital that was maybe more
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
complicated than we thought it was at
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
first um because when I heard you read
 
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
that I thought it was denying parents
 
00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.269 align:start position:0%
that I thought it was denying parents
access

00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
um and so I would also say that
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
um I just don't think this is necessary
 
00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:30.519 align:start position:0%
and we're kind of waiting into a a
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
battle where one side assumes that uh
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
medical providers are keeping
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
information from families
 
00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:40.590 align:start position:0%
information from families
and

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
um I guess I just don't think it's
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
necessary so I would support an
 
00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:48.990 align:start position:0%
necessary so I would support an
itl

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
okay yes I I agree I support an itl I
 
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
think they were looking for a problem
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
that is not that significant there may
 
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
be some issues with this but I think
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
basically if my child is having some
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
kind of a medical procedure I should
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
just have access to that okay and so I
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
think that this is kind of prohibitive
 
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
in my access to things
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
that so thank you I um
 
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
so you know my my own comment about sort
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
of is there a problem is I believe that
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
there is a problem for multiple reasons
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
one is that it's it's somewhat alarming
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
for a parent to receive that letter um
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
and it's not just one hospital system
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
that's doing it it's you know I I I have
 
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
suggested that you know perhaps some
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
further explanation of why this is being
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
done uh may help to alleviate some of
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
that alarm because it it it seems that
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
um the medical providers are kind of
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
being in put in a position where they
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
have to be the bad guy and that's
 
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
actually not the way I see it now uh the
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
way I see it now is that they're subject
 
00:33:58.629 --> 00:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
to regulation which kind of put them in
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
a no in situation um I would like to see
 
00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:03.389 align:start position:0%
a no in situation um I would like to see
this

00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
resolved um I would you know whether we
 
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
do itl or or interim study or whether
 
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
someone proposes an amendment to the
 
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
full committee I would like to
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately see this move forward my
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
sense is that um there
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
is the ideal place for it to move
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
forward is at the federal level
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
or at the you know at the software
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
companies that are that are doing this
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't see them necessarily
 
00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:31.960 align:start position:0%
investing that until somebody tells them
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
they have to um so I guess my my
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
inclination is to say you know I I don't
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
want to let this issue die um but I it
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
it occurs to me that the the bill this
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
may not be the right time for the bill
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
and certainly the um the short time
 
00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
frame for implementation is just not
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
point

00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative I lost my question
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
but my question has to do with having
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
this resolve studying us and trying to
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
to change are we able to do that or we
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
better to just itl and start new with a
 
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.109 align:start position:0%
better to just itl and start new with a
new

00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
proposals you know per personally that's
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
what I would intend to do um if if this
 
00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.430 align:start position:0%
what I would intend to do um if if this
gets

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
itls any further discussion
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative kushman just um just
 
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
to like kind of tie up the the ends of
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
what I was saying um so that
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
parent um she has nine children she had
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
to she went to look up the labs she
 
00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:44.839 align:start position:0%
couldn't see them that her daughter had
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
had just routine Labs but she um wanted
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
to know what the results were she called
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
the doctor's office they said no she's
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
12 you don't have access to her portal
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
anymore if you want the records you have
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
to come in in person and get them on
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
paper so that's that would comply with
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
this law um or this bill and it complies
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
with HIPPA
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
um however um I called that office and
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
discussed it with their office manager
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
and shortly thereafter the parent had
 
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
access to the record um so I think it's
 
00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.950 align:start position:0%
access to the record um so I think it's
very

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
possible if we hold people's feet to the
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
fire to respect parentals right parental
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
rights and that you know it can be done
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
um I understand that there are
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
definitely technical challenges and that
 
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
that's going to take some time um
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
because this doesn't really specifically
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
address the portal issue and it just
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
basically restates Hippa I'm comfortable
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
with an itl okay um and I and I support
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
um bringing another bill back you know
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
watching this issue seeing what happens
 
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
and if necessary bringing a bill back
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
right yes we have a motion
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative Fus representative fedus
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%

I would just like to say this a you know
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about medical records
 
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
there's a great variation of information
 
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.190 align:start position:0%
there's a great variation of information
and

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
um I would be frustrated if I was a
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
parent and I was not able if there was a
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
real barrier put in front of me in terms
 
00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
of getting lab tests for uh how old she
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
was 13 13 year old um on the other hand
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
um in my career as a mental health
 
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.870 align:start position:0%
um in my career as a mental health
clinician

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
clinician
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I I I passionately believed
 
00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
in informed consent and parent parental
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
involvement I thought of myself as a
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
family um therapist um and yet at the
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
same time there were often delicate
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
issues that were
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
um were were were were're providing
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
information um was incredibly delicate
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
and um I I was glad to be able to have
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
some control of how that information was
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
um shared and I spent you
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
know infrequently with with not very
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
many people but throughout my career
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time hours with parents
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
going over their medical records in my
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
office uh their their children's medical
 
00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
records in my office um you know Page by
 
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
page because I thought if that could be
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
avoided it was probably better
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
but um when it was necessary it was
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
really important to do and um so I guess
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that um while I voted
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
to itl I'm I'm a believer that parents
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
um should be involved um to get the best
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
