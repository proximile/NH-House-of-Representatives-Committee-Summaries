open the hearing on House Bill 182
 
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
members of the labor committee
 
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
um this bill is very similar to a bill
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
that was passed
 
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 align:start position:0%
last year by the house uh on a Voice
 
00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.170 align:start position:0%
last year by the house uh on a Voice
vote

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 align:start position:0%
and I'm reintroducing it for some reason
 
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
it died in the Senate I have not been
 
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
able to find out why
 
00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 align:start position:0%
but it is also part of the ad hoc study
 
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
on Recruitment and Retention that was uh
 
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
formed by commissioner Quinn last year
 
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 align:start position:0%
and what we can do to help
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain volunteer
 
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.629 align:start position:0%
recruit and retain volunteer
firefighters

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
and volunteer EMS people
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
volunteers are at the heart and soul of
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
many of our communities
 
00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 align:start position:0%
and anything that we can do to make it
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
better for them it's better for our
 
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.570 align:start position:0%
better for them it's better for our
communities

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
it saves our communities money
 
00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 align:start position:0%
and it provides a cohesive building of
 
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
the community
 
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to talk long on it the
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
bill is very simple
 
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.129 align:start position:0%
bill is very simple
um

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
it prohibits
 
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
harassment for a firefighter or a
 
00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 align:start position:0%
volunteer EMS person who leaves work
 
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
there is a similar provision in 153 a17
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
that allows volunteer EMS people to be
 
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
late for work and cannot be reprimanded
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
not exactly the same but very very
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
similar and that's been on the books
 
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.450 align:start position:0%
similar and that's been on the books
so

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm saying is
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
we anything that we can do
 
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
to improve the Recruitment and Retention
 
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
of volunteer fireman firefighters be
 
00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 align:start position:0%
careful and EMS Personnel would be very
 
00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 align:start position:0%
beneficial not only to those individuals
 
00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 align:start position:0%
but to the community at large I know
 
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 align:start position:0%
when our neighboring town of Sunapee
 
00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 align:start position:0%
they're looking to put on two full-time
 
00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.610 align:start position:0%
they're looking to put on two full-time
people

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
and that cost is going to be
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
north of 150 to 175 thousand dollars
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to just leave it on some
 
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
simple things on here somebody asked me
 
00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
about statistics how often do we have
 
00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:37.189 align:start position:0%
about statistics how often do we have
problems

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
it's not the type of thing that somebody
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
files a complaint if they've been
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
harassed because if they're being
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
harassed they don't want to get harassed
 
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
anymore by their supervisor so there
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
aren't a lot of
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
um statistics out there to say this
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
somebody spoke to me
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
recently and suggested that this would
 
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
be part of a trial period and I'd be
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
willing to accept an amendment to Sunset
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
this after three or four years
 
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
to see whether it does help recruitment
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
and retention
 
00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:18.139 align:start position:0%
with that I'm here to answer questions
 
00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 align:start position:0%
and hope that you will take 182
 
00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
I have one for you what is the standard
 
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
protocol right now or most employers
 
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
when it comes to volunteer fire and EMS
 
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
do they
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
um because you have here that no such
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
employer shall be required to compensate
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
any employee for the period is that
 
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
pretty much what happens right now
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
um they're just no not paid for those
 
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
hours most of them are paid for those
 
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060 align:start position:0%
hours that I know of again there's not a
 
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
lot of statistics on it but I know uh
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
one of our bigger employers Storm Ruger
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
they uh
 
00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
they compensate their people
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay next question
 
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.430 align:start position:0%
okay next question
um

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
if I might have a follow-up Mr Bush here
 
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
um approximately how many volunteer
 
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
firefighters do you believe there are in
 
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.140 align:start position:0%

it was a commission that was put
 
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
together by commissioner Quinn of the
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety it had
 
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:54.740 align:start position:0%
11 or 12 members throughout the state
 
00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
and they came up with a whole series of
 
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
findings and recommendations
 
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
I will get that to you and and that bill
 
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:06.899 align:start position:0%

and you said you would be agreeable to a
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
two-year sunset

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
want to go through a whole budgeting
 
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
career but whatever works for your
 
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
career but whatever works for your
committee

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee

um we're looking at that on the uh same
 
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:30.860 align:start position:0%
problem we have over at the fire academy
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
is getting
 
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.610 align:start position:0%
is getting
um

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
instructors and retired instructors who
 
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
are the best type to have and they're
 
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
having problems with the uh retirement
 
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
fund so we're putting a three-year
 
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.530 align:start position:0%
fund so we're putting a three-year

of Manchester and there is currently a
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%

the Academy relative to the future of
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
the employment picture for firefighters
 
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh in general uh as we're going to say
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
so I think a tough time recruiting
 
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
firefighters in general
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%

president of the New Hampshire State
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
Firemen's Association uh we're the
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
oldest Firemen's Association in the
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
state we're actually enacted by the
 
00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:37.019 align:start position:0%
general legislature back in 1899 a few
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
years ago we support House Bill 182. uh
 
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
I've been a firefighter volunteer
 
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
firefighter since 1977. I'm still active
 
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
EMT firefighter on Bedford fire
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
department one of the few call Personnel
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
are still left but we support this
 
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
because we're really interested in the
 
00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
recruitment retention issues with the
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
state we're actively working with the
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
recruitment retention program that was
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
put together by commissioner Quinn we
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
have Representatives on that board as
 
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
well our objective is to make sure that
 
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
we can recruit and retain it's a
 
00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:13.139 align:start position:0%
national not a national crisis but it's
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
a sliding scale on people volunteering
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
for fire departments and when you get
 
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
North on a notch most of the Departments
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
are volunteering call we don't have
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
people banging on the doors to get into
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
the fire departments the career
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
departments have a very short list of
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
firefighters who are coming to the
 
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
Firehouse so we're trying to recruit and
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
retain not only career but also call
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
volunteer with a small Department if
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
there's maybe eight ten firefighters on
 
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
the department now to to run a a call is
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
very difficult whereas 20 30 years ago
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
there was 30 or 40 firefighters on a
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
fire department on the volunteer
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
department so we find this bill is
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
important to give as much ammunition to
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
our volunteer and call Firefighters that
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
they respond to a call an emergency if
 
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
it's late at night three in the morning
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
they say well I got to get up and got to
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
get to work by six o'clock or I'm going
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
to not have a good time at work we don't
 
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
want to have them have that fear if they
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
can have a little bit of insurance so to
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
speak that they have that the state has
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
their back that the business has their
 
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
back that they're not going to be just
 
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
discipline for showing up an hour too
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
late to help out their Community to help
 
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
out their calendars times have changed
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
businesses have changed businesses
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
aren't local to the community so they
 
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
may not understand so we'd like to give
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
our volunteers and call Firefighters as
 
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.230 align:start position:0%
our volunteers and call Firefighters as
much

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
relief as possible it may not sound like
 
00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:41.459 align:start position:0%
much there may not be a lot of
 
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
disciplines but it only takes one and we
 
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we support our
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters to answer some questions if
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
you're looking for the Recruitment and
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
Retention information if you go to our
 
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.750 align:start position:0%
Retention information if you go to our
website

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
nhsfa.org we have it on our website you
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
can download it uh it's a it's a good
 
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.670 align:start position:0%
can download it uh it's a it's a good
program

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
also for the amount of firefighters we
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
believe there's over 5 000 firefighters
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
in the state 1500 of which are career so
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
that would leave uh about 3 500
 
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
volunteer on-call firefighters we're
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
trying to get those numbers a little
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
more accurate by having people uh Fire
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
Chiefs submit their information each
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
year but that's about the number we have
 
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
it's about a drastic change from about
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
10 years ago where we had over 7 000
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
firefighters in the state so people
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
aren't volunteering like they used to
 
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
and some of these they go to Pittsburgh
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
you go to Freedom you go all over the
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
state north of the Notch and or north of
 
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
the lakes and there's not as many
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
volunteer on-call firefighters we're
 
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
trying to do as much as we can for the
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
communities because these are your homes
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
and your your towns and your roadways
 
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Green
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
Mr Vice chairman thank you Mr chairman
 
00:15:58.009 --> 00:15:58.019 align:start position:0%
when this bill was before us last year I
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
had sitting to my right a representative
 
00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
who flies an airplane for a living
 
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
and I asked him what would happen if he
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
had a flight at 9am and he called and he
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
said you know what I'm not going to make
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
it I need to hold that flight a couple
 
00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:14.030 align:start position:0%
it I need to hold that flight a couple
hours

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't work for him and isn't that
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
the case that there are some
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
employers who are very accommodating to
 
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters and other
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
employers where the model really just
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
00:16:31.689 --> 00:16:31.699 align:start position:0%
and does a one-size-fits all law
 
00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:34.019 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
will that cause a problem for certain
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
types of employment
 
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.650 align:start position:0%
types of employment
well

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
I think that would be based upon a
 
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
choice of the individual if they chose
 
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
not to go because they have a doctor has
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
a surgery a pilot has a flight that's
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
their choice not to go but if they're
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
out on a call and they show up late to
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
work I mean you know if they if they
 
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:58.980 align:start position:0%
have to leave the call they leave the
 
00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:01.019 align:start position:0%
call that's up to them that's a as the
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
firefighter but if they show up to work
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
and they're late and they get
 
00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:05.770 align:start position:0%
and they're late and they get
disciplined

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:05.780 align:start position:0%
disciplined
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
we're just looking to support our
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
Personnel not penalize the business
 
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question
 
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
origin of attitude thank you Mr chairman
 
00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
um following up on the previous question
 
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
um in the hypothetical that you laid out
 
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
if a fire happens at 3am
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
and a volunteer firefighter is called
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
and they say well you know I have work
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
in the morning I can't really get up
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
there the fire is not going to wait
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
either correct that is true thank you
 
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Green uh
 
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
so I was a Manchester firefighter you're
 
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
in Bedford so thank you for your service
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
yeah make sure you know where my house
 
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
is in case you're doing mutually we're
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
second to there yeah you're right on the
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
right on the line uh that's that aside
 
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
can you just describe uh the commitment
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
that a warranty of firefighter has to
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
make uh to even get to the point where
 
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
he is a certified uh firefighter uh and
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh because that's a significant
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
commitment now can you just describe
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
what that takes to get there it's 120
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
hours to get your level one uh and then
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh continued there's a lot of
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
firefighters who continue on for vehicle
 
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
extrication and and if you want to go
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
for EMS there's another 120 uh 120 hours
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
for EMS and then 24 hours each uh two
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
years for uh continue education so to
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
get a five in you know back in the horse
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
and buggy days and I started was a whole
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
lot different but now we've made sure
 
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:39.299 align:start position:0%
that our firefighters are safe we've
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
added a larger curriculum uh we're also
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that that it works
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
well for the volunteers trying to do a
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
little more online training with the
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
states they don't have to drive two
 
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
hours to get three hours of training two
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
hours back home to spend to go to work
 
00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
the next day so there is a huge uh
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
commitment by the volunteers to to be a
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
certified firefighter if they just want
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
to go for level one then they go to
 
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
Green for taking my question I'm
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
thinking about an earlier question about
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
for a person whose employment situation
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't isn't really appropriate for
 
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
being able to become in late or to
 
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
volunteer isn't that more incumbent upon
 
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
that person to make a decision whether
 
00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:33.539 align:start position:0%
or not they should enter take this
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
so that so that if I were a a doctor and
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
I know that I often have surgeries at
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock in the morning this isn't
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
or or two o'clock in the afternoon in
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
the evening this isn't my this isn't
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
what for me
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
I think that's a personal choice
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
um you know everyone has their personal
 
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
choice you know we're not asking
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
everybody in town to be on a volunteer
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
fire department uh you know that's a
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's something that's in in you I mean I
 
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
wanted to be a firefighter since I was
 
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
three years old and I was you know most
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
of us who are on the fire department
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
want to be since we're we're little kids
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
but it's something that we I've always
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
enjoyed giving back to my community uh
 
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
that's what it's been for me everybody
 
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
has a different uh thing but uh you know
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
if you have a position an occupation a
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
profession where you can't leave in the
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
middle of night and you have to be there
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's your choice that's your decision
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
but I think what this bill is looking
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
toward is the the
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
people who are there serving their
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
Community if they come in an hour late
 
00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
to their work because they're out on a
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
on an all-nighter uh that they aren't
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
penalized I mean they may not get paid
 
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
for it and that's fine I'm sure there's
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of hours I didn't get paid because
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
I showed up late but that was a choice
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
by me
 
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
thank you and and so again this is for
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
the this is for the people who can do
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
this that we're not to worry about the
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
people whose jobs aren't suitable for
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
this only those who desire to and can
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
many additional questions
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Green we spoke before the hearing and
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
I think it's important here for the
 
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.710 align:start position:0%
I think it's important here for the
record

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
what information do you have
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
that you could give this committee
 
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.090 align:start position:0%
that you could give this committee
about

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
employers who have reprimanded or
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
discharged employees
 
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.270 align:start position:0%
discharged employees
or

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know doing their duty to go to a
 
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
fire or or such I I do personally do not
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
have any documentation I know that it's
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
been experienced over the years we had
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
one of our firefighters who worked for a
 
00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:51.419 align:start position:0%
company with a family business and he
 
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
was told you got to decide you're going
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
to be a firefighter you're going to be
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
working in this business but you just
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
can't leave all the time or show up late
 
00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
whenever you want that person had to
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
make that decision whether they were
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
going to be working in that business or
 
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
volunteering for the fire department
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
so those there's nothing documentation
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
on that that was just a conversation
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
that we had had that was experienced as
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
I told you I grew up in Amherst it was
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
all volunteer fire department a lot of
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
my business friends were firefighters
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
and such
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
but we have a situation where you just
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
mentioned you had an employer who
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
decided that they had to let someone go
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
because they could not have someone like
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
that that would come and go or not be
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
able to show up so where do we have this
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
this we have this fine line here between
 
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
needing volunteer firefighters to be
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
able to do the job that is needed and
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
telling employers they can't discipline
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
someone if they can't show up to work
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
that is the the the
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
difficulty that we have here so I would
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
How would
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
you how do we address this the best of
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
your knowledge how do we address this
 
00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
while trying to do what we need to do to
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
help the citizens have firefighters but
 
00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:12.539 align:start position:0%
dealing with employers
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
I think looking at other states seeing
 
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:18.020 align:start position:0%
if other states have this same structure
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh the firefighter in question in my my
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
analogy was not fired he had to make a
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
decision uh whether he was going to run
 
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of calls or you know back off uh
 
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
but I think it's uh it's important that
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
those in the fire service serving their
 
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
communities have as much protections as
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
possible it's not telling the business
 
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
what to do or how to do but if
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
firefighter shows up an hour too late
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
for work because they're giving back to
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
the community I think they should be
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
afforded some protections
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
the employer doesn't have to pay them
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
you have to run an hourly scale I
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect an employer to pay them
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative attitude thank you Mr
 
00:23:59.210 --> 00:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
00:23:59.220 --> 00:23:59.870 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
um

00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
if I told you that uh many state
 
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
legislators who are also volunteer have
 
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
experienced similar uh Do or Die
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
situations where they've had to make a
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
choice between uh being here and keeping
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
their job would that surprise you
 
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:19.860 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I've run that past me again if
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
I told you that many volunteer state
 
00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:24.500 align:start position:0%
legislators have experienced the same
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
anecdotal situations that many of the
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters have would that
 
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
surprise you
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
no it wouldn't follow up
 
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that volunteer
 
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
firefighters are probably more important
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
to continue to have do their volunteer
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
I think that's a trap
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
I agree Amendment I'll refer to not
 
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
answer that question if I'm allowed I
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
think my point was established
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative attitude any
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
being done thank you Mr Green thank you
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%

I have the wrong bill that Mr McAllister
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
would like to um
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh he wants to testify this afternoon it
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:29.690 align:start position:0%
is 10 25. I have no additional pink
cards

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none we're going to have Mike
 
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.149 align:start position:0%
seeing none we're going to have Mike
Cahill

00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
Cahill
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh give us a lesson in and how to use
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:43.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
actually I've got another idea could I
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh meet with the Democrats in the office
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%

closed
 
00:25:59.149 --> 00:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
trying to deprive us of percussion
 
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
if you got the phone yeah oh I got it I
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%

firing of any state representatives or
 
00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:18.789 align:start position:0%

saying

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's abusing them
 
00:26:29.880 --> 00:46:40.510 align:start position:0%
it's abusing them
and

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%

00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
turcott from Stratford County District 4
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
which is uh now the towns of Barrington
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
and Stratford I'm currently in my fourth
 
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
term here and as uh chairman infantine
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
said I mean now uh chairman over on the
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
municipal and County government I did
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
serve three terms here in labor as well
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
as on finance redistricting
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
and a few other things I'm here to
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill 190. on behalf of
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
myself and some other members of
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
some chairs and vice chairs as well as
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
the bill this year HB 190 is almost a
 
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
carbon copy of last year's HB
 
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
1337. last year this bill passed in the
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives not once but
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
twice it passed on the house floor with
 
00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
only by a vote of 179 and 153 with all
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
but three Republicans voting for it with
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
one Democrat who actually voted in favor
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
with us it was later brought forward as
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
a floor Amendment during a committee a
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
conference we attached it to a
 
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
a Senate bill and
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
it all died
 
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.170 align:start position:0%
it all died
so

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
when the bill last year went over to the
 
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
Senate they did what the Senate does
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
quite often and that is they don't like
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
us sending them too many bills so they
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
mix a lot of them and this was one that
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
they mixed
 
00:49:28.079 --> 00:49:29.809 align:start position:0%
they mixed
um

00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it's a common sense
 
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
approach and a rational tool which does
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
several things one it incentivizes the
 
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
work ethic it will strengthen the
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
state's trust fund it will reduce the
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance taxes that
 
00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
businesses pay allowing the businesses
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
to use that savings for a number of
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
things better pay maybe maybe better
 
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
benefits or even expanding their
 
00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:59.569 align:start position:0%
benefits or even expanding their
businesses

00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:02.089 --> 00:50:02.099 align:start position:0%
um currently this has this approach has
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
been taken in I think we're up to 10 or
 
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
11 states now with a universally
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
positive results some states better than
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
others uh what I will give you at the
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
end of this hearing is
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
um a white paper by the foundation for
 
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
government accountability that talks
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
so the mechanics of the bill how it
 
00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:29.150 align:start position:0%
so the mechanics of the bill how it
works

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
basically it initially reduces the
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
maximum number of weeks from 26 down to
 
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
24. currently we're at a half year
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
and it reduces at that 24 weeks it pegs
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
it to the unemployment rate in the state
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
this is the whole idea of the bill when
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
you in index the unemployment rate to
 
00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
how long unemployed many weeks of
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment the individual can get so
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
at 24 weeks you would get that anytime
 
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate is eight percent
 
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
or greater now that number reduces by a
 
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
half percent
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
reduces by one week for one for each one
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
half a percent the unemployment rate
 
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
goes down to a low of three percent
 
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
where the benefit would be at 14 weeks
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
currently as you know in the state of
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're below that three
 
00:51:31.809 --> 00:51:31.819 align:start position:0%
percent so
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
today that number would be eligible for
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
the individual would be eligible for 14
 
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh some of the other points in the bills
 
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
worked with the Deputy Commissioner
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
lavers last year on as we went through
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
this bill a couple of the issues that
 
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
came up or what happens
 
00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
when you have a pandemic like we did
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
with the coronavirus or the 2008
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
economic crisis and in both situations
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
there the federal government's stepped
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
in but you'll also note in the bill
 
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
there's an R it mentions RSA for uh
 
00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
colon 4 45 and what that is is the state
 
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
of emergency exception so in a state of
 
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
emergency if the governor declared he
 
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
could basically alter the the length of
 
00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:29.170 align:start position:0%
could basically alter the the length of
time

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:29.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
also the uh the date at which the the
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
numbers taken the unemployment rate is
 
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
the fourth quarter uh again that was
 
00:52:42.049 --> 00:52:42.059 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:42.770 align:start position:0%
based on
um

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
discussions with represent uh with
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner labors
 
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.390 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner labors
so

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
the longer individuals are unemployed
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
the more likely they are to fall into
 
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
long-term dependency or the frequency of
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
dependency and the harder it is to find
 
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
work at that point the studies of
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
numerous Studies have shown that
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
receiving these benefits for an extended
 
00:53:13.569 --> 00:53:13.579 align:start position:0%
amount of time can reduce unemployment
 
00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:16.220 align:start position:0%
unemployed workers job search efforts
 
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
I think the recent covid
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
pandemic of over the last couple years
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
has been an ex
 
00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
perfect example of what can happen
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
businesses can't find workers because
 
00:53:35.569 --> 00:53:35.579 align:start position:0%
people have gotten too too familiar with
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
being out on the sidelines I recall
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
specifically spring of 2021 last two
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.339 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic Governor sununu
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
initially wanted to continue the there
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
was a 300 extra amount that the
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
government was providing to the
 
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
unemployed and he was going to extend
 
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
that and quickly our businesses in New
 
00:53:59.930 --> 00:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire persuaded him to reverse that
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
position uh just because they needed to
 
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
get people back to work when you give
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
people money constantly and
 
00:54:06.119 --> 00:54:07.010 align:start position:0%
people money constantly and
um

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
over a long period of time the the
 
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
you get that kind of a result
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in the states
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
that allow benefits for 26 weeks like
 
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire currently do
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
individuals are staying out for an
 
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
average of 14 weeks that's uh current
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
according to the testimony that was
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
put into the back of the bill by the
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
in the states that have reformed these
 
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
systems the average is 8.6 weeks
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
so although New Hampshire's
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
is relatively good it's still almost
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
twice as much as many of these states
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
who have you know implemented this type
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
of a indexing system
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
now I've said before that these wages
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
unemployment wages are meant to be a
 
00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:06.900 align:start position:0%
temporary replacement of a part of a
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%
person's income they're not supposed to
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
becoming a permanent entitlement and I'm
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
going to give you a great example this
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
is an email I received last year
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh from an individual not a constituent
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
but from an individual up north
 
00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
and it's an example of what happens when
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
you give the man a fish over and over
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
and over rather than teaching them how
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
how to fish
 
00:55:35.569 --> 00:55:35.579 align:start position:0%
and this was after the it had the senate
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
had uh or it was about the time we were
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
dealing with this in the Senate
 
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
and it was from an individual and I'll
 
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
just read it
 
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
it says from what I understand you want
 
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
to cut the weeks of unemployment
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
by 10 weeks
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
I am in construction I am laid off
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
mid-november till mid-april that means
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
for me three months of no income for me
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
or my family I have a mortgage to pay
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
oil and many bills to pay so if this
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill passes you can pay my bills for
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
those 10 weeks you want to get rid of
 
00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:08.780 align:start position:0%
where are your brains
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
sincerely and his name
 
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
now what I later found out that this is
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is not atypical I had further
 
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
conversations with with this individual
 
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
via email and this individual has been
 
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
doing this for decades
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
they work six six and a half months
 
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
and then they have the expectation that
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to sit at home and collect
 
00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
the unemployment for the remainder and
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
it's not unique as I talked with the
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner about this he also
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is not an infrequent
 
00:56:43.559 --> 00:56:45.069 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is not an infrequent
situation

00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
with today's
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate
 
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
and the inability of businesses to find
 
00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:53.750 align:start position:0%
and the inability of businesses to find
workers

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's nobody here that's going to tell
 
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
me that individual can't find another
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
job for
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
for five or six months that will where
 
00:57:05.089 --> 00:57:05.099 align:start position:0%
he can he or she can make uh
 
00:57:05.099 --> 00:57:06.530 align:start position:0%
he can he or she can make uh
substantially

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
a lot more money for those five or six
 
00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.250 align:start position:0%
a lot more money for those five or six
months

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh than on unemployment probably close
 
00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
to double
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
I mean these days you can't find a job
 
00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:16.730 align:start position:0%
I mean these days you can't find a job
that

00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
pays less than twenty dollars an hour to
 
00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:22.010 align:start position:0%
pays less than twenty dollars an hour to
start

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
and you can be sure those businesses who
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
can't find
 
00:57:29.329 --> 00:57:29.339 align:start position:0%
employees would be more than happy
 
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
to have that individual for five months
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
so in closing I'll just say that the
 
00:57:42.049 --> 00:57:42.059 align:start position:0%
unemployment indexing is rationals
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
responsible it's Common Sense uh it
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
gives a longer term of payments when the
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate is high and in shorter
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
terms when unemployment is low I want to
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
remind you right now it's up to a half
 
00:57:53.650 --> 00:57:53.660 align:start position:0%
year even though
 
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
the average is about 14. yes
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
you've seen in the testimony attached to
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
the bill that we have a very good system
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
it is a good system but do we simply sit
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
back and say We'll accept good when we
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
can potentially make that system uh
 
00:58:12.839 --> 00:58:15.109 align:start position:0%
can potentially make that system uh
better

00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
um again I'm going to go back to the
 
00:58:21.049 --> 00:58:21.059 align:start position:0%
keep calling it testimony in the back of
 
00:58:22.609 --> 00:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
the bill because I've never seen such a
 
00:58:22.619 --> 00:58:23.690 align:start position:0%
the bill because I've never seen such a
long

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:24.530 align:start position:0%
long
um

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
methodology explanation
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
we have a shortage of workers today I
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
mean there's no doubt about it we need
 
00:58:40.849 --> 00:58:40.859 align:start position:0%
to get more people working we don't want
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
to extend the welfare unemployment rule
 
00:58:45.849 --> 00:58:45.859 align:start position:0%
this will ultimately save the businesses
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance taxes
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
we've learned over the last couple years
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
a second segment of our population will
 
00:58:56.089 --> 00:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
remain idle when the monthly total
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
payments are high at one point if you
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
remember they reached almost 3 600 a
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
month here in New Hampshire
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire system is good
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
but we can make it better I sense
 
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
there's a a fear of change
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
that maybe the administration of the
 
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
current program sees
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
I don't see that I see an improvement
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
will it be Monumental in New Hampshire's
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
case probably not some of the other
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
states as we talked about it was very
 
00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:28.609 align:start position:0%
states as we talked about it was very
monumental

00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
monumental
 
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
and once again I'll say 26 weeks that's
 
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
our maximum that is an entire half of
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd be happy to take any
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions I do have committee to get
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
back to but I would be more than happy
 
00:59:43.609 --> 00:59:43.619 align:start position:0%
to take any questions and then I will
 
00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
pass out the white paper
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative turcott are
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
there any questions
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
I I have won last year uh we brought
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
this up you mentioned a significant
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
change in what happened in Florida when
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
this happened and then in the beginning
 
01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:00.980 align:start position:0%
of your testimony you talked about
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
this implementing this would save money
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
to the the New Hampshire trust fund and
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
although it's not written in this
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
as you say lengthy
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
um Financial note you have any
 
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
guess as to the savings that might occur
 
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:20.289 align:start position:0%
guess as to the savings that might occur
no

01:00:20.289 --> 01:00:20.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
but analytically
 
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
there will be a savings what that what
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
the amount will be I I couldn't tell you
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
um in the this that I'll pass out from
 
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
Florida it was significant they turned
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
out a massive bill multi-billion dollar
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
deficit into a a positive uh for the
 
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance fund and then
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
they were able to bring that down
 
01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.270 align:start position:0%
they were able to bring that down
significantly

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
significantly
um

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure deputy
 
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner ladders might have addicts
 
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
that number for you
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%

just a question you're going to pass a
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
white paper out to us I guess is what
 
01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
you said are you the author of that
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
white paper
 
01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:12.299 align:start position:0%
I am not the foundation for a government
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
all right see you more thank you very

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:39.420 align:start position:0%

Mr assistant commissioner welcome

talk with the committee uh this morning
 
01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:46.700 align:start position:0%
I'll let those
 
01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
handouts make their way around
 
01:02:52.609 --> 01:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
just for the record uh Richard laver's
 
01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner New Hampshire
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment Security
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to walk through
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
the slides that I've handed out but
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
certainly as questions arise please
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
interrupt me because I'm going to try to
 
01:03:10.609 --> 01:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
move through those fairly quickly in
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
respect of your time but again as
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
questions come up please stop me and
 
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best to answer those so I
 
01:03:20.569 --> 01:03:20.579 align:start position:0%
believe in the materials that you have
 
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
there I think we address the issues that
 
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
representative turcott has brought up
 
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
with his motivation for filing this bill
 
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
I believe he talked about improving work
 
01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
ethic talked about strengthening the
 
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund employee improving employer
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
taxes making for a faster return to the
 
01:03:40.329 --> 01:03:40.339 align:start position:0%
labor force
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
talked about Florida as the state used
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
as the example of why to do this and
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
then talked about trust fund solvency I
 
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
think all of those issues are addressed
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
but as you have additional questions
 
01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
about any of those please fire away
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
um so the the department opposes this
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
bill we opposed the bill last go around
 
01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:03.500 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
we have not had an opportunity to review
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
this bill with the unemployment
 
01:04:11.809 --> 01:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
compensation advisory Council the
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
council has their regular quarterly
 
01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:15.980 align:start position:0%
meeting coming up this Monday
 
01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
chairman infantine will be there for
 
01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.049 align:start position:0%
chairman infantine will be there for
that

01:04:20.049 --> 01:04:20.059 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:20.059 --> 01:04:21.910 align:start position:0%
that
the

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
majority of that meeting will be focused
 
01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
on legislation we'll be presenting this
 
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
bill to the council they may take a
 
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
position and if they do we will
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
certainly assist the Council and getting
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
that position conveyed to the committee
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
but the department opposes the bill
 
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
um starting starting with the slides to
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
give you a lay of the land on on how New
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Compares with the rest of the
 
01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
country in terms of how many weeks of
 
01:04:53.329 --> 01:04:53.339 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits are currently
 
01:04:53.339 --> 01:04:54.890 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits are currently
available

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
um you can see that New Hampshire is in
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
the mainstream right now in terms of
 
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
their unemployment program and what is
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
available for individuals we have 42
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
States right now that have at least 26
 
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
weeks available on this first chart that
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
you see all of the green states have 26
 
01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
weeks Massachusetts has
 
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
28 or 30 I'm sorry and then Montana has
 
01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
28 weeks currently available so we do
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
have and these are states and
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
territories so we do have 10 states that
 
01:05:35.809 --> 01:05:35.819 align:start position:0%
have less than 26 weeks available
 
01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:39.299 align:start position:0%
when we look at the states with at least
 
01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:41.420 align:start position:0%
26 weeks available
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
10 of them have a uniform duration
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
meaning that someone comes in qualifies
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
for for unemployment benefits because we
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
are an eligibility based program you
 
01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
have to have a qualifying separation be
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
unemployed through no fault of your own
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
be able able to work available to work
 
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
actively conducting a work search each
 
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:04.700 align:start position:0%
and every week so we are an
 
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
eligibility-based program not an
 
01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:08.579 align:start position:0%
entitlement program like
 
01:06:11.049 --> 01:06:11.059 align:start position:0%
um was
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
discussed in the sponsor's testimony so
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
10 States including New Hampshire have a
 
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
uniform 26 weeks available when an
 
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
individual comes in and files we'll go
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
over how many weeks people are currently
 
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
using how many people use all those
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
weeks but right now you come in you
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
qualify you have 26 up to 26 weeks
 
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:33.260 align:start position:0%
available to you
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
32 of those 42 states that have
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
up to 26 weeks they have a variable
 
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
duration so you can get up to 26 but
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
they look at your base period earnings
 
01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
so how much you earned in your base
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
period and over how many quarters you
 
01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
earned wages in your base period the
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
more you earned over more quarters in
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
your base period the more weeks you are
 
01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
eligible for the less you earned over a
 
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
shorter duration during your base period
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
the fewer amount of weeks that you are
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
eligible for but up to 26 weeks so if
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
you had earnings over the course of your
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
whole four quarter base period you're
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
going to be collecting for 26 weeks
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the 10 states that have less than 26
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
weeks so Florida being one of them
 
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
Florida is currently 12 weeks available
 
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
like North Carolina also has 12 weeks
 
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.349 align:start position:0%
like North Carolina also has 12 weeks
available

01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
six of those 10 have variable duration
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
that is based on their base period wages
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
like I just talked about with the the
 
01:07:39.049 --> 01:07:39.059 align:start position:0%
other states but they also look at
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate like representative
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
turcott is proposing here so they don't
 
01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:45.059 align:start position:0%
just look at unemployment rate they look
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
at what your base period earnings were
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
as well and both of those issues go into
 
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
the calculation to determine how many
 
01:07:55.849 --> 01:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
weeks you will receive and then four of
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
those 10 states that have less than 26
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
weeks they they base that determination
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
entirely upon base period wages they
 
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:04.220 align:start position:0%
don't look at unemployment rate
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
so again Florida North Carolina they
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
have 12 weeks available Alabama Georgia
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
have 14 weeks available like being
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
proposed here
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
um when we we moved to the next chart
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
here you can see and this should be
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
familiar to to the members of the
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
committee because we briefly talked
 
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
about it during the orientation but the
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
the lay of the land right now in New
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in terms of utilization of the
 
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
unemployment program you can see in this
 
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
chart for new claims we are 30 below
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
where we were pre-pandemic uh country as
 
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
a whole is 10 below where they were so
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is an outlier in terms of
 
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
the low volume of claims currently being
 
01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
filed the next slide when you look at
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
those weekly claims so someone needs to
 
01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:52.739 align:start position:0%
file an initial claim and a weekly claim
 
01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
and then a weekly claim each week that
 
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
they remain unemployed and are seeking
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits those weekly
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
claims are 36 percent below where we
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
were pre-pandemic and we thought things
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
were pretty good in 2019 uh before the
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit unemployment rate at 2.7
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
percent employers struggling to find
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
worker others nearing full employment
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
but we are 36 percent below where we
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
were in 2019 in terms of weekly filings
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
when you look at Massachusetts and New
 
01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.309 align:start position:0%
when you look at Massachusetts and New
Hampshire

01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
they are below where they were but not
 
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
anywhere close to what New Hampshire is
 
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
experiencing so New Hampshire is an
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
outlier in that regard
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
when we move to the the next page and
 
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
the uh the fourth slide
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
it looks at duration very very important
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
Point uh here uh because it was it was
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
stressed upon with representative
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
turcotte and the the rationale for
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
proposing this is that duration is a
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
problem in states that have a high
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
number of weeks available to them
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
well the current data on that actually
 
01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
suggests quite the opposite so New
 
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now despite having 26
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
weeks of benefits available on average
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
individuals utilize 10 weeks
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
so their unemployment claim utilizes
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
less than half of the weeks they have
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
available to them and this simple reason
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
for that is because it's not necessarily
 
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
a matter of how many weeks you have
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
available to you that really determines
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
how long your main on the unemployment
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
program it's what are the economic
 
01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:41.540 align:start position:0%
conditions in your state
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
that how many jobs are available to you
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
how many good quality jobs are available
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
to you and then also how much is being
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
paid to you while you're receiving
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment how much of your wages from
 
01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
your prior employment are being replaced
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
so when you look at each and every state
 
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
and what their current average duration
 
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire does quite well fifth
 
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
lowest average duration in the country
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
at 10 weeks
 
01:11:12.169 --> 01:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
shorter duration than Florida
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
shorter duration than North Carolina
 
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.010 align:start position:0%
shorter duration than North Carolina
so

01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:18.169 --> 01:11:18.179 align:start position:0%
might be scratching your head on that
 
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
one so states that have 12 weeks maximum
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
available to them right now
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
people filing in those States file for
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
more weeks than in New Hampshire
 
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
despite New Hampshire having 26 weeks
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
available and again it's because the
 
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
economic conditions in the state in
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
which you are looking for employment
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
matter much more than the amount of the
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
number of weeks that you have available
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
and so you can see in on that chart the
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
yellow bars are the states that have
 
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
shorter or a lower number of weeks
 
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
available and you can see where they
 
01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
shake out in terms of their average
 
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.370 align:start position:0%
shake out in terms of their average
duration

01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
when you move to the the next slide
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
which looks at a very similar topic but
 
01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:09.179 align:start position:0%
looks at exhaustion rates so exhaustion
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
is looking at how many people that file
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
for benefits how many of them use all of
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
the benefits they have available to them
 
01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire that would be all 26
 
01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire that would be all 26
weeks

01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the lowest exhaustion
 
01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
rate in the whole country
 
01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.410 align:start position:0%
rate in the whole country
okay

01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:26.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
8.6 percent of people filing for
 
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits in New Hampshire
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
utilize all 26 weeks now on average
 
01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
they're using 10
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
but less than one out of every 10 people
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
that file for unemployment benefits in
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire currently utilize all 26
 
01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.430 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire currently utilize all 26
weeks

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
now when we look at Florida
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
in North Carolina
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
they have the highest exhaustion rates
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
fewer weeks granted each of those states
 
01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
have 12 weeks available to them
 
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
but they have higher exhaustion rates so
 
01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:06.659 align:start position:0%
right now in Florida nearly 70 percent
 
01:13:06.659 --> 01:13:08.450 align:start position:0%
right now in Florida nearly 70 percent
7-0

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
7-0
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
of their people filing for unemployment
 
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
benefits utilize all 12 weeks
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's 8.6 percent Florida
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
worst in the country for exhaustion New
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire best in the country for
 
01:13:24.719 --> 01:13:26.570 align:start position:0%
Hampshire best in the country for
exhaustion

01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
exhaustion
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
when we go to the the next slide which
 
01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:32.090 align:start position:0%
when we go to the the next slide which
compares

01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
compares
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
Florida and New Hampshire over the last
 
01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
five years looking at exhaustion rates
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
um you can see there's really not much
 
01:13:41.689 --> 01:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
of a comparison
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
so we look back at the the
 
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
pandemic recession Florida was at a
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
hundred percent exhaustion New Hampshire
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
30 percent
 
01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:55.640 align:start position:0%
we look now we're near that 70
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
exhaustion 67.4 percent precisely for
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
Florida and 8.6 percent for New
 
01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:05.149 align:start position:0%
Florida and 8.6 percent for New
Hampshire

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
so the suggestion that individuals in
 
01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
the unemployment program are going to
 
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
use all of the weeks they have available
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
is not true based on experience and
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
administering that program but it's not
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
true based on the actual data and it's
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
not a fluke it's not just because I
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
picked I cherry-picked a great quarter
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
to use you've got five years of data
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
right here comparing Florida and New
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
when we move to the the next slide and
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
we look at
 
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
a comparison of
 
01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:43.610 align:start position:0%
a comparison of
um

01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
and I've got to make a point here having
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
an economist that works for you with
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
Brian gottlub is a wonderful thing to
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
have I know the song said Lawyers Guns
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
and Money but having an economist is
 
01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.110 align:start position:0%
and Money but having an economist is
great

01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.010 align:start position:0%
great
um

01:14:58.010 --> 01:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
when you when you look at uh mapping out
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
and overlaying
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed weeks in the the formula
 
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
for calculating those weeks in House
 
01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 190 and you put that over history
 
01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
going back to 2000. so that covers three
 
01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
recessionary periods a modest one a
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
severe one and then an explosive one
 
01:15:23.689 --> 01:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic recession
 
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
and you look at our actual average
 
01:15:26.219 --> 01:15:27.770 align:start position:0%
and you look at our actual average
duration

01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
duration
 
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
you can see that
 
01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
what would have happened with if House
 
01:15:36.649 --> 01:15:36.659 align:start position:0%
Bill 190 had been in place in New
 
01:15:36.659 --> 01:15:37.850 align:start position:0%
Bill 190 had been in place in New
Hampshire

01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
that during each recessionary period and
 
01:15:44.090 --> 01:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
coming out of those recessionary periods
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
there would not have been enough weeks
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
to satisfy the demand at the time for
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
people that were filing for unemployment
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
so the red line here is the proposal the
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
proposed number of weeks that would be
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
available based on the the calculation
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
using the fourth quarter's unemployment
 
01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.030 align:start position:0%
using the fourth quarter's unemployment
rate

01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
and the blue line shows you what the
 
01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
actual average duration was the gray
 
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
bars are the recessions
 
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
so 2001 you can see actual duration much
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
higher than that which would have been
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
allowed by House Bill 190 similar to the
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
the 2008 recession and then very much
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
true during the pandemic recession
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:16:29.689 --> 01:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
the the good thing of one of many good
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
things about the unemployment program in
 
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
is that it is sized to meet the demand
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
so right now we're doing a good job of
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
getting people back to work the
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
department would like to take some
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
credit for that but I think private
 
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
employers probably deserve more credit
 
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
for that because they have jobs
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
available so the economic conditions are
 
01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:51.659 align:start position:0%
good people don't need
 
01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
right now they only need 10 weeks on
 
01:16:57.050 --> 01:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
average of the 26 weeks available
 
01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
but that's not what where you know
 
01:17:01.610 --> 01:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
policy isn't just looking at what we're
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
currently experiencing we need to look
 
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:06.659 align:start position:0%
at what is going to happen again at some
 
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
point we experience a recession every
 
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
seven years so it's going to happen
 
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
again and when we have had recessionary
 
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
periods looking at the three most recent
 
01:17:17.689 --> 01:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
people need more weeks because of the
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
economic conditions at the time
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 190 would not have provided
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient numbers of weeks during those
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
periods and ironically it would have
 
01:17:30.649 --> 01:17:30.659 align:start position:0%
provided more weeks when we were in
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
recovery recovery periods when people
 
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
didn't need them because it relies Upon
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
A lagging indicator with the
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate I know we published
 
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate so why am I
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
bashing the unemployment rate well you
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
notice we don't really use it for much
 
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
we put it out there and say hey this is
 
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
where we were last month
 
01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
but it's not something we use to
 
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
determine where we are right now and
 
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
where we're going we actually use a
 
01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
whole assortment of of real-time high
 
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
frequency indicators not a lagging
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
indicator like the unemployment rate but
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
you can see how House Bill 190 would
 
01:18:09.169 --> 01:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
have performed in those three
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
and addressing the point made about uh
 
01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:27.659 align:start position:0%
uh work ethic and uh
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
you know reducing the number of weeks to
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
strengthen work ethic reducing the
 
01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
number of weeks to to strengthen and
 
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
um increase the labor force
 
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
um so we know that New Hampshire on
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
average 10 weeks right so I think work
 
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
ethic is pretty good in New Hampshire we
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
historically have a higher labor force
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
participation rate than the rest of the
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
country and we have a lower average
 
01:18:53.209 --> 01:18:53.219 align:start position:0%
duration of unemployment benefits than
 
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country both good
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
indicators for what our work ethic here
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
but when you look at this next chart
 
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
with the red yellow and blue bars this
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
looks at New Hampshire Florida and North
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
Carolina and what it does is it looks at
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
individuals that filed a new
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment claim how many of them
 
01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
had actual wages in the next quarter
 
01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.290 align:start position:0%
had actual wages in the next quarter
okay

01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire
 
01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:24.659 align:start position:0%
this data which is uh five years ending
 
01:19:25.870 --> 01:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
Florida stopped submitting data I don't
 
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
know why but so this is up to 2018 uh 72
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
percent of individuals filing a new
 
01:19:36.530 --> 01:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
claim showed wages in the next quarter
 
01:19:38.209 --> 01:19:38.219 align:start position:0%
meaning they were getting right back to
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
work uh Florida down about 57 percent
 
01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:45.659 align:start position:0%
North Carolina at about 65 percent if we
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
were to walk this forward to the most
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
current available data New Hampshire has
 
01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
about 78 of individuals that file a new
 
01:19:57.050 --> 01:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
claim show wages in the next quarter I
 
01:19:58.850 --> 01:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
don't know Florida North Carolina
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
because that data is not currently
 
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:07.550 align:start position:0%
because that data is not currently
available

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
um looking at the the next slide and the
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
issue about
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
um healthy trust fund and healthy
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
unemployment program
 
01:20:23.209 --> 01:20:23.219 align:start position:0%
um what this slide does is it looks at
 
01:20:26.649 --> 01:20:26.659 align:start position:0%
each State's Reliance on federal
 
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
assistance during the pandemic for
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
unemployment purposes
 
01:20:30.719 --> 01:20:32.090 align:start position:0%
unemployment purposes
and

01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
why this is important and why we looked
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
at this was
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
we felt New Hampshire had done a really
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
good job of paying people from the
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
correct program and which results in
 
01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
less audit findings and less problems
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
with the US Department of Labor down the
 
01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:46.910 align:start position:0%
with the US Department of Labor down the
road

01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
road
 
01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
but we also had a right-sized
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment program so because we had
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
26 weeks available we had a solvent
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
trust fund at the start of the pandemic
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
governor sununa was able to actually
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
create and expanded unemployment program
 
01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
providing benefits to Gig workers and
 
01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
self-employed and people that didn't
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
have enough wages he was able to do that
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
about two weeks ahead of the federal
 
01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
government passing the cares act again
 
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
because he had a solvent trust fund he
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
had 26 weeks available States that had
 
01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
fewer weeks didn't have that option to
 
01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
them they couldn't react as quickly as
 
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could and what you see
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
here in this chart is that states that
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
have fewer weeks available in their
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment program they rely upon the
 
01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
federal government to bail them out much
 
01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
more quickly and to a much higher degree
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
this looks at how many dollars in
 
01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic unemployment benefits were paid
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
per covered worker in each state you can
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
see New Hampshire did very well we're
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
over on the left hand side of this
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
column Florida was about out twice as
 
01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
much pandemic unemployment assistance
 
01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:53.219 align:start position:0%
that that state needed in order to
 
01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
address the workers needs during the
 
01:21:57.729 --> 01:21:57.739 align:start position:0%
pandemic then New Hampshire needed again
 
01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
because of the weeks The Limited number
 
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
of weeks they had available and as we'll
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
get into also because of the solvency or
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
um when we when we talk I know there had
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
been some questions about and I'd raised
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
the point about the amount that someone
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
gets paid on unemployment has an impact
 
01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:22.739 align:start position:0%
on how quickly they're going to be
 
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
returning to work New Hampshire has
 
01:22:27.729 --> 01:22:27.739 align:start position:0%
about a 30 percent wage replacement rate
 
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
on average right now our average weekly
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
benefit amount and this slide looks at
 
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
each state's average weekly benefit
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
amount currently New Hampshire is at
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
about 320 dollars a week 17th lowest in
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
the Country Florida they're at 253
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
dollars a week average weekly benefit
 
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.770 align:start position:0%
dollars a week average weekly benefit
amount

01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
um write down with Mississippi Louisiana
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
and Alabama in terms of how much they
 
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:02.930 align:start position:0%
and again
um

01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire that wage replacement
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
rate is about 30 percent
 
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
um so and that's a comparison of what
 
01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
someone would receive on unemployment
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
compared to what they were earning in
 
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
private sector employment
 
01:23:17.149 --> 01:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
um when you look at this next slide you
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
can see the New Hampshire and Florida
 
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
actually are are pretty close despite
 
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
Florida having a much lower average
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount they're both at
 
01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
about 30 percent
 
01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
um country as a whole is about 38
 
01:23:32.229 --> 01:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
percent wage replacement
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Florida are close just
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
because Florida is a low-wage state
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
compared to New Hampshire so that's why
 
01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
despite New Hampshire having a higher
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount we also have
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
higher private sector average earnings
 
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're close even though we
 
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
have a higher average weekly benefit
 
01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:52.610 align:start position:0%
have a higher average weekly benefit
amount

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
when we when we Turn the Page we get
 
01:23:59.450 --> 01:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
into some of the tax issues and
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
arguments that have been brought forward
 
01:24:04.630 --> 01:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
that the reducing the number of weeks is
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
healthier for Employers in the state
 
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
from a from an unemployment insurance
 
01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
tax perspective what you can see here
 
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
is and we share this in our orientation
 
01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
session but New Hampshire has seen
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
explosive growth in employers since the
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
pandemic we're up about 21 percent we
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
added about 9 000 registered Employers
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
um the tax experience of employers in
 
01:24:32.050 --> 01:24:32.060 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
we peaked at a unemployment insurance
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
tax rate that was about 40 percent below
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
where we peaked during the Great
 
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
Recession that tax rate has come down
 
01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:45.530 align:start position:0%
Recession that tax rate has come down
significantly

01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
um the quarter that you cannot see here
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
which would be Q4 of 2022 that data is
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
not available for this slide that rate
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
will be down around one percent and we
 
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
know that because employers started
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
receiving their their fund balance
 
01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
reduction because of the growth in the
 
01:25:05.209 --> 01:25:05.219 align:start position:0%
trust fund they started receiving that
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
in the fourth quarter so everyone got a
 
01:25:09.530 --> 01:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
half Point reduction in their
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate starting with the
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter they're getting it in the
 
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
first quarter as well saving them about
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
28 million dollars so tax rates have
 
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
been falling
 
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
and then the last slide looking at
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
getting into the solvency discussion and
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
I want to spend some time
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
talking about this
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
and there's a whole bunch of numbers
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
that I don't have memorized so I need to
 
01:25:39.610 --> 01:25:39.620 align:start position:0%
get to my
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
notes Here
 
01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.910 align:start position:0%
notes Here
uh

01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
but when we look at trust fund solvency
 
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's an incredibly important topic okay
 
01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
there's I think six people in the state
 
01:25:52.729 --> 01:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
that really care about it chairman
 
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
infant times one I'm another one Brian
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
gottlub is one
 
01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:00.900 align:start position:0%
um and I think Gary Abbott he actually
 
01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:02.699 align:start position:0%
has a strange fascination with trust
 
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
fund solvency sitting behind me but it's
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
an incredibly important topic for
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
employers and the reason why it's
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
important is because if you have a
 
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
solvent trust fund then when you get
 
01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
into an economic downturn then the
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
likelihood is that you will not need to
 
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
borrow from the federal government in
 
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
order to pay unemployment benefits
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
during that economic downturn
 
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
states that need to borrow then face
 
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
problems for their Employers in the form
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
of reductions in their federal
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance tax credits so
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
when that happens employers start having
 
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
to pay more in taxes to support the
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment program or their Federal
 
01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
share of unemployment insurance taxes so
 
01:26:52.129 --> 01:26:52.139 align:start position:0%
borrowing is not a good thing it's good
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
to have that support from the federal
 
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
government if you are unable to meet the
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
obligations of your your unemployed
 
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
population but long term not good for
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
the Employers in your state
 
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
um what we have here is the solvency
 
01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
scores of all the states
 
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
okay so every April the U.S Department
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
of Labor publishes a solvency report in
 
01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
that report they
 
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
provide analysis and give a score to
 
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
every State's trust fund and what they
 
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
look at is they look at what your
 
01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
current trust fund balance is as of
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
January of that year so the most recent
 
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
report we have is from April of 22 they
 
01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
use January balances for that report
 
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
they then look at your three worst
 
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
benefit years in the last 20 years and
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
then they look at what your total wages
 
01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
are in the state because they're really
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
all about assessing risk right it's an
 
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
insurance program Insurance product we
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
care very much about risk
 
01:27:56.450 --> 01:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
they then give each state a score that
 
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
they call the average high cost multiple
 
01:28:02.290 --> 01:28:02.300 align:start position:0%
the ahcm okay if you achieve a score of
 
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:03.910 align:start position:0%
the ahcm okay if you achieve a score of
1.0

01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
1.0
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
ahcm you are considered minimally
 
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
solvent by U.S department of labor
 
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
meaning they think that you can probably
 
01:28:13.129 --> 01:28:13.139 align:start position:0%
pay benefits out of your trust fund when
 
01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
you encounter the next economic downturn
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
they don't know you know I used to joke
 
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
around saying solvency is like getting
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
ready for a race I don't know am I
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
getting ready for a 5k or a marathon I
 
01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'm going to be in good
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
enough shape we don't know what the next
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
economic downturn is going to be but
 
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
this is what U.S Department of Labor
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
uses to try to measure that so when they
 
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
took that measurement prior to the
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic 2019 New Hampshire was solvent
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
we had an ahcm of 1.04 in Florida
 
01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
Florida was also solvent okay Florida
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
was a slightly higher ahcm they're 1.07
 
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
so a little bit more solve than New
 
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at that time
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
we had about 311 million dollars in our
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
trust fund at that point in time Florida
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
had 3.8 billion okay of course the
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
state's 17 times the size of New
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the labor force is 15 times
 
01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
the size of New Hampshire so having a
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
trust fund that's 12 times the size of
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's about right okay we
 
01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
were both solvent though when you looked
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
at usdol
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
fast forward to 2023 and based on the
 
01:29:24.649 --> 01:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
report that was filed or released in
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%
April of of 22 because that's the most
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
recent one we have neither of the states
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
were solvent okay New Hampshire was at
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
about 0.55 remember we want a 1.0 ahcm
 
01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
to be considered solvent Florida was at
 
01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
about a point three four
 
01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:47.219 align:start position:0%
but what we can do in anticipating the
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
next report that will come out in April
 
01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
of this year because again that April 22
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
report looks at trust fund balances from
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
January of 22. we can look at what we've
 
01:30:00.649 --> 01:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
had for trust fund growth in that time
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
period so New Hampshire's trust fund
 
01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
went from 190 million when they released
 
01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:06.420 align:start position:0%
that report finding that we were not
 
01:30:10.129 --> 01:30:10.139 align:start position:0%
solvent we're now at 360 million
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've had about 84 percent
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
growth in our trust fund over the course
 
01:30:17.689 --> 01:30:17.699 align:start position:0%
of that time period when you apply those
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
figures to our ahcm New Hampshire is
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
currently solvent good news so we have
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
an ahcm that is over 1.0 it's higher
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
than where we were prior to the pandemic
 
01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
um you know we're about 50 million
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
um above where we were prior to the
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic so New Hampshire is solvent
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
Florida's not
 
01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
so Florida's had about 40 percent growth
 
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
in their trust fund Revenue during that
 
01:30:46.729 --> 01:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
time period remember they started prior
 
01:30:49.729 --> 01:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
to the pandemic at 3.8 billion they're
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
now at about 2 billion but they're not
 
01:30:53.450 --> 01:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
solvent they're not even close to
 
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
solvent when you apply that growth in
 
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
their trust fund to their prior report
 
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
that puts them under 0.5 so they're not
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
even halfway to being solvent that's a
 
01:31:03.719 --> 01:31:05.090 align:start position:0%
even halfway to being solvent that's a
problem

01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
um but I I think when you when you look
 
01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.050 align:start position:0%
um but I I think when you when you look
at

01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the statistics and the numbers that
 
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
we've talked about you can understand
 
01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:13.310 align:start position:0%
we've talked about you can understand
why

01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
um based upon the lack of solvency in
 
01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
Florida and why they have only 12 weeks
 
01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
available and they can't afford to pay
 
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
individuals for more weeks because they
 
01:31:24.050 --> 01:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
don't do a very good job of getting
 
01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
individuals back to work
 
01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
they have high exhaustion rates so more
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
than two-thirds of their people use all
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
the weeks that are available to them New
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire less you know less than one in
 
01:31:38.209 --> 01:31:38.219 align:start position:0%
ten use all the weeks available to them
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has shorter duration
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
despite more weeks available so we on
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
average people use 10 weeks Florida
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
North Carolina on average people use 11
 
01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:49.430 align:start position:0%
North Carolina on average people use 11
weeks

01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
um so without a solvent trust fund
 
01:31:55.790 --> 01:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
and without real good effort on working
 
01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
to make connections between hiring
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
employers and job Seekers then I can see
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
why you wouldn't offer more weeks
 
01:32:05.930 --> 01:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
because in Florida it is true people use
 
01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
all the weeks that are available to them
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that is not the case the
 
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
department feels that our current
 
01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
structure of our unemployment program 26
 
01:32:19.010 --> 01:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
weeks available with with strict
 
01:32:21.770 --> 01:32:21.780 align:start position:0%
requirements on weekly work search on
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
being able to work available to work and
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
heavily policing that as we do in our
 
01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
responsible administration of the
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
program we feel that the program is
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
sized correctly now
 
01:32:37.689 --> 01:32:37.699 align:start position:0%
any changes to that the concern would be
 
01:32:40.970 --> 01:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
that we would be undersizing the program
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have enough weeks available
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
to individuals when we encounter the
 
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
next economic downturn and we would be
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
making ourselves much more dependent
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
upon the federal government to bail us
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
out to bail out our unemployment program
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
in order to provide support to
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
individuals when they're unemployed
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own because
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
the state can't afford to do it
 
01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.629 align:start position:0%
the state can't afford to do it
now

01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get to that point in
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
time and and I hope the the committee
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
agrees with the Department's position on
 
01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:13.139 align:start position:0%
this I know I've thrown out a lot of
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
information to the members I do thank
 
01:33:18.370 --> 01:33:18.380 align:start position:0%
you for giving me a little bit more time
 
01:33:21.169 --> 01:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
and I hopefully can answer any questions
 
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
that folks might have
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
um Mr Vice chairman
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
um my question is you heard the sponsor
 
01:33:37.850 --> 01:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
gave us an example of a seasonal worker
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
who then uses unemployment for the
 
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
off-season could you help remind me what
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
the obligations are on say a
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
construction worker
 
01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
in order to remain qualified for for
 
01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:55.139 align:start position:0%
benefits during up to
 
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
half the year
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
so it it's a good point so right now in
 
01:34:01.729 --> 01:34:01.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:34:04.370 --> 01:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
um seasonal employees are allowed to
 
01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
file for unemployment's employment
 
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
benefits during their off season you're
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
also allowed to have part part-time
 
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
earnings while you're collecting
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits so seasonal
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
workers so our our bus drivers our
 
01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
school cafeteria workers our landscapers
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
our construction workers our civil
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
construction workers on Road and Bridge
 
01:34:28.850 --> 01:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
projects during their off season those
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
individuals have a qualifying separation
 
01:34:34.129 --> 01:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
from work they are allowed to file for
 
01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits on average they
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
get about 30 percent wage replacement so
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
30 percent of the wages they were
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
earning is what they're getting in
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment that's an incentive for
 
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
many people not to utilize the
 
01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
unemployment Program in those situations
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
but they are eligible
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
what what happens with regard to the
 
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
obligation to search for work
 
01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
is there was a change made in 2018
 
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
19 time period
 
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
um uh legislative change made so it's in
 
01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
our statute so an individual that is on
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
a temporary layoff and they have a
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
definite date for return to work that is
 
01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
less than 11 weeks away
 
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
they do not have to search for work
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
during the period that is less than 11
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
weeks so that can apply to bus drivers
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
it can apply to any of your seasonal
 
01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:31.790 align:start position:0%
it can apply to any of your seasonal
workers

01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
if you're if your temporary layoff is
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to be longer than that period you
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
have to search Fork the entire period if
 
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
you don't have a definite date for
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
return to work you just your employer
 
01:35:48.169 --> 01:35:48.179 align:start position:0%
thinks they're going to be bringing you
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
back you have to search for work that
 
01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
entire time period and you do that on
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
your weekly claim filing when you're
 
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
doing that electronically so that's how
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
the current work search waiver is
 
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
implemented based upon the statutory
 
01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:03.470 align:start position:0%
implemented based upon the statutory
requirement

01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
thank you could you further explain how
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
in doing that
 
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
for the new folks here how we reduce the
 
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
employers with a negative balance
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
so the as you can imagine this is a good
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
point getting into more about trust fund
 
01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
solvency so employers that have seasonal
 
01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
patterns to their Workforce have put a
 
01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
much bigger burden on the unemployment
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
program right then say an employer that
 
01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any seasonality in their
 
01:36:35.930 --> 01:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
Workforce but occasionally we'll have a
 
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
need to lay somebody off so we have in
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you you're either if
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
you're a for-profit employer you're
 
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
either positive rated or you're negative
 
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
rated okay so positive rated employers
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
are those employers that have paid more
 
01:36:52.129 --> 01:36:52.139 align:start position:0%
into the unemployment program through
 
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
their quarterly tax payments than the
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
department has paid out and benefits to
 
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
their workers
 
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
negative rated employers many of whom
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
are seasonal employers are those that
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
have paid in less in taxes that we have
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
paid out in benefits what happens to
 
01:37:09.649 --> 01:37:09.659 align:start position:0%
those negative rated employers is they
 
01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
have a much higher tax rate
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
so if you are new to being negative
 
01:37:18.010 --> 01:37:18.020 align:start position:0%
maybe that maybe there was just a a bump
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
in your um whatever your business area
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
was and you lost a few customers you had
 
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
to lay a few people off it caused you to
 
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
go negative if you're negative less than
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
four years then you move on to a middle
 
01:37:36.169 --> 01:37:36.179 align:start position:0%
tax table your rates are a little bit
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
higher they're not as low as they were
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
when you were positive rated but they're
 
01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
not as high as those chronically
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
negative rated employers that have more
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
of that that seasonal burden on the
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
employment unemployment program so those
 
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
those individual those employers that
 
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
are negative rated for more than four
 
01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
years they're on the third table the
 
01:37:59.330 --> 01:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
highest rates upwards of seven and a
 
01:38:00.370 --> 01:38:00.380 align:start position:0%
half percent
 
01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
and they also don't share in the
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
experience of those fund balance
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
reductions to the degree that are
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
positive rate rated employers do so they
 
01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
pay at higher rates they have they're
 
01:38:18.830 --> 01:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
paying in more taxes into the trust fund
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
because their experience is negative and
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
and your seasonal employers that have
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
regular seasonality like that fall into
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
that last group with the highest rates
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie then so Paul by
 
01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:34.189 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie then so Paul by
Sullivan

01:38:34.189 --> 01:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
Sullivan
 
01:38:38.209 --> 01:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.770 --> 01:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:38:43.370 --> 01:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
the uh the question I have is a phrase
 
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
that come up to you then I'm not real
 
01:38:47.870 --> 01:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with this variable duration
 
01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm particularly concerned about uh
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
the the impact on low-wage workers
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
if the unemployment benefit is based as
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
I understand it from representative
 
01:39:01.129 --> 01:39:01.139 align:start position:0%
turcotte is based on the amount of wages
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
that you receive
 
01:39:03.239 --> 01:39:04.129 align:start position:0%
that you receive
um

01:39:04.129 --> 01:39:04.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:07.129 --> 01:39:07.139 align:start position:0%
in the and so low wage workers can you
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
explain how potentially that could
 
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
affect low-wage workers as opposed to
 
01:39:12.770 --> 01:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
high wage workers who uh who may be
 
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
accumulated that very quicker so the so
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
just to clarify New Hampshire is a
 
01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
uniform duration state right so when you
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
come in you have up to 26 weeks
 
01:39:25.610 --> 01:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
available some states as we had had
 
01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
reviewed some states have variable
 
01:39:29.689 --> 01:39:29.699 align:start position:0%
duration looking at base period earnings
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
so how that how that works in New
 
01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:32.290 align:start position:0%
so how that how that works in New
Hampshire

01:39:32.290 --> 01:39:32.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
so your base period is the first four of
 
01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
the most recently completed five
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
calendar quarters
 
01:39:41.450 --> 01:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
so we look at those four quarters and we
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
see what you earned in covered
 
01:39:46.129 --> 01:39:46.139 align:start position:0%
employment W-2 employment and based upon
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
those total earnings is going to
 
01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
determine what your weekly benefit
 
01:39:52.129 --> 01:39:52.139 align:start position:0%
amount is so the weekly benefit amount
 
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
is set in statute is a statutory table
 
01:39:56.649 --> 01:39:56.659 align:start position:0%
in 282a
 
01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
you have minimal the minimal earnings
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
requirement during that base period is
 
01:40:04.010 --> 01:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
twenty eight hundred dollars so during
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
those four quarters you have to have
 
01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
earned fourteen hundred dollars in each
 
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
of two quarters in order to be
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
monetarily eligible so if you had twenty
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
eight hundred dollars in one quarter in
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
your base period and less than 14 and
 
01:40:20.450 --> 01:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
all the other quarters you are not
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
monetarily eligible for unemployment
 
01:40:26.090 --> 01:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
benefits so if you have that 1400 in
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
each of two quarters in your base period
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
your your weekly benefit amount would be
 
01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
twenty seven dollars a week
 
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
um actually might even be less than that
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
I don't have the table memorized uh to
 
01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
heart I know the the top end which is
 
01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:40.669 align:start position:0%
heart I know the the top end which is
427.

01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
427.
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
um that is what you would get if you
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
were at 41.5 during your base period so
 
01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
if you earn at least forty one thousand
 
01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
dollars 41 500 during your base period
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
during those four quarters you are going
 
01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
to top out at the maximum weekly benefit
 
01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
amount in New Hampshire 427 dollars a
 
01:41:01.850 --> 01:41:01.860 align:start position:0%
week if you have a hundred thousand
 
01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
dollars in your base period you get 427
 
01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:06.659 align:start position:0%
a week if you have two hundred thousand
 
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
dollars in your base period you get 427
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
a week so we look at base period
 
01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
earnings the more base period earnings
 
01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
you have as long as you satisfy those
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
two quarters of at least 1400
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
um your weekly benefit amount increases
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
up to that 427 the less you have in
 
01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
earnings during those four quarters than
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
the less your weekly benefit amount is
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
01:41:37.490 --> 01:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good to see you
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner um
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
that 8.6 of people who use the full 26
 
01:41:49.850 --> 01:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
weeks I'm it's a very low number
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
um Department should be proud New
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be proud
 
01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:54.350 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be proud
um

01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm interested in knowing who those
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
people are what what kind of life
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
experience have they gone through that
 
01:42:04.729 --> 01:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
requires them unlike
 
01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
um over 90 percent of everyone else who
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
goes on unemployment what causes them to
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
use the full 26 weeks
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
so it
 
01:42:15.770 --> 01:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for the the comments
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
about the 8.6 percent we're proud of
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
um so one of the factors uh that does uh
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
come in when you're looking at the
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
number of weeks that someone files for
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
and and we had talked about this uh
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
during the uh the last session with with
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
um there are a large number of the
 
01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
individuals that file for more weeks
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
they have part-time earnings
 
01:42:42.649 --> 01:42:42.659 align:start position:0%
um so they're allowed to work part-time
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
um part-time hours part-time earnings
 
01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
while they're collecting their
 
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit but what it does is
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
those earnings reduce their unemployment
 
01:42:49.199 --> 01:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
those earnings reduce their unemployment
benefit

01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:51.050 align:start position:0%
benefit
okay

01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
and so when they're when they're working
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
part-time and those earnings are
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
reducing their unemployment benefit now
 
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
it's stretching out over how many weeks
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
you can get your maximum weeks available
 
01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
to you okay so if you're working
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
part-time and say you normally would
 
01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
have been getting
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
um 250 a week but with your part-time
 
01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
earnings that's knocked down to a
 
01:43:17.330 --> 01:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
hundred and fifty dollars a week now
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're getting less each week
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
your attachment to labor force is better
 
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
which is what we want to see but you
 
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
might need you might be filing for a
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
longer period of time but your weekly
 
01:43:31.609 --> 01:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
benefit amount is going to be less so so
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
quite a few of those individuals in that
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
grouping that file for up to the 26
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
weeks and some file for for more than
 
01:43:42.169 --> 01:43:42.179 align:start position:0%
that because they have the benefits
 
01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
available to them because their
 
01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
part-time earnings have been reducing
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
their maximum benefits available they
 
01:43:48.609 --> 01:43:48.619 align:start position:0%
have they have those part-time earnings
 
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
and so those are more in your where
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
those where those jobs fall or more
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
likely be Hospitality retail with those
 
01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
part-time workers and those are a lot of
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
the folks that use more weeks so
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
um that 8.6 very low number on average
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
were at 10 weeks
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
um but you do have those that are up up
 
01:44:14.330 --> 01:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
in those higher
 
01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
um weak groupings and I can share that
 
01:44:16.619 --> 01:44:17.930 align:start position:0%
um weak groupings and I can share that
information

01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:44:21.370 --> 01:44:21.380 align:start position:0%
um with the committee I have uh 2018
 
01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
uh 2019 and then
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
um the second half of 22.
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
um and the reason why I'll only provide
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
the second half of 22 is because it gets
 
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
out of the pandemic influence so but
 
01:44:37.149 --> 01:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
what you can see based upon that data
 
01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
2018-19 about 65 to 70 percent of people
 
01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:43.820 align:start position:0%
were filing for less than 14 weeks
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
when you look at the 22 data about 76
 
01:44:50.209 --> 01:44:50.219 align:start position:0%
percent of individuals are filing for
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
less than 14 weeks so that in that that
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
22 grouping I think it was 3 800
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
individuals that were in that sample
 
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
size so about 800 of them were filing
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
for more than more than 14 weeks so
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
you'll see that in the data that I make
 
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
available to chairman infantine
 
01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:09.770 align:start position:0%
available to chairman infantine
follow-up

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
still drilling down on those 8.6 percent
 
01:45:15.169 --> 01:45:15.179 align:start position:0%
of the people other than the part-time
 
01:45:18.010 --> 01:45:18.020 align:start position:0%
workers are there other folks who have
 
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
somehow fall on hard times that it's
 
01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
making it
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
more difficult than usual for them to
 
01:45:26.990 --> 01:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
actually be able to land a job of any
 
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.330 align:start position:0%
actually be able to land a job of any
sort

01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:32.209 --> 01:45:32.219 align:start position:0%
um I think you're likely looking at
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
individuals who might require a longer
 
01:45:36.649 --> 01:45:36.659 align:start position:0%
period of training
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
um perhaps they're going in a different
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
vocational Direction
 
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
and as long as that training is approved
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
training through the department they're
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
able to collect their unemployment
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
benefit while they're enrolled in
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
training perhaps that training is going
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
on uh longer putting them in that that
 
01:45:54.290 --> 01:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
grouping of 8.6 of of exhaustees and
 
01:45:55.729 --> 01:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
certainly above the 10 weeks average
 
01:45:58.970 --> 01:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
duration in terms of other uh
 
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
characteristics of that group I don't
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
know it off the top of my head but we
 
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
can we can certainly look at that but
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
any other demographic characteristics at
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
least to the extent we have that
 
01:46:09.659 --> 01:46:10.570 align:start position:0%
least to the extent we have that
information

01:46:10.570 --> 01:46:10.580 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
that can be provided as well thank you
 
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
just a moment I want to follow up on
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
something then I'll but I know people
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
have their hands off
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
following on representative Sullivan's
 
01:46:24.109 --> 01:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
question about the 8.6 and the part-time
 
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
employees we now allow employees to
 
01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
receive unemployment benefits When
 
01:46:31.609 --> 01:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
possibly their employer because of a
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
seasonal situation doesn't want to lay
 
01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
them off but only has fewer hours
 
01:46:39.290 --> 01:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
so they can make unemployment of the
 
01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:40.669 align:start position:0%
so they can make unemployment of the
difference

01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
it's important to me to understand what
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
percent is about 8.6 percent is that
 
01:46:45.239 --> 01:46:46.550 align:start position:0%
percent is about 8.6 percent is that
so

01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:48.890 --> 01:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
because that's that's not someone that's
 
01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:49.729 align:start position:0%
because that's that's not someone that's
not

01:46:49.729 --> 01:46:49.739 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:46:51.649 --> 01:46:51.659 align:start position:0%
occasionally capable of going back to
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
work or someone that's milking it if you
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
will and not going back to work so I
 
01:46:58.250 --> 01:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can and your numbers
 
01:47:00.590 --> 01:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
break down break that down but that
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
would be important to me to understand
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we can show uh the number the
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
number of individuals in that 8.6
 
01:47:09.530 --> 01:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
percent that actually show partial
 
01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:10.850 align:start position:0%
percent that actually show partial
earnings

01:47:10.850 --> 01:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
earnings
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
um during their time filing your
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie
 
01:47:19.729 --> 01:47:19.739 align:start position:0%
thank you um this is always the case
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
with unemployment it's a rapid hole you
 
01:47:23.689 --> 01:47:23.699 align:start position:0%
go down and it's very difficult to
 
01:47:26.689 --> 01:47:26.699 align:start position:0%
unpack some of this stuff but let me uh
 
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
let me ask you uh this question is it
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
relates to construction workers as
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to in comparison to ordinary
 
01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:35.629 align:start position:0%
opposed to in comparison to ordinary
workers

01:47:35.629 --> 01:47:35.639 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
so when the unemployment system you have
 
01:47:40.250 --> 01:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
to be you have to be available for work
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
so you deny people who come in and say
 
01:47:45.490 --> 01:47:45.500 align:start position:0%
we can't we're not available for work
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh and yet there is an exception in the
 
01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
in the in the law that allows people in
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
the construction industry who are going
 
01:47:55.490 --> 01:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
to come back at some point there's a
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
fixed period they they're not required
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
to look for work is that correct
 
01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
correct they're not if if they fit
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
within that uh having a definite date
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
for return to work in less than 11 weeks
 
01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
they do not have to conduct a weekly
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
work search but they do need to be able
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
for work and they need to be available
 
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
for work
 
01:48:20.209 --> 01:48:20.219 align:start position:0%
so if you were to break your leg during
 
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
that time period and you are not able to
 
01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
work you're not available to work you
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
are not eligible for unemployment
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
benefits during that time that you're
 
01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz well
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
because we
 
01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna say it I was just gonna I
 
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
I just don't think they need to earn
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
more we've already freaked them out with
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
all this all this stuff so far all the
 
01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
newbies I don't want to give them too
 
01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:49.850 align:start position:0%
newbies I don't want to give them too
much

01:48:49.850 --> 01:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as uh commissioner
 
01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
suswister said I've become kind of a
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
nerd about all this stuff so I'm sorry
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for the
 
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:03.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh and I think I asked you asked you
 
01:49:08.810 --> 01:49:08.820 align:start position:0%
this uh before but
 
01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
you know I'm concerned about the impact
 
01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:13.070 align:start position:0%
you know I'm concerned about the impact
um

01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
of those people who are ineligible as a
 
01:49:18.649 --> 01:49:18.659 align:start position:0%
result of the uh
 
01:49:21.169 --> 01:49:21.179 align:start position:0%
for instance during covet day care
 
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
center is closed their whole support
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
system went out from under them and many
 
01:49:28.129 --> 01:49:28.139 align:start position:0%
people had to leave their Workforce
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
and so the question I have did that
 
01:49:31.490 --> 01:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
impact women
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh female workers women workers as
 
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
opposed to male workers and what is the
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
what is the percentage of that I don't
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
expect you to answer that right now uh
 
01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
but I'd be interested in that because
 
01:49:45.530 --> 01:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
as we know the whole bottom fell out for
 
01:49:47.810 --> 01:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
so many people and those people are not
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
eligible in many cases for unemployment
 
01:49:52.970 --> 01:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
so the during the pandemic individuals
 
01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
that were that had been working or had
 
01:49:59.810 --> 01:49:59.820 align:start position:0%
been engaged in self-employment that
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
were no longer able to because of the
 
01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
pandemic they were eligible and they
 
01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
were filing including self-employed so
 
01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
if if
 
01:50:10.729 --> 01:50:10.739 align:start position:0%
fast forward to today you need to have a
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
qualifying separation meaning unemployed
 
01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
through no fault of your own you need to
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
have monetary eligibility meaning at
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
least twenty eight hundred dollars in
 
01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
your base period when covered employment
 
01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
and then you would be eligible for
 
01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:26.219 align:start position:0%
benefits experience during the pandemic
 
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
I can quickly answer that question so I
 
01:50:31.149 --> 01:50:31.159 align:start position:0%
don't have more homework
 
01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
during the height of the pandemic we're
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
from a gender breakdown we're looking
 
01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
about 60 female okay 60 of the people
 
01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
filing for unemployment benefits
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and the the pandemic related program
 
01:50:46.450 --> 01:50:46.460 align:start position:0%
were women
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
compare that to our most recent
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
recessionary period back in the Great
 
01:50:54.410 --> 01:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
Recession that was flipped so during the
 
01:50:57.649 --> 01:50:57.659 align:start position:0%
Great Recession it was 60 men the reason
 
01:50:59.330 --> 01:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
for both of those is because of the
 
01:51:01.129 --> 01:51:01.139 align:start position:0%
sectors that were impacted
 
01:51:03.649 --> 01:51:03.659 align:start position:0%
pandemic service sectors were much
 
01:51:06.770 --> 01:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
higher impacted those sectors have a
 
01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
higher percentage of female workers so
 
01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
your house your hospitality Health Care
 
01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:13.910 align:start position:0%
your house your hospitality Health Care
retail

01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
retail
 
01:51:15.649 --> 01:51:15.659 align:start position:0%
they have more female employees than
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
they do men
 
01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
they were more impacted during the
 
01:51:21.890 --> 01:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
pandemic hence more of the filers for
 
01:51:24.169 --> 01:51:24.179 align:start position:0%
unemployment being women Great Recession
 
01:51:26.590 --> 01:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
big impacts were in construction
 
01:51:29.810 --> 01:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
Financial Services manufacturing to a
 
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
certain degree those Industries tend to
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
be dominated by men so that's why there
 
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
were more men filing during the Great
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
Recession as compared to more women
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
filing during the pandemic recession
 
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
fast forward to where we are currently
 
01:51:45.649 --> 01:51:45.659 align:start position:0%
and looking at the groups that have been
 
01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
slow to return to the labor force I
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
believe we had looked at that broken
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
down by age cohort during the
 
01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:54.050 align:start position:0%
down by age cohort during the
orientation

01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
orientation
 
01:51:58.129 --> 01:51:58.139 align:start position:0%
and we've had a a drop in labor force
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
participation amongst our 25 to 34 year
 
01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:01.370 align:start position:0%
participation amongst our 25 to 34 year
olds

01:52:01.370 --> 01:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
olds
 
01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:02.570 align:start position:0%
olds
right

01:52:02.570 --> 01:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
um older workers have come back
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
um even exceeding their pre-pandemic
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
participation younger workers have not
 
01:52:13.010 --> 01:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
still off by five six percent which is
 
01:52:15.410 --> 01:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
why our labor force is still not yet
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
where it was prior to the pandemic when
 
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
you look at that 25 to 34 year old
 
01:52:22.609 --> 01:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
grouping that is more likely to have
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
young kids
 
01:52:28.010 --> 01:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
more of those individuals more women in
 
01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
that group have not come back to the
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
labor force as compared to men
 
01:52:36.590 --> 01:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
so the one can take that next step and
 
01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
say that the child care or lack thereof
 
01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
for that population who are most likely
 
01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
to and be in need of child care
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
those UH responsibilities tend to fall
 
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:51.659 align:start position:0%
more on female workers than they do male
 
01:52:54.129 --> 01:52:54.139 align:start position:0%
workers not in my household
 
01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
but generally they do
 
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
and you see a slower return to the labor
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
force amongst women 25 to 34 year old as
 
01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
compared to their male counterparts in
 
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions if you were
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
really kind of confused you can all feel
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
free to contact
 
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner on your own
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
I have four cards I'd like to get this
 
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
hearing in 30 minutes but I'm not going
 
01:53:31.609 --> 01:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
to stop anyone from uh from speaking

unemployment trust fund with coming up
 
01:53:49.689 --> 01:53:49.699 align:start position:0%
with a new mechanism what we use now
 
01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
it was a tough pill to swallow at the
 
01:53:54.770 --> 01:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
time increasing from 12 to 14 000 of
 
01:53:57.649 --> 01:53:57.659 align:start position:0%
benefits and putting a one-week delay in
 
01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
but that was pretty much your idea Gary
 
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
and that was a really difficult time
 
01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much Jim and infantine
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
for that uh yeah it was back in that uh
 
01:54:11.930 --> 01:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
recession in which the governor got a
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
number of business organizations
 
01:54:16.129 --> 01:54:16.139 align:start position:0%
including us how we're going to solve
 
01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
the problem and it included a tax rate
 
01:54:21.709 --> 01:54:21.719 align:start position:0%
for businesses and we phased it in but I
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I'm going to try to keep
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
my testimony short I know you're running
 
01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
on time in the commissioner has done
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
such an excellent job before me so part
 
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
of this comes that we did testify last
 
01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:37.860 align:start position:0%
year when a similar bill was in place we
 
01:54:40.669 --> 01:54:40.679 align:start position:0%
were in opposition let me introduce
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
myself from Gary Abbott the Executive
 
01:54:45.890 --> 01:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
Vice President of the associated general
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
contractors of New Hampshire I represent
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
large commercial contractors both
 
01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
building and Highway
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh this bill last year I brought a
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
highway contractor with me because this
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
is really I did a quick survey last year
 
01:55:05.169 --> 01:55:05.179 align:start position:0%
based on the sponsor asking me to do so
 
01:55:08.270 --> 01:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
of how many weeks for seasonal and I
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
represent uh I have construction firms
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
that do less than you know uh they have
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
different ranges so I didn't I did a
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
quick survey and I came down to what I
 
01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
got responses back is uh 16 to 20 weeks
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
so I got different companies responding
 
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
that would be adequate and you can
 
01:55:32.090 --> 01:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
imagine Paving was at the entire number
 
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
of 20 because Paving is temperature
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
related and they can be shut down
 
01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
earlier than other construction firms
 
01:55:44.090 --> 01:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
and unlike Florida we have Winters here
 
01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
and they can't work
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
so they were concerned that you know no
 
01:55:51.890 --> 01:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
fault of their own of an individual that
 
01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
works for them gets laid off qualifies
 
01:55:58.129 --> 01:55:58.139 align:start position:0%
because keep in mind our time period
 
01:56:01.010 --> 01:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
goes for those layoffs typically more
 
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
than 14 weeks so they have to look for
 
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
work they have to do all of that and
 
01:56:08.510 --> 01:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
there is no guarantee you do have
 
01:56:10.490 --> 01:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
construction firms that might not be
 
01:56:12.910 --> 01:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
able to go back into work the next year
 
01:56:16.729 --> 01:56:16.739 align:start position:0%
this may be not a seasonal layoff it may
 
01:56:18.290 --> 01:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
be permanent so that's why it's
 
01:56:21.290 --> 01:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
structured the way it is that a person's
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
eligible there's an intent to come back
 
01:56:26.810 --> 01:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
to work but as you know some employees
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
that go on unemployment might find a job
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and may never come back to
 
01:56:33.590 --> 01:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
construction so it's a reality that we
 
01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
live with
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
so we just want to protect we want as
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
much of our Workforce to come back as we
 
01:56:42.050 --> 01:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
possibly can now keep in mind
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner talked about the amount
 
01:56:47.209 --> 01:56:47.219 align:start position:0%
the amount is not anywhere near the
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
wages that they could earn but there is
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
a difficulty if you're in the paving
 
01:56:55.729 --> 01:56:55.739 align:start position:0%
industry and you have expert in that
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
and you tell an employer that you're
 
01:56:58.910 --> 01:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
trying to go to work for that you're
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
probably most likely will go back to
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
work in the paving industry in the
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
spring it makes it much more difficult
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
if you're honest with those other
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
employers that you're going to go to a
 
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
different job and that may hurt you
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get the job but trying to be
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
honest with that so one of the things we
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
came down with and last year we opposed
 
01:57:20.810 --> 01:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
it but I think we got a lot of
 
01:57:22.609 --> 01:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
information and I know the commissioner
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
talked about facts and figures one thing
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
we took away from last year
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
and you can see that we kind of looked
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
and counted weeks and we said
 
01:57:33.169 --> 01:57:33.179 align:start position:0%
we really if you were going to start
 
01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
this phase-in of what the bill and we're
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
not opposed to the concept of the bill
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
because I think there's a Gap a curve
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
beyond the average and we got this from
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
the Deputy Commissioner last year the
 
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
bulk of the unemployment goes away in 17
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
weeks so I looked at my numbers of 16 to
 
01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
20 talked to the contractors and said if
 
01:57:58.129 --> 01:57:58.139 align:start position:0%
that curve
 
01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
17 weeks a much higher than a majority
 
01:58:04.129 --> 01:58:04.139 align:start position:0%
come off because you probably have the
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
seasonal that's part of those numbers of
 
01:58:09.290 --> 01:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
the past before covet and one of the
 
01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
things with covid we did as construction
 
01:58:13.970 --> 01:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
industry continue to work through copen
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
so even when covet was hit in the
 
01:58:19.370 --> 01:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
construction season we kept our people
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
employed but what we basically said if
 
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
there was going to be a phase in to look
 
01:58:26.089 --> 01:58:26.099 align:start position:0%
at those people that are going all the
 
01:58:28.010 --> 01:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
way to the end because that's really I
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
think what the bill is trying to do we
 
01:58:33.050 --> 01:58:33.060 align:start position:0%
understand that as a policy but we think
 
01:58:36.050 --> 01:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
the 14 weeks should start with a 17-week
 
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
and if that's the more than the majority
 
01:58:41.810 --> 01:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
you know this kind of bell curve that
 
01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
was the big number last year that we
 
01:58:47.709 --> 01:58:47.719 align:start position:0%
heard from the the unemployment security
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
that's why we recommended 17 weeks
 
01:58:52.609 --> 01:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
because if you go beyond that then you
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
have that policy but we would leave that
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
up to the committee but we think 14
 
01:58:58.970 --> 01:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
weeks is too short
 
01:59:02.089 --> 01:59:02.099 align:start position:0%
and with that I would end my testimony I
 
01:59:03.890 --> 01:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
think you've heard an awful lot of facts
 
01:59:07.129 --> 01:59:07.139 align:start position:0%
and figures and I'm just here to support
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh if you were to go forward with that
 
01:59:11.810 --> 01:59:11.820 align:start position:0%
policy change
 
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
try to make it to the 17 weeks
 
01:59:17.570 --> 01:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cahill
 
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
Abbott for taking my question I I tended
 
01:59:24.649 --> 01:59:24.659 align:start position:0%
to uh I listened to what the Deputy
 
01:59:26.209 --> 01:59:26.219 align:start position:0%
Commissioner labor said and I I think
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
that's what we have is working fine I I
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't really see
 
01:59:33.169 --> 01:59:33.179 align:start position:0%
they need a benefit to change it but as
 
01:59:35.089 --> 01:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
knowing that your Devotion to the trust
 
01:59:35.099 --> 01:59:35.990 align:start position:0%
knowing that your Devotion to the trust
fund

01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh I wanted to ask you about you know
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
as you know when when you have seasonal
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
labor is if you pay them their their two
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
weeks vacation
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
that Shields the trust fund from two
 
01:59:49.729 --> 01:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
weeks of benefits and I'd imagine in the
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
construction field that you might be at
 
01:59:52.970 --> 01:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
the Forty one thousand five hundred
 
01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
which would be forty four twenty seven a
 
01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:56.689 align:start position:0%
which would be forty four twenty seven a
week

01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:59:59.089 --> 01:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
is that would that be would that be a
 
02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
way of shielding of protecting the trust
 
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
fund while ensuring that you're you know
 
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
employees had a full week's pay for each
 
02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:08.699 align:start position:0%
of those vacations I I guess what I
 
02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
don't want to mix
 
02:00:13.250 --> 02:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
companies develop their own policies
 
02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
regarding vacation sick pay whether they
 
02:00:18.649 --> 02:00:18.659 align:start position:0%
handle health care through a layoff
 
02:00:22.370 --> 02:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of policy decisions I
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
think on this bill we're at least for me
 
02:00:27.169 --> 02:00:27.179 align:start position:0%
I'm focused on
 
02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
if they're eligible how does it work and
 
02:00:31.970 --> 02:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
how many weeks based on what we have
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
today I can't tell you every company how
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
that you know if they're paid I agree
 
02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
with the Department in the sense that
 
02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
those are how the regulations go and we
 
02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
conform to that no difference than years
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
ago when they changed we used to not
 
02:00:50.750 --> 02:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
have to look for work many many years
 
02:00:52.910 --> 02:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
ago but the legislature and the
 
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
department changed that so we look for
 
02:00:56.689 --> 02:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
work just like anybody else which I
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
think is fair
 
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
oh yeah there's two hours I do
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
understand that your workers are
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
probably looking for work because
 
02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
there's quite a gap between you know 30
 
02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
you know you're missing 370 dollars and
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'd be looking for that someplace so I
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
understand your people are probably
 
02:01:14.570 --> 02:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
working where they can
 
02:01:17.089 --> 02:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I just want to play not
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
everyone that works for a seasonal
 
02:01:22.129 --> 02:01:22.139 align:start position:0%
worker a seasonal company
 
02:01:23.930 --> 02:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
goes on unemployment
 
02:01:27.050 --> 02:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
they may do some other work and not do
 
02:01:28.729 --> 02:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
that because they don't want to have to
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
look for work and all those other things
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it's a an absolute but
 
02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
somebody who absolutely needs the money
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
and actually is looking for work then
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
they'll go into the system
 
02:01:41.689 --> 02:01:41.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
so any other questions thank you Mr
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
Abbott thank you
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr McKenzie go ahead
 
02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
and see your hand
 
02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:51.950 align:start position:0%
and see your hand
um

02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
so the model that you're describing
 
02:01:57.169 --> 02:01:57.179 align:start position:0%
um where people go on uh seasonal
 
02:01:57.179 --> 02:01:58.669 align:start position:0%
um where people go on uh seasonal
workers

02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
workers
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's a very different model than what
 
02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:04.679 align:start position:0%
the union Workforce uh has
 
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
in that if you acknowledge this that
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
there is a difference between a hiring
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
Hall and what and what you do and the
 
02:02:14.689 --> 02:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
because they are always looking for work
 
02:02:17.089 --> 02:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
in the labor in the union side of it you
 
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
represent I think some Union contractors
 
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
as well so is that so it it there's a
 
02:02:24.589 --> 02:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
difference between those two
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
those two environment those two models I
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
think what you're saying is is not
 
02:02:29.639 --> 02:02:31.250 align:start position:0%
think what you're saying is is not
necessarily

02:02:31.250 --> 02:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
02:02:33.470 --> 02:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
um because I think even if you're a
 
02:02:35.689 --> 02:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
union Highway that has seasonal work you
 
02:02:38.209 --> 02:02:38.219 align:start position:0%
would end up in that same situation even
 
02:02:39.530 --> 02:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
though you were Union because I do
 
02:02:41.689 --> 02:02:41.699 align:start position:0%
represent some Union firms so I don't
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
think it would be different a lot of the
 
02:02:45.410 --> 02:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
model for construction though is looking
 
02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
at building construction and you may
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
work on a project that ends you don't
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
know when it's going to start again
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
could be within but I don't think
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's guarantees for the Department to
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
say you don't have to look for work so I
 
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
I don't think the model you know I have
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
to look at I do represent this bigger
 
02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
umbrella it's not just this one many uh
 
02:03:09.410 --> 02:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
companies will won't use you know the
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
whole period of time because there'll be
 
02:03:13.970 --> 02:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
another project but it varies whether
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're Union or open shop but it still
 
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
is you could be left without a job for a
 
02:03:23.450 --> 02:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Robert thank you
 
02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
and next I like to call Roy swaker
 
02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
representing himself thank you welcome
 
02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
to the labor committee
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
committee I'm back here again after last
 
02:03:42.890 --> 02:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
year and essentially I have a very
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
similar thing to say namely that uh
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
we need to think of these as people and
 
02:03:50.089 --> 02:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
not as statistics I mean you could
 
02:03:52.070 --> 02:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
easily you know cut the thing by
 
02:03:54.649 --> 02:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
eliminating benefits to two weeks and
 
02:03:56.089 --> 02:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
you of course then you'd also get 100
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
exhaustion because no one's going to
 
02:04:00.649 --> 02:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
find a new job in two weeks but anyway
 
02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
I what I'd like you to think about is
 
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
why are these people still not working
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
in 26 weeks I mean some people have been
 
02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
thinking about that I think that we had
 
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
the construction model talked about I
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
think that what you need to do is can
 
02:04:16.669 --> 02:04:16.679 align:start position:0%
you bifurcate that that people that work
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
in certain sectors the employer just pay
 
02:04:20.689 --> 02:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
enough to keep their that part of the
 
02:04:22.729 --> 02:04:22.739 align:start position:0%
trust fund solvent so you're not worried
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
about that running out and then you know
 
02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
leave the people that are not in
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
seasonal work to kind of have their own
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
part of the trust fund if these
 
02:04:31.129 --> 02:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
companies are really paying enough money
 
02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
for their seasonal workers then fine
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
what do we care if they're uh for 20
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
weeks if that's the way that that
 
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
industry wants to operate
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
and so and that's the first thing I want
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
to say the second thing it has to do
 
02:04:46.850 --> 02:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
with uh last year my complaint was that
 
02:04:49.010 --> 02:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Works was only open
 
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
half of the day and they've cured that
 
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
they're back to a full day and they've
 
02:04:56.570 --> 02:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
also come up with this new uh job portal
 
02:04:59.330 --> 02:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
which I sent you some slides about I
 
02:05:00.649 --> 02:05:00.659 align:start position:0%
don't know how many people bothered to
 
02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
look at them yet but this job portal to
 
02:05:04.850 --> 02:05:04.860 align:start position:0%
me looks like it's designed to help
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
people that don't want to go back to
 
02:05:08.209 --> 02:05:08.219 align:start position:0%
work and it makes it worse for the
 
02:05:10.129 --> 02:05:10.139 align:start position:0%
people that actually want a job
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
because if you look at it
 
02:05:14.930 --> 02:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
you know you can select types of work
 
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
you can select areas and so forth but
 
02:05:19.129 --> 02:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
then what you get is a list of jobs in
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
that area
 
02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
and apparently this is not particularly
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
attractive to employers because I notice
 
02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
in concrete which is what I looked at
 
02:05:28.669 --> 02:05:28.679 align:start position:0%
there was no big box stores in the list
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
is that really true that no big box
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
stores in Concord are looking for help
 
02:05:35.089 --> 02:05:35.099 align:start position:0%
or is it just this job portal is not
 
02:05:36.649 --> 02:05:36.659 align:start position:0%
useful to them so they don't bother
 
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
listing their jobs on it but the more
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
interesting thing that about this job
 
02:05:43.070 --> 02:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
portal is there's both a link on the
 
02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:45.719 align:start position:0%
left with the job title and a link on
 
02:05:48.530 --> 02:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
the right inquire and they both bring up
 
02:05:51.709 --> 02:05:51.719 align:start position:0%
the same page on that page you have 200
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
characters to explain why you want this
 
02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:54.950 align:start position:0%
characters to explain why you want this
job

02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
job
 
02:05:57.850 --> 02:05:57.860 align:start position:0%
and you know it's 200 characters enough
 
02:06:01.070 --> 02:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
and but what you don't get in this
 
02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
unlike most job sites you don't get a
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
description of what the job entails you
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
don't get a description of the
 
02:06:08.570 --> 02:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
requirements you don't get a you know
 
02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
indication of what to pay on that job is
 
02:06:13.609 --> 02:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
so you know here you're applying for a
 
02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
job and 200 characters that you really
 
02:06:17.209 --> 02:06:17.219 align:start position:0%
know nothing about
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
and it says well the employer will get
 
02:06:20.209 --> 02:06:20.219 align:start position:0%
back to you if you're interested you
 
02:06:21.649 --> 02:06:21.659 align:start position:0%
know that doesn't sound very reasonable
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
to me and the example I picked there was
 
02:06:26.810 --> 02:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
a licensing examiner too from the state
 
02:06:28.970 --> 02:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
I mean that's a job there should be a
 
02:06:31.129 --> 02:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
job description for it there should be a
 
02:06:32.689 --> 02:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
pay scale for it but they're not
 
02:06:34.669 --> 02:06:34.679 align:start position:0%
available the only way to find it is to
 
02:06:36.890 --> 02:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
go to the state and website and try and
 
02:06:38.689 --> 02:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
track it down separately it should just
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
be on one of those clickable links
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
and then you know the 200 characters I
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
could say well I worked at a convenience
 
02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
store and I used to have to examine
 
02:06:47.629 --> 02:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
licenses to see if they were old enough
 
02:06:49.550 --> 02:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
to buy cigarettes it's not qualified to
 
02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
be as a licensing examiner well maybe it
 
02:06:53.209 --> 02:06:53.219 align:start position:0%
does maybe it doesn't I have no clue
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what that job
 
02:06:54.719 --> 02:06:56.209 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what that job
involves

02:06:56.209 --> 02:06:56.219 align:start position:0%
involves
 
02:06:56.219 --> 02:06:57.530 align:start position:0%
involves
and

02:06:57.530 --> 02:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
so I really think that you know we need
 
02:07:03.290 --> 02:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
to find a system whereby people that are
 
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
unemployed for a long time can get
 
02:07:08.089 --> 02:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
matched up with jobs they can do I think
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
that you know that's something that
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
let's let the Department of Employment
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
Security come up with a better program
 
02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
the people that are still filing after
 
02:07:18.770 --> 02:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
10 weeks maybe speak to them personally
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
find out how come they're still looking
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
speak to the employers find out why that
 
02:07:25.609 --> 02:07:25.619 align:start position:0%
job is still there you know see if maybe
 
02:07:26.990 --> 02:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
you can match some of these people up
 
02:07:29.390 --> 02:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
because I mean that's really what we
 
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
need is put these people back to work
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I want to respond to
 
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
is something that representative
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
turcotte said about anybody can make 20
 
02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
bucks an hour if they want to and the
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
answer is well maybe and maybe not I
 
02:07:43.010 --> 02:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
volunteer for a group that is unemployed
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
Sports unemployed people I would say
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
most of those people would love to take
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
a 20 an hour job if they could find it
 
02:07:50.570 --> 02:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
if you grew up Senator turcott probably
 
02:07:52.010 --> 02:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
has greater skills than most of them and
 
02:07:53.450 --> 02:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
that's probably he doesn't struggle with
 
02:07:55.609 --> 02:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
most of them will and as far as the guy
 
02:07:57.530 --> 02:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
who is the
 
02:07:59.330 --> 02:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
heavy equipment operator in the North
 
02:08:01.970 --> 02:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
country and can't find a job in the
 
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
winter well maybe there's plenty of jobs
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
down in Dover but how's he going to
 
02:08:07.609 --> 02:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
afford to move down to Dover for six
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
months to get it I mean if you have a
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
job that pays twenty dollars an hour
 
02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
then you figure at 30 percent of your
 
02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
income for an apartment you need to be
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
able to run an apartment for a thousand
 
02:08:18.410 --> 02:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
dollars a month
 
02:08:20.689 --> 02:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
so maybe representative turcott's got a
 
02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
bunch of jobs to pay twenty dollars an
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
hour and notice where the people can run
 
02:08:25.490 --> 02:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
an apartment for a thousand dollars a
 
02:08:29.450 --> 02:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
month but somehow I doubt it thank you
 
02:08:30.530 --> 02:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
any questions from Mr schweiker
 
02:08:39.410 --> 02:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:44.990 --> 02:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
apologies I think Ray and I actually
 
02:08:48.890 --> 02:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
both submitted cards by accident there
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
we got our wires crossed but I'm Stephen
 
02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
Tower from nhla I believe I'm the other
 
02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:54.350 align:start position:0%
Tower from nhla I believe I'm the other
card

02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
card
 
02:08:58.070 --> 02:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
I see okay you're Stephen yes and you're
 
02:09:01.070 --> 02:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
gonna are you and Raven going to testify
 
02:09:03.410 --> 02:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
together okay
 
02:09:05.209 --> 02:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a confusion this morning
 
02:09:07.729 --> 02:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
no worries
 
02:09:09.890 --> 02:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
um good morning Mr chairman members of
 
02:09:12.290 --> 02:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
the committee um I think my job will be
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
pretty easy today I believe the Deputy
 
02:09:15.649 --> 02:09:15.659 align:start position:0%
Commissioner covered most of what I was
 
02:09:18.350 --> 02:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
going to talk to you about today I did
 
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
want to just touch on a couple other
 
02:09:22.189 --> 02:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
points that
 
02:09:22.199 --> 02:09:23.089 align:start position:0%
points that
um

02:09:23.089 --> 02:09:23.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:27.229 --> 02:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
I I think could be emphasized so
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
over the last two years I've lost track
 
02:09:30.770 --> 02:09:30.780 align:start position:0%
of how many times I've heard somebody
 
02:09:32.930 --> 02:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
say well it's just that nobody wants to
 
02:09:35.330 --> 02:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
work anymore you know people are taking
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
advantage of the unemployment system and
 
02:09:39.530 --> 02:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
they just want to stay home and sit on
 
02:09:41.149 --> 02:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
the couch and eat bon bons and watch TV
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
and I think uh in large part uh the
 
02:09:46.490 --> 02:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner's testimony uh
 
02:09:48.290 --> 02:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
showed with uh some of the data that he
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
provided that that's not necessarily the
 
02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
case and I just wanted to emphasize a
 
02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
few other things about that
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
um so the current average weekly benefit
 
02:10:01.129 --> 02:10:01.139 align:start position:0%
rate that is paid is uh 356 per week
 
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
um and uh that comes out to about 15 30
 
02:10:06.290 --> 02:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
per month
 
02:10:09.649 --> 02:10:09.659 align:start position:0%
um and as the Deputy Commissioner
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the wage replacement rate
 
02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
for the the is about 30 so they're
 
02:10:16.910 --> 02:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
getting a when when somebody is
 
02:10:18.530 --> 02:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
separated from their employment through
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
no fault of their own they're
 
02:10:22.430 --> 02:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
essentially getting a 70 pay cut while
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
they're on unemployment
 
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
um and that 15 30 the average rate that
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
people receive
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
um is hard to live on that per month
 
02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
um right now the average rent for a one
 
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
bedroom apartment in Manchester is
 
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
sixteen hundred so if somebody is
 
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
earning the average Unemployment uh
 
02:10:44.689 --> 02:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit rate uh and they live in
 
02:10:47.089 --> 02:10:47.099 align:start position:0%
the Manchester area they couldn't afford
 
02:10:50.570 --> 02:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
rent never mind food utilities gas any
 
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
other bills that they have
 
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
um so uh the the unemployment
 
02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
benefits that they receive help
 
02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
keep them from complete Financial ruin
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
but they are not living comfortably
 
02:11:04.250 --> 02:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
sitting home
 
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
eating bon bons
 
02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:07.609 align:start position:0%
eating bon bons
um

02:11:07.609 --> 02:11:07.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:07.619 --> 02:11:08.930 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:10.430 align:start position:0%
the
uh

02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:13.850 --> 02:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
there is some discussion about the
 
02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
individual in the North Country who is
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
enjoying his 26 weeks of unemployment
 
02:11:21.709 --> 02:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
each year
 
02:11:21.719 --> 02:11:22.370 align:start position:0%
each year
um

02:11:22.370 --> 02:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
presumably or allegedly
 
02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
so as a reminder when someone is
 
02:11:29.330 --> 02:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
receiving unemployment benefits they are
 
02:11:31.729 --> 02:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
somebody who up until recently was
 
02:11:34.370 --> 02:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
dutifully working and earning income
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
they had been working enough to generate
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
enough earnings in their uh base period
 
02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
to establish their weekly benefit rate
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
and through no fault of their own they
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
become unemployed while they are
 
02:11:49.729 --> 02:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
receiving benefits they have to search
 
02:11:51.290 --> 02:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
for work they have to weekly report
 
02:11:53.330 --> 02:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
where they have search for work with
 
02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
information about the employers that
 
02:11:57.169 --> 02:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
they've contacted they have to remain
 
02:11:59.149 --> 02:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
able and available and certified of that
 
02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
and they have to certify to their job
 
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
search requirements the department
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
regularly audits some amount of those
 
02:12:09.229 --> 02:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
job search reports and
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
um they in each of their offices across
 
02:12:14.410 --> 02:12:14.420 align:start position:0%
the state they have big bold posters up
 
02:12:16.669 --> 02:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
declaring their successful fraud
 
02:12:18.169 --> 02:12:18.179 align:start position:0%
convictions for people that they catch
 
02:12:20.450 --> 02:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
lying on any of these certifications who
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
have been falsely collecting
 
02:12:25.250 --> 02:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits so there there are
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
real things that people have to do to
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
receive this unemployment benefits and
 
02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
one of those things is if they find
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
available work or they are offered
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
suitable work they have to take it they
 
02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
can't choose to to sit on unemployment
 
02:12:40.370 --> 02:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
and not take a job that's offered to
 
02:12:40.380 --> 02:12:42.410 align:start position:0%
and not take a job that's offered to
them

02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:44.149 align:start position:0%
them
um

02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
so given that there's uh only about
 
02:12:49.850 --> 02:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
eight percent of people currently
 
02:12:53.330 --> 02:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
exhausting their unemployment benefits
 
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
um there may be a question of well it's
 
02:12:57.229 --> 02:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
such a small number if we reduce the
 
02:12:59.089 --> 02:12:59.099 align:start position:0%
number of weeks it's only affecting a
 
02:13:00.410 --> 02:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
small portion of the people receiving
 
02:13:03.649 --> 02:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits but each person in
 
02:13:05.810 --> 02:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
that eight percent is a New Hampshire
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
resident who has a real life and real
 
02:13:10.010 --> 02:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
reasons and
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
um the Deputy Commissioner testified
 
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
some of those are people who are going
 
02:13:16.669 --> 02:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
through the job training program I know
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
um personally when I was a child my
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
father had worked at a business a
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
warehouse in Massachusetts for 25 years
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
and got laid off and because of the type
 
02:13:26.930 --> 02:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
of work he was doing there weren't
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
really jobs that he could just go out
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
and find another job like that so he
 
02:13:32.589 --> 02:13:32.599 align:start position:0%
went through the Massachusetts program
 
02:13:35.810 --> 02:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
and uh went through job training and
 
02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
learned new job skills and that was a
 
02:13:40.490 --> 02:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
process for him the other folks who at
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
nhla that we see frequently who
 
02:13:46.490 --> 02:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
likely need longer to find jobs than the
 
02:13:50.510 --> 02:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
general 10 weeks average are people with
 
02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
caregiving responsibilities that may
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
have only been available to work second
 
02:13:58.250 --> 02:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
shift or third shift and you know their
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
work search is limited to trying to find
 
02:14:03.050 --> 02:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
work that suits their uh their child
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
care needs also
 
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps people who have substantial
 
02:14:11.089 --> 02:14:11.099 align:start position:0%
disabilities that make them harder to
 
02:14:12.410 --> 02:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
hire a less
 
02:14:16.089 --> 02:14:16.099 align:start position:0%
less attractive to employers because of
 
02:14:19.550 --> 02:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
the the difficulties that that
 
02:14:21.290 --> 02:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
individual may have in completing a lot
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
of tasks and then there's a lot of data
 
02:14:26.930 --> 02:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
out there that shows that older workers
 
02:14:30.290 --> 02:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
on average uh have a noticeably
 
02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
statistically relevant longer period of
 
02:14:35.629 --> 02:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
being on unemployment and I think that a
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
lot of that goes to bias that may exist
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
that somebody towards the end of their
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
working career may not be able to accept
 
02:14:46.729 --> 02:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
and and take on you know new skills and
 
02:14:49.609 --> 02:14:49.619 align:start position:0%
new new tasks and then there's there's
 
02:14:52.609 --> 02:14:52.619 align:start position:0%
also not maybe not an unreasonable
 
02:14:55.310 --> 02:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
concern from an employer of well this
 
02:14:57.649 --> 02:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
person was recently became unemployed in
 
02:14:59.450 --> 02:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
their 65 how much longer are they going
 
02:15:01.129 --> 02:15:01.139 align:start position:0%
to work for my company am I going to
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
hire them and then two and a half years
 
02:15:05.330 --> 02:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
later they decide to retire and I have
 
02:15:07.609 --> 02:15:07.619 align:start position:0%
to find and train a new employee so
 
02:15:09.530 --> 02:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
there are barriers that make it harder
 
02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
for older workers to to find jobs
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
particularly jobs that are are relevant
 
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
to what they had been doing in the past
 
02:15:21.470 --> 02:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
and this bill would affect all of these
 
02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
sorts of people who may take longer
 
02:15:26.089 --> 02:15:26.099 align:start position:0%
periods of time to find work I think
 
02:15:27.649 --> 02:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
everything else I had planned on saying
 
02:15:29.209 --> 02:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
the deputy Commissioners testified too
 
02:15:31.010 --> 02:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave it at that if anyone has
 
02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:44.890 --> 02:15:44.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:47.450 --> 02:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in the previous week I
 
02:15:49.609 --> 02:15:49.619 align:start position:0%
mentioned also the the network of
 
02:15:52.729 --> 02:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
support uh our job opportunities for the
 
02:15:54.770 --> 02:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
Job Corps and all those other things and
 
02:15:56.330 --> 02:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
yet we as a committee don't talk a whole
 
02:15:59.089 --> 02:15:59.099 align:start position:0%
lot about that so when you when you look
 
02:16:01.609 --> 02:16:01.619 align:start position:0%
at the workers of the Unemployment uh
 
02:16:04.129 --> 02:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
compensation do you ever take a look at
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
that system and the benefits that that
 
02:16:08.510 --> 02:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
system provides because we don't talk
 
02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
about it a whole lot here I mean there
 
02:16:12.770 --> 02:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
is support for unemployed workers get
 
02:16:14.930 --> 02:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
them back to work and there's all kinds
 
02:16:16.669 --> 02:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
of programs that they're available to
 
02:16:16.679 --> 02:16:17.689 align:start position:0%
of programs that they're available to
them

02:16:17.689 --> 02:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:16:21.169 --> 02:16:21.179 align:start position:0%
um so in our work we do have some
 
02:16:23.930 --> 02:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
individuals again we represent
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
specifically low-income workers who are
 
02:16:27.890 --> 02:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
having issues with unemployment and we
 
02:16:30.109 --> 02:16:30.119 align:start position:0%
do see some people who are in job
 
02:16:31.609 --> 02:16:31.619 align:start position:0%
training programs
 
02:16:31.619 --> 02:16:32.209 align:start position:0%
training programs
um

02:16:32.209 --> 02:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the job training programs
 
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
that are out there are for people who
 
02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
um because of the the field that they
 
02:16:43.730 --> 02:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
worked in or the length of time that
 
02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
they've been looking for work May
 
02:16:49.250 --> 02:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
have a harder time finding work without
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
going through a program and learning new
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
skills and a lot of our clients we don't
 
02:16:56.750 --> 02:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
see that I have definitely had a couple
 
02:16:58.610 --> 02:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
clients who have been in the the
 
02:17:02.929 --> 02:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
training programs what we do frequently
 
02:17:05.929 --> 02:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
see at nhla is one of the other areas
 
02:17:08.330 --> 02:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
that we work in are disability claims
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
and disability appeals
 
02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:11.410 align:start position:0%
and disability appeals
um

02:17:11.410 --> 02:17:11.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
and uh the New Hampshire employment
 
02:17:16.730 --> 02:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
security has programs in place for
 
02:17:18.410 --> 02:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
people who
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
um are disabled who maybe have filed for
 
02:17:23.810 --> 02:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
disability and either received it or
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
didn't receive it but they want to try
 
02:17:29.150 --> 02:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
to get back into the workforce and the
 
02:17:31.490 --> 02:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
department provides
 
02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.469 align:start position:0%
department provides
um

02:17:32.469 --> 02:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities to try to find out what
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
the their disability limitations are and
 
02:17:40.669 --> 02:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
find work that works around those
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities and that those disabilities
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:47.519 --> 02:17:48.889 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:17:48.889 --> 02:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:51.290 --> 02:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
um if I can one more point that I forgot
 
02:17:52.669 --> 02:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
to mention earlier
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
um uh representative turcotte mentioned
 
02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:56.089 align:start position:0%
um uh representative turcotte mentioned
Florida

02:17:56.089 --> 02:17:56.099 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
um and and described Florida and and
 
02:18:00.889 --> 02:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
some of the the ways that their
 
02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
unemployment program works down there
 
02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:03.290 align:start position:0%
unemployment program works down there
and

02:18:03.290 --> 02:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
um for folks who may not have seen it
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic there were a lot of
 
02:18:11.450 --> 02:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
news stories about how
 
02:18:14.089 --> 02:18:14.099 align:start position:0%
um Florida's unemployment system was a
 
02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
mess in a lot of ways both the
 
02:18:18.110 --> 02:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
administration of the program and the
 
02:18:19.969 --> 02:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
fact that the limited number of weeks
 
02:18:21.650 --> 02:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
that we're eligible for down there
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
people were exhausting their benefits
 
02:18:25.490 --> 02:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes it took them six months to get
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
their benefits but when they exhausted
 
02:18:30.290 --> 02:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
their benefits they very quickly
 
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
still were in a position of being unable
 
02:18:33.889 --> 02:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
to return to work during the height of
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
that pandemic and had no support
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
um and on the other hand while it was
 
02:18:43.969 --> 02:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
certainly a a difficult time for all
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
states running their unemployment
 
02:18:47.570 --> 02:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
programs during the pandemic I think
 
02:18:50.750 --> 02:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
nhla broadly is pretty impressed with
 
02:18:55.250 --> 02:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
the way nags managed that disaster and I
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
I just you know I I just want to say
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
that I don't think
 
02:19:01.009 --> 02:19:01.019 align:start position:0%
it's in New Hampshire's best interest to
 
02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
try to emulate Florida's unemployment
 
02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:04.610 align:start position:0%
try to emulate Florida's unemployment
program

02:19:04.610 --> 02:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:19:06.889 --> 02:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
I think we do a pretty good job here
 
02:19:09.410 --> 02:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions thank you
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%

dessert

03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
I would like to open the hearing on
 
03:05:23.210 --> 03:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
House Bill 232
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
call the prime sponsor representative
 
03:05:27.110 --> 03:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
Brian Sullivan
 
03:05:32.870 --> 03:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:37.389 --> 03:05:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:40.429 --> 03:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
the current state of a long process that
 
03:05:41.690 --> 03:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with dealing with
 
03:05:43.870 --> 03:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
public sector ownership
 
03:05:47.090 --> 03:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
it started with a bill that I filed four
 
03:05:48.170 --> 03:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:05:52.910 --> 03:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
which would have created a state plan
 
03:05:58.309 --> 03:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
public sector oship that state plan is a
 
03:06:00.130 --> 03:06:00.140 align:start position:0%
very involved process
 
03:06:03.910 --> 03:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
I think at the time not only the
 
03:06:06.530 --> 03:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
complexity of the developing estate plan
 
03:06:09.170 --> 03:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
was an issue but also there are a lot of
 
03:06:12.530 --> 03:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions that were an issue
 
03:06:12.540 --> 03:06:13.670 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions that were an issue
um

03:06:13.670 --> 03:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:16.250 --> 03:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
and so uh
 
03:06:19.130 --> 03:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
in in the end it did pass the house it
 
03:06:20.389 --> 03:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate but the governor
 
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
vetoed it
 
03:06:22.080 --> 03:06:22.910 align:start position:0%
vetoed it
um

03:06:22.910 --> 03:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
the following session
 
03:06:26.399 --> 03:06:27.050 align:start position:0%
the following session
um

03:06:27.050 --> 03:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
I had an epiphany
 
03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
that perhaps rather than just trying to
 
03:06:34.969 --> 03:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
blast the thing through maybe we ought
 
03:06:37.790 --> 03:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
to answer those unanswered questions
 
03:06:42.050 --> 03:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
um so the next bill I proposed was a to
 
03:06:44.990 --> 03:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
create a study committee to
 
03:06:47.929 --> 03:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
um to study what it would take to create
 
03:06:50.269 --> 03:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
a state plan for public sector roadship
 
03:06:52.790 --> 03:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
and I did bring copies of the report
 
03:06:59.929 --> 03:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:59.939 --> 03:07:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:07:08.750 --> 03:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:10.849 --> 03:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
how come we didn't get her around no
 
03:07:13.070 --> 03:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
holder so if I could put these people in
 
03:07:21.110 --> 03:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:24.170 --> 03:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
I I had envisioned that the
 
03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the committee would
 
03:07:27.120 --> 03:07:27.889 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the committee would
be

03:07:27.889 --> 03:07:27.899 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:07:27.899 --> 03:07:29.510 align:start position:0%
be
um

03:07:29.510 --> 03:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:31.429 --> 03:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
to create a state plan for public sector
 
03:07:31.439 --> 03:07:34.490 align:start position:0%
to create a state plan for public sector
oship

03:07:34.490 --> 03:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:36.469 --> 03:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
with all those unanswered questions
 
03:07:39.530 --> 03:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
being filled in that is not what the
 
03:07:41.630 --> 03:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
committee ended up doing
 
03:07:44.510 --> 03:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
um and I will say that I'm perfectly
 
03:07:47.210 --> 03:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
happy with what the committee did
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and we managed to have a unanimous
 
03:07:52.750 --> 03:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
decision out of that committee we had
 
03:07:55.030 --> 03:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
the chairman was on the committee
 
03:07:57.590 --> 03:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative avalani from this
 
03:07:59.210 --> 03:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
committee was also on the study
 
03:08:02.210 --> 03:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
committee as was Senator Kevin Kavanaugh
 
03:08:04.070 --> 03:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
and myself
 
03:08:07.570 --> 03:08:07.580 align:start position:0%
um and in the end what we agreed to do
 
03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
was create a bill which is House Bill
 
03:08:14.809 --> 03:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
232 that would
 
03:08:17.090 --> 03:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
come short of creating the plan but
 
03:08:19.429 --> 03:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
would adopt the
 
03:08:21.849 --> 03:08:21.859 align:start position:0%
um the OSHA safety standards
 
03:08:26.090 --> 03:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
specifically the 1910 standards into New
 
03:08:27.349 --> 03:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
03:08:30.349 --> 03:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
so just like all the private sector
 
03:08:32.450 --> 03:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
workers in New Hampshire
 
03:08:35.690 --> 03:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
the public sector workers would be um
 
03:08:38.090 --> 03:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
covered by the same set of safety
 
03:08:40.429 --> 03:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
standards I remember at the signing
 
03:08:42.349 --> 03:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
ceremony the governor indicated that I
 
03:08:43.730 --> 03:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
don't understand why we have two
 
03:08:45.950 --> 03:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
different systems
 
03:08:48.170 --> 03:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
so basically this would take care of
 
03:08:48.180 --> 03:08:49.090 align:start position:0%
so basically this would take care of
that

03:08:49.090 --> 03:08:49.100 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:51.410 --> 03:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
and essentially would
 
03:08:51.420 --> 03:08:54.050 align:start position:0%
and essentially would
um

03:08:54.050 --> 03:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:56.750 --> 03:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
would adopt those 1910 standards which
 
03:08:59.090 --> 03:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
are the general the General Industry
 
03:09:01.309 --> 03:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
standards there's actually three
 
03:09:03.170 --> 03:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
different sets of Standards we've we've
 
03:09:06.050 --> 03:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
decided that these were the best fit and
 
03:09:08.210 --> 03:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
the public sector workers would be
 
03:09:10.550 --> 03:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
covered by those standards
 
03:09:12.530 --> 03:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
understand though that it would still be
 
03:09:14.090 --> 03:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
governed by the New Hampshire Department
 
03:09:17.929 --> 03:09:17.939 align:start position:0%
of Labor so the same inspectors that go
 
03:09:20.269 --> 03:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
out now to check public sector
 
03:09:22.969 --> 03:09:22.979 align:start position:0%
workplaces would be out checking public
 
03:09:26.630 --> 03:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
sector workplaces and um looking for
 
03:09:30.769 --> 03:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
safety issues that they could rectify
 
03:09:30.779 --> 03:09:32.570 align:start position:0%
safety issues that they could rectify
um

03:09:32.570 --> 03:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
so basically the bill does several
 
03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:36.290 align:start position:0%
so basically the bill does several
things

03:09:36.290 --> 03:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:09:40.190 --> 03:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
um it adopts the 1910 standards
 
03:09:43.490 --> 03:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
it repeals seven specific standards that
 
03:09:47.090 --> 03:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
have been adopted into RSA 277.
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
um that way we won't have overlapping
 
03:09:51.769 --> 03:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
standards the old New Hampshire standard
 
03:09:55.250 --> 03:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
and then the the new OSHA standard so we
 
03:09:57.710 --> 03:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
took out the New Hampshire standards
 
03:09:59.330 --> 03:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
which in some cases were very similar to
 
03:10:01.790 --> 03:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
the OSHA standards sometimes just a
 
03:10:06.469 --> 03:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
little bit shorter simpler but basically
 
03:10:08.630 --> 03:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
we would take those out and replace
 
03:10:11.809 --> 03:10:11.819 align:start position:0%
everything with the 1910 standards
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
um this bill would also direct and
 
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
authorize the New Hampshire Department
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
of Labor to make any rule changes that
 
03:10:20.630 --> 03:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
are needed to get those standards into
 
03:10:22.210 --> 03:10:22.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law
 
03:10:26.690 --> 03:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
so basically it uh it allows them to do
 
03:10:28.309 --> 03:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
what they do to make sure the safety
 
03:10:30.349 --> 03:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
standards are where they need to be in
 
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
in the rules
 
03:10:36.190 --> 03:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
there is one exception to what we um
 
03:10:39.849 --> 03:10:39.859 align:start position:0%
one piece of the 1910 rules that we
 
03:10:42.889 --> 03:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
carved out and did not adopt and that is
 
03:10:45.670 --> 03:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
section U which is shows up in the bill
 
03:10:48.830 --> 03:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
and what that is very simply are the
 
03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
covid safety standards
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
quite frankly
 
03:10:56.929 --> 03:10:56.939 align:start position:0%
we had no interest in getting into that
 
03:11:00.650 --> 03:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
um we we know what a third rail covet
 
03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
issues can be and this is about worker
 
03:11:05.150 --> 03:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
safety and we did not want to have the
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
whole thing sidelined by
 
03:11:09.650 --> 03:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
issues that are sometimes come up
 
03:11:13.370 --> 03:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
relating to covet so that's the only
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:19.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:11:19.730 --> 03:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:21.710 --> 03:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that this was
 
03:11:23.809 --> 03:11:23.819 align:start position:0%
necessary is that the New Hampshire
 
03:11:26.330 --> 03:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
standards were um
 
03:11:29.330 --> 03:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
in comparison to the OSHA standards were
 
03:11:31.490 --> 03:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
quite incomplete there are a lot of
 
03:11:34.670 --> 03:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
pieces that were just not in there in
 
03:11:38.450 --> 03:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
working with the Deputy Commissioner on
 
03:11:41.030 --> 03:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
this work we say well what for example
 
03:11:45.110 --> 03:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
there are no electrical standards in the
 
03:11:47.330 --> 03:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Department of Labor
 
03:11:47.340 --> 03:11:48.469 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire Department of Labor
standards

03:11:48.469 --> 03:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
standards
 
03:11:50.630 --> 03:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
and you know we asked well what would
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
happen if
 
03:11:53.630 --> 03:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
there's a junction box that was left
 
03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
open there's exposed wires and that type
 
03:11:59.570 --> 03:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
of thing and the the answer was that
 
03:12:03.410 --> 03:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
that would be covered by the um the uh
 
03:12:03.420 --> 03:12:06.110 align:start position:0%
that would be covered by the um the uh
General

03:12:06.110 --> 03:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:08.690 --> 03:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
I can't remember the term General
 
03:12:10.969 --> 03:12:10.979 align:start position:0%
conditions yeah
 
03:12:12.110 --> 03:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
was it
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
thank you there you go thank you general
 
03:12:18.530 --> 03:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
duty standards and essentially with the
 
03:12:21.050 --> 03:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
general duty standard is is basically
 
03:12:22.910 --> 03:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
says workplaces ought to be safe and you
 
03:12:24.710 --> 03:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
ought to make it that way
 
03:12:27.590 --> 03:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
um just in general things ought to be
 
03:12:29.630 --> 03:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
safe so that's a catch-all that anything
 
03:12:32.809 --> 03:12:32.819 align:start position:0%
that's unsafe you can um put it under
 
03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
um but we also concluded that that was
 
03:12:37.030 --> 03:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
unfair to both employers and employees
 
03:12:40.429 --> 03:12:40.439 align:start position:0%
if you don't put the standards into the
 
03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
laws or the rules then how is an
 
03:12:44.450 --> 03:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
employer supposed to know if they're in
 
03:12:46.309 --> 03:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
violation or not they're just going to
 
03:12:47.809 --> 03:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
have an inspector show up and said you
 
03:12:49.490 --> 03:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
should have known better
 
03:12:53.389 --> 03:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
um so this would fill in a lot of gaps
 
03:12:55.849 --> 03:12:55.859 align:start position:0%
that existed in the
 
03:12:59.870 --> 03:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire standards and would
 
03:13:02.030 --> 03:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
go much further and cover all of the
 
03:13:04.790 --> 03:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
various issues that OSHA has adopted
 
03:13:06.530 --> 03:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
03:13:06.540 --> 03:13:07.190 align:start position:0%
over the years
um

03:13:07.190 --> 03:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:10.849 --> 03:13:10.859 align:start position:0%
in an email yesterday I did send out the
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
file that the Department of Labor put
 
03:13:15.650 --> 03:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
together for the committee which I have
 
03:13:20.170 --> 03:13:20.180 align:start position:0%
to say they did one heck of a big job
 
03:13:23.809 --> 03:13:23.819 align:start position:0%
if anybody opened that file if if you do
 
03:13:26.150 --> 03:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
open the file you've got to download it
 
03:13:28.670 --> 03:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
first and make it um
 
03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh able to to edit once you do that
 
03:13:33.769 --> 03:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
it'll collapse down and you've got just
 
03:13:36.050 --> 03:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
the table of contents and you can click
 
03:13:37.969 --> 03:13:37.979 align:start position:0%
on the little arrow next to each item
 
03:13:41.269 --> 03:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
and it expands out and it shows
 
03:13:41.279 --> 03:13:42.230 align:start position:0%
and it expands out and it shows
um

03:13:42.230 --> 03:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:44.870 --> 03:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
in blue all of the areas that New
 
03:13:48.349 --> 03:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a standard in red they
 
03:13:51.889 --> 03:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
indicated areas that were perhaps
 
03:13:51.899 --> 03:13:53.809 align:start position:0%
indicated areas that were perhaps
unneeded

03:13:53.809 --> 03:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
unneeded
 
03:13:57.290 --> 03:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
and basically you'll see a lot of pieces
 
03:13:58.630 --> 03:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
that aren't blue
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire hasn't covered this
 
03:14:05.570 --> 03:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
would fill all of that in so I think
 
03:14:05.580 --> 03:14:07.190 align:start position:0%
would fill all of that in so I think
it's

03:14:07.190 --> 03:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:14:10.429 --> 03:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
very helpful to do this but it does it
 
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
does not bring OSHA well OSHA's already
 
03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it's it's here covering
 
03:14:18.469 --> 03:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
um private sector workers but basically
 
03:14:21.230 --> 03:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
it does not bring OSHA into our public
 
03:14:23.809 --> 03:14:23.819 align:start position:0%
sector workplaces the same folks that
 
03:14:26.690 --> 03:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
inspect now will be inspecting once um
 
03:14:29.269 --> 03:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
these standards are in place
 
03:14:29.279 --> 03:14:30.889 align:start position:0%
these standards are in place
um

03:14:30.889 --> 03:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:33.469 --> 03:14:33.479 align:start position:0%
I would say that the state of Maine and
 
03:14:34.870 --> 03:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
the state of Massachusetts
 
03:14:38.210 --> 03:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
adopted the OSHA standard some years ago
 
03:14:41.450 --> 03:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
and then concluded years later that we
 
03:14:42.950 --> 03:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
think we'd be better off having a state
 
03:14:42.960 --> 03:14:44.389 align:start position:0%
think we'd be better off having a state
plan

03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:14:45.950 --> 03:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
um might that happen down the road here
 
03:14:45.960 --> 03:14:48.110 align:start position:0%
um might that happen down the road here
maybe

03:14:48.110 --> 03:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:14:50.210 --> 03:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't have to and
 
03:14:50.220 --> 03:14:52.190 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't have to and
essentially

03:14:52.190 --> 03:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
03:14:55.130 --> 03:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
um we will simply have a much more
 
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:04.370 --> 03:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
and with that I think I'll end my
 
03:15:06.050 --> 03:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
testimony and take any questions that
 
03:15:08.090 --> 03:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
might be out there thank you
 
03:15:09.769 --> 03:15:09.779 align:start position:0%
thank you representative just for the
 
03:15:13.190 --> 03:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
record for people the 1910 is just a
 
03:15:15.349 --> 03:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
number numerical number in the law it's
 
03:15:19.790 --> 03:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
not the 1910 year information that we're
 
03:15:21.469 --> 03:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
adopting here thank you because that's
 
03:15:22.429 --> 03:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
what I thought they were talking about
 
03:15:25.610 --> 03:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
at first so are there any questions for
 
03:15:28.730 --> 03:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:31.490 --> 03:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
soon on thank you very much I I do have
 
03:15:34.610 --> 03:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
a representative uh Perez but I need to
 
03:15:37.570 --> 03:15:37.580 align:start position:0%
um ask her to hold we want to have a
 
03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Ogden
 
03:15:40.800 --> 03:15:41.690 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Ogden
um

03:15:41.690 --> 03:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:44.870 --> 03:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
I know is he he has to uh vacate the
 
03:15:49.490 --> 03:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:51.889 --> 03:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
all right Mr Ogden nice to see you again
 
03:15:54.230 --> 03:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
nice to see you thank you Rudy Ogden um
 
03:15:56.330 --> 03:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor I representative
 
03:15:58.730 --> 03:15:58.740 align:start position:0%
Sullivan did a great job of uh putting
 
03:16:00.110 --> 03:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
the information out there a couple
 
03:16:01.610 --> 03:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
things that we wanted to make sure were
 
03:16:04.309 --> 03:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
touched upon because questions have come
 
03:16:08.090 --> 03:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
up clearly this is not in any way uh
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
replacing or supplanting what's
 
03:16:11.330 --> 03:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
presently happening with private
 
03:16:13.610 --> 03:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
employers so private employers would
 
03:16:15.710 --> 03:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
still be governed and covered by OSHA
 
03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
through the U.S Department of Labor I
 
03:16:18.889 --> 03:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
understand there were some questions
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
that came up relative to that the
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
Department's Authority relative to
 
03:16:24.410 --> 03:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
enforce safety standards for employees
 
03:16:28.670 --> 03:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
comes from two places an RSA 277 and if
 
03:16:32.269 --> 03:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
you look at RSA 277 in terms of uh 1B
 
03:16:34.070 --> 03:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's the definitional section which
 
03:16:35.269 --> 03:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
makes pretty clear that what we're
 
03:16:37.070 --> 03:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
talking about is the state or its
 
03:16:39.110 --> 03:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
political subdivision so just to clarify
 
03:16:41.150 --> 03:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
this is not in any way interrupting
 
03:16:42.650 --> 03:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
interfering or supplanting what's
 
03:16:44.269 --> 03:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
happening relative to the U.S Department
 
03:16:46.490 --> 03:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
of Labor and its enforcement of Osha
 
03:16:49.190 --> 03:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
standards on private employers the other
 
03:16:50.690 --> 03:16:50.700 align:start position:0%
thing that I wanted to touch upon and
 
03:16:52.370 --> 03:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan did a great job
 
03:16:54.230 --> 03:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
of introducing it is folks have come up
 
03:16:56.269 --> 03:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
and said so presently what is happening
 
03:16:58.429 --> 03:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
the general duty Clause is a very real
 
03:17:00.290 --> 03:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
thing and what I mean by that is if we
 
03:17:03.050 --> 03:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
do come across safety concerns it's not
 
03:17:04.490 --> 03:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
as if we just say there's not an
 
03:17:06.590 --> 03:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
existing standard so it is entirely
 
03:17:08.990 --> 03:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
ignored instead what we would look at is
 
03:17:12.110 --> 03:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
lab 1403 it's a labor regulation which
 
03:17:13.610 --> 03:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
basically is resultant from our
 
03:17:16.070 --> 03:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement Authority Under RSA 277
 
03:17:18.349 --> 03:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
which allows the department to say
 
03:17:21.290 --> 03:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
employers and the public sector should
 
03:17:23.690 --> 03:17:23.700 align:start position:0%
be providing safe employment and there
 
03:17:25.429 --> 03:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
should be safeguards in place in order
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
to ensure that their workplaces are safe
 
03:17:30.530 --> 03:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
through that we have a general duty
 
03:17:31.910 --> 03:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
Clause where we're able to say to
 
03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
employers that is not safe that does not
 
03:17:38.090 --> 03:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
seem safe and subject to standard I will
 
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the general duties
 
03:17:42.050 --> 03:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
Clause is not the most beneficial
 
03:17:44.030 --> 03:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism in the sense of
 
03:17:46.670 --> 03:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
you have to for every time you cite and
 
03:17:48.830 --> 03:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
use the general duty Clause you are then
 
03:17:50.450 --> 03:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
coming from a position where you have to
 
03:17:53.210 --> 03:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
establish that what you're providing is
 
03:17:55.969 --> 03:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
a standard and it is accepted so that is
 
03:17:57.769 --> 03:17:57.779 align:start position:0%
something where oftentimes I will say
 
03:17:59.929 --> 03:17:59.939 align:start position:0%
our inspectors already look to OSHA
 
03:18:01.730 --> 03:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
standards or they look to generally
 
03:18:04.130 --> 03:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
industry accepted standards and from
 
03:18:06.050 --> 03:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
that they try and extrapolate what a
 
03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh general duty Clause
 
03:18:11.210 --> 03:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
standard would be I would acknowledge
 
03:18:13.370 --> 03:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
the department has to do a better job on
 
03:18:14.929 --> 03:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
safety this is something that was
 
03:18:16.849 --> 03:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
highlighted some years ago where people
 
03:18:18.530 --> 03:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
talked about the thoroughness of our
 
03:18:21.650 --> 03:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
inspections the work in terms of what
 
03:18:23.929 --> 03:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
went into reports I'm happy to report
 
03:18:25.790 --> 03:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
that I think we are doing a better job
 
03:18:28.490 --> 03:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
but we need to continue to do a better
 
03:18:31.610 --> 03:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
job and that whether this passes or not
 
03:18:34.670 --> 03:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
is something we will work towards and we
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
are working towards that relative to
 
03:18:39.050 --> 03:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
training and also recruitment when we
 
03:18:40.969 --> 03:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
worked with the study committee over the
 
03:18:43.490 --> 03:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
summer there were questions about how
 
03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
this would impact the department
 
03:18:46.790 --> 03:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
operations in terms of hiring or
 
03:18:49.190 --> 03:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
additional staff needed when this was
 
03:18:51.110 --> 03:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
looked at or presented as coming in
 
03:18:53.150 --> 03:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
being a full OSHA state plan we had
 
03:18:54.710 --> 03:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
talked of having upwards of an
 
03:18:57.290 --> 03:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
additional six positions I want to be
 
03:18:58.969 --> 03:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
clear that we were talking about hiring
 
03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
an additional six staff four of those
 
03:19:03.710 --> 03:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
individuals were specifically going to
 
03:19:05.570 --> 03:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
be working with the consultancy program
 
03:19:07.610 --> 03:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
not to get too far in the weeds but if
 
03:19:09.170 --> 03:19:09.180 align:start position:0%
you're an OSHA state plan you actually
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
have to set up and establish a
 
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
consultancy program for the benefit of
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
employers we envisioned if we set up
 
03:19:17.630 --> 03:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
that consultancy program we would hire
 
03:19:19.610 --> 03:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
three additional inspectors who would
 
03:19:21.469 --> 03:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
not do field inspections but would just
 
03:19:23.330 --> 03:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
be working on a consultancy basis
 
03:19:25.550 --> 03:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
additionally we envisioned putting in
 
03:19:27.650 --> 03:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
place administrative support for that
 
03:19:29.929 --> 03:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
consult potency program consultancy
 
03:19:32.330 --> 03:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
programs are a good thing consultancy
 
03:19:33.650 --> 03:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
programs are something we might think
 
03:19:35.389 --> 03:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
about again no matter what happens here
 
03:19:37.309 --> 03:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
but because this is no longer saying
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
you're going to be an OSHA state plan
 
03:19:41.030 --> 03:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
and you need that we do not anticipate
 
03:19:43.969 --> 03:19:43.979 align:start position:0%
pursuing those positions presently the
 
03:19:45.230 --> 03:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
other if we're talking about six
 
03:19:47.330 --> 03:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
positions total the other positions we
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
were talking about was an additional
 
03:19:50.990 --> 03:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
field inspector historically at least in
 
03:19:52.309 --> 03:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
my time or tenure with the Department
 
03:19:54.830 --> 03:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
we've always had two field inspectors
 
03:19:56.929 --> 03:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
wholly dedicated to performing safety
 
03:19:56.939 --> 03:19:58.250 align:start position:0%
wholly dedicated to performing safety
inspections

03:19:58.250 --> 03:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
03:20:01.130 --> 03:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
we anticipated hiring a third we have
 
03:20:03.170 --> 03:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
done that in the sense of we have put a
 
03:20:05.090 --> 03:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
position in place we are recruiting for
 
03:20:06.710 --> 03:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
that we presently have two safety
 
03:20:08.929 --> 03:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
inspectors we are trying to hire a third
 
03:20:11.150 --> 03:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
I understand some folks might say well
 
03:20:13.490 --> 03:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
that's only one additional uh inspector
 
03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
but I would say when you only had two
 
03:20:17.809 --> 03:20:17.819 align:start position:0%
adding a third is a significant
 
03:20:19.370 --> 03:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
enhancement of the services we're
 
03:20:19.380 --> 03:20:20.690 align:start position:0%
enhancement of the services we're
offering

03:20:20.690 --> 03:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
offering
 
03:20:22.610 --> 03:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
um so we hope that that that works
 
03:20:24.290 --> 03:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
towards a gun regardless of what happens
 
03:20:26.690 --> 03:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
with this bill other things that have
 
03:20:27.950 --> 03:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
come up as questions of the department
 
03:20:29.809 --> 03:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
is people have said well you know is
 
03:20:31.490 --> 03:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
this going to be hard for the cities and
 
03:20:33.410 --> 03:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
towns I do think that there are
 
03:20:35.269 --> 03:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
instances in which cities and towns will
 
03:20:38.269 --> 03:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
have difficulties I do think that when
 
03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
these standards are are set out there
 
03:20:42.290 --> 03:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
and made clear
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
um again as representative Sullivan
 
03:20:46.969 --> 03:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
referenced uh there's a lot there and I
 
03:20:48.650 --> 03:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
imagine that there are some cities and
 
03:20:51.530 --> 03:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
towns that are not up to standard and in
 
03:20:53.389 --> 03:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
those instances there would be work that
 
03:20:55.010 --> 03:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
would have to be done there would be
 
03:20:57.230 --> 03:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
costs folks have asked can we quantify
 
03:20:59.030 --> 03:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
that cost the department unfortunately
 
03:21:01.309 --> 03:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
we're not in a position to say what this
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
would cost each individual City and town
 
03:21:05.510 --> 03:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the state additionally there'd be
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
added costs and effort that the state
 
03:21:09.889 --> 03:21:09.899 align:start position:0%
itself would have to put forward each
 
03:21:12.650 --> 03:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
state agency as a public employer would
 
03:21:14.269 --> 03:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that they were up to
 
03:21:15.950 --> 03:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
standard I will say in having talked
 
03:21:17.750 --> 03:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
with some agencies some agencies feel
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
that they are there but again it would
 
03:21:22.309 --> 03:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
have to be something that would then be
 
03:21:23.690 --> 03:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
03:21:25.490 --> 03:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
we've had the question come up would
 
03:21:27.530 --> 03:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
there be some type of grace period or
 
03:21:29.510 --> 03:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
some type of you know easing into this
 
03:21:32.269 --> 03:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass these would be the
 
03:21:33.769 --> 03:21:33.779 align:start position:0%
standards these are the standards that
 
03:21:36.170 --> 03:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
we would hold employers to I would say
 
03:21:37.849 --> 03:21:37.859 align:start position:0%
that I don't imagine us departing from
 
03:21:39.710 --> 03:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
our existing practice and our existing
 
03:21:41.950 --> 03:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
practices when we do a safety inspection
 
03:21:44.570 --> 03:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
absent some type of immediate need for
 
03:21:46.670 --> 03:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
injunctive relief or immediate okay this
 
03:21:48.230 --> 03:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
is a life or death and something needs
 
03:21:50.330 --> 03:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
to stop in the immediate we presently
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
provide employers with a remediation
 
03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
period we understand that cities and
 
03:21:57.530 --> 03:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
towns and public employers they have to
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
work within a budget process and that's
 
03:22:01.370 --> 03:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
not to say that safety you know that
 
03:22:03.290 --> 03:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
cost shouldn't be safety that's pursued
 
03:22:05.090 --> 03:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
it is to say though that we understand
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
those practical realities and that's why
 
03:22:09.170 --> 03:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
again our inspections are typically
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
followed with a remediation period where
 
03:22:13.250 --> 03:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
what we're saying to the employer is
 
03:22:15.410 --> 03:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
listen we have identified certain things
 
03:22:17.210 --> 03:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
that are not to standard what is your
 
03:22:19.849 --> 03:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
plan to come to standard and and it has
 
03:22:21.469 --> 03:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
to be reasonable and that's not to say
 
03:22:23.330 --> 03:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
that we let someone say okay we'll do it
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
in four years that is to say that we are
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
looking for them to come up with a
 
03:22:29.030 --> 03:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable plan but I want to be playing
 
03:22:30.830 --> 03:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
that there would not be some overarching
 
03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
at least as presently put in place when
 
03:22:34.670 --> 03:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
this became effective those would be the
 
03:22:35.929 --> 03:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
effective standards that would be
 
03:22:35.939 --> 03:22:37.730 align:start position:0%
effective standards that would be
enforceable

03:22:37.730 --> 03:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
enforceable
 
03:22:39.530 --> 03:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer any other
 
03:22:41.389 --> 03:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
questions again this is something that
 
03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
we acknowledge it is an increase in the
 
03:22:46.130 --> 03:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
safety standards the policy of the the
 
03:22:48.290 --> 03:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
department is that we do and when I say
 
03:22:49.490 --> 03:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
the policy of the department the policy
 
03:22:50.690 --> 03:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
of the department in speaking on
 
03:22:52.429 --> 03:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
legislative matters is that we do not
 
03:22:54.170 --> 03:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
drive or attempt to drive or dictate
 
03:22:55.849 --> 03:22:55.859 align:start position:0%
policy we entirely defer to the
 
03:22:58.429 --> 03:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
legislature to come up with what they uh
 
03:23:00.530 --> 03:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
want to do and we we will enforce that
 
03:23:02.570 --> 03:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass it would be added
 
03:23:04.670 --> 03:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
effort on our parts again we've already
 
03:23:06.650 --> 03:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
taken some steps in whether this passes
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
or not you know we will continue to
 
03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
pursue improvements in this vein so
 
03:23:12.710 --> 03:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're happy to take any questions that
 
03:23:14.450 --> 03:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
folks may have
 
03:23:16.130 --> 03:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony do you have
 
03:23:17.690 --> 03:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
any questions for
 
03:23:20.030 --> 03:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative Goldman
 
03:23:21.650 --> 03:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
03:23:21.660 --> 03:23:22.670 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
question

03:23:22.670 --> 03:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:23:25.250 --> 03:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification for me in
 
03:23:26.690 --> 03:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
understanding this
 
03:23:29.870 --> 03:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
currently in a private business I'm
 
03:23:32.750 --> 03:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
going to use HVAC as an example we go up
 
03:23:35.150 --> 03:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
on a roof to work on the HVAC equipment
 
03:23:37.130 --> 03:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
we have to have some sort of fall
 
03:23:39.950 --> 03:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
protection or guardrail side rail at the
 
03:23:41.929 --> 03:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
private industry according to the OSHA
 
03:23:44.150 --> 03:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
standards so are you saying that
 
03:23:46.790 --> 03:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
currently if a public entity so if a
 
03:23:48.110 --> 03:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
town was doing their own service
 
03:23:50.030 --> 03:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance on their HVAC on their
 
03:23:52.190 --> 03:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
buildings that they don't have to follow
 
03:23:53.929 --> 03:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
that same guideline they don't have to
 
03:23:56.210 --> 03:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
put on fall protection or put up a side
 
03:23:58.250 --> 03:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
rail or any sort of protection to keep
 
03:24:00.050 --> 03:24:00.060 align:start position:0%
them from falling from the roof they
 
03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
certainly would not have to follow OSHA
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
standards I would say there are existing
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire standards as
 
03:24:07.370 --> 03:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan indicated if you
 
03:24:10.630 --> 03:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
look at RSA 277 there are very limited
 
03:24:13.190 --> 03:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
explicitly stated standards additionally
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
lab 1400 that's our administrative
 
03:24:19.309 --> 03:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
regulations resultant from RSA 277 the
 
03:24:22.130 --> 03:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
1400 rules as we call them do have
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
certain standards in place they do have
 
03:24:25.729 --> 03:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
standards in place relative to guard
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
rails they do have standards in place
 
03:24:29.870 --> 03:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
relative to scaffolding and tying off
 
03:24:31.729 --> 03:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature I would
 
03:24:33.530 --> 03:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
acknowledge they are not as exhaustive
 
03:24:36.170 --> 03:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
or expansive as what OSHA has and to be
 
03:24:38.210 --> 03:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
clear no the city or town would not have
 
03:24:40.309 --> 03:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
to specifically follow OSHA they would
 
03:24:42.889 --> 03:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
be following what we have with the
 
03:24:44.990 --> 03:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
caveat that if they have nothing on that
 
03:24:47.570 --> 03:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
we would perhaps look and say okay what
 
03:24:49.729 --> 03:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
is the general duty of what's you know
 
03:24:51.170 --> 03:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
are they meeting their general duty of
 
03:24:53.150 --> 03:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
safe standards at which point we might
 
03:24:55.309 --> 03:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
look to what OSHA offers but yes they
 
03:24:57.050 --> 03:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
would not have to presently follow OSHA
 
03:25:03.290 --> 03:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:07.130 --> 03:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
any additional questions the presenter
 
03:25:11.929 --> 03:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:13.309 --> 03:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
why don't you call state representative
 
03:25:17.690 --> 03:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:20.210 --> 03:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
welcome to the labor committee
 
03:25:22.370 --> 03:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
03:25:24.769 --> 03:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:25:26.510 --> 03:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
my name is estate representative Maria
 
03:25:28.490 --> 03:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
Perez I'm a state representative from
 
03:25:31.610 --> 03:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
District 43 Milford New Hampshire
 
03:25:35.210 --> 03:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of HB 232.
 
03:25:38.030 --> 03:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
I'm absurfai OSHA
 
03:25:40.910 --> 03:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
I took the training in berries
 
03:25:44.330 --> 03:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
Industries I even took the certification
 
03:25:47.210 --> 03:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
with my husband who's an electrician
 
03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
this is critical for us to pass it
 
03:25:53.690 --> 03:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
why because this is going to save cities
 
03:25:54.950 --> 03:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
and towns
 
03:25:57.410 --> 03:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
for accidents to happen with public
 
03:25:57.420 --> 03:25:59.410 align:start position:0%
for accidents to happen with public
workers

03:25:59.410 --> 03:25:59.420 align:start position:0%
workers
 
03:26:02.809 --> 03:26:02.819 align:start position:0%
like someone said before previously a
 
03:26:05.929 --> 03:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
lot of the public workers did not cover
 
03:26:08.570 --> 03:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
under the ocean certification the same
 
03:26:11.090 --> 03:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
way as a private sector it is critical
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
for us to think about this is a way to
 
03:26:18.050 --> 03:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
save towns citizen towns money when
 
03:26:20.530 --> 03:26:20.540 align:start position:0%
someone have an accident
 
03:26:23.090 --> 03:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
accidents can happen like someone say
 
03:26:24.830 --> 03:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
you know an electrician can get
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
electrocuted because someone forgot to
 
03:26:27.120 --> 03:26:28.670 align:start position:0%
electrocuted because someone forgot to
finish

03:26:28.670 --> 03:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
finish
 
03:26:31.429 --> 03:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
um the work or someone left some wires
 
03:26:33.410 --> 03:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
on the you know
 
03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
um not covered with uh electrical tables
 
03:26:38.929 --> 03:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
some type of incident like that so I
 
03:26:40.670 --> 03:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
think it is critical for us to think
 
03:26:44.330 --> 03:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
about this bill it's a way to protect
 
03:26:46.309 --> 03:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
the public workers and it's a way to
 
03:26:46.319 --> 03:26:47.210 align:start position:0%
the public workers and it's a way to
help

03:26:47.210 --> 03:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:26:49.550 --> 03:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
our communities to save money in the
 
03:26:51.469 --> 03:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
long term thank you so much for the
 
03:26:53.929 --> 03:26:53.939 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak up on this bill
 
03:26:56.030 --> 03:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have any questions for
 
03:26:59.630 --> 03:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:02.690 --> 03:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
seeing on thank you very much
 
03:27:05.450 --> 03:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Joyce Pittman from Das
 
03:27:08.570 --> 03:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:11.030 --> 03:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
the witness stand raise your right hand
 
03:27:18.889 --> 03:27:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:22.510 --> 03:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't know what Das is
 
03:27:25.070 --> 03:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
Das is the Department of administrative
 
03:27:25.080 --> 03:27:26.389 align:start position:0%
Das is the Department of administrative
services

03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:27:30.349 --> 03:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
also known as the state as an employer
 
03:27:32.570 --> 03:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
a public employer
 
03:27:34.790 --> 03:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
so my name is Joyce Pittman and I am the
 
03:27:36.530 --> 03:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
director of risk and benefits over at
 
03:27:39.490 --> 03:27:39.500 align:start position:0%
Das and I'm here to provide information
 
03:27:42.650 --> 03:27:42.660 align:start position:0%
about what this bill means from the
 
03:27:46.630 --> 03:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
perspective of a public employer
 
03:27:48.950 --> 03:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
I think that assistant commissioner
 
03:27:52.010 --> 03:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
Ogden made some very valid points as to
 
03:27:54.170 --> 03:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
for what it means for us as an employer
 
03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
to come into compliance with these
 
03:27:55.800 --> 03:27:57.650 align:start position:0%
to come into compliance with these
standards

03:27:57.650 --> 03:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
standards
 
03:27:57.660 --> 03:27:58.250 align:start position:0%
standards
um

03:27:58.250 --> 03:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:01.389 --> 03:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
back in 2020 there was House Bill
 
03:28:04.990 --> 03:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
1171 that also referenced a similar
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
requirement to comply with OSHA I think
 
03:28:10.729 --> 03:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
it was more making us an OSHA State this
 
03:28:13.849 --> 03:28:13.859 align:start position:0%
one is really having DOL be the
 
03:28:15.650 --> 03:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
um I'll say the the overarching
 
03:28:17.870 --> 03:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
standards provider but
 
03:28:19.729 --> 03:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
um an inspector
 
03:28:21.650 --> 03:28:21.660 align:start position:0%
what just to give you a background some
 
03:28:25.130 --> 03:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
background on Das we have one employee
 
03:28:27.950 --> 03:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
who is our loss control consultant and
 
03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
he assists All State agencies with their
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
efforts to comply with the general duty
 
03:28:36.729 --> 03:28:36.739 align:start position:0%
standards as well as all of those lab
 
03:28:40.849 --> 03:28:40.859 align:start position:0%
1400 and RSA 277 rules that are out
 
03:28:43.190 --> 03:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
there currently today
 
03:28:45.410 --> 03:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
um each agency depending upon what their
 
03:28:49.250 --> 03:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
business is their safety Staffing varies
 
03:28:51.110 --> 03:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
um I think it's safe to say that a
 
03:28:53.450 --> 03:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
general office environment doesn't have
 
03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
the same safety
 
03:28:59.030 --> 03:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
um Personnel involved as say the
 
03:29:01.250 --> 03:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation I'm just by
 
03:29:03.769 --> 03:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
the nature of their work but they are
 
03:29:05.870 --> 03:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
required to comply with those safety
 
03:29:09.229 --> 03:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
standards we assist them we also assist
 
03:29:11.450 --> 03:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
them with their jlmc which is a joint
 
03:29:13.010 --> 03:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
Loss Management committee and the
 
03:29:14.570 --> 03:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
formulation of those to make sure that
 
03:29:16.729 --> 03:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
they're reviewing any type of incident
 
03:29:19.070 --> 03:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
that happens and how we can prevent
 
03:29:21.170 --> 03:29:21.180 align:start position:0%
do preventative things to prevent the
 
03:29:22.849 --> 03:29:22.859 align:start position:0%
accident or the injury and then also
 
03:29:24.590 --> 03:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
from a workers comp standpoint if an
 
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
injury has happened what could we do to
 
03:29:28.490 --> 03:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
prevent that from happening again so
 
03:29:29.929 --> 03:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it from both sides with
 
03:29:33.349 --> 03:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
each of the agencies as individuals
 
03:29:33.359 --> 03:29:34.370 align:start position:0%
each of the agencies as individuals
um

03:29:34.370 --> 03:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:34.380 --> 03:29:36.590 align:start position:0%
um
the

03:29:36.590 --> 03:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:39.050 --> 03:29:39.060 align:start position:0%
comments that assistant commissioner
 
03:29:41.389 --> 03:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
Ogden said about the implementation of
 
03:29:43.490 --> 03:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
such a program our role would be to be
 
03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
reaching out with those different
 
03:29:47.510 --> 03:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
agencies to figure out where are they in
 
03:29:50.410 --> 03:29:50.420 align:start position:0%
the compliance efforts to meet these
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
1910 rules
 
03:29:56.269 --> 03:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
and what work needs to be done and the
 
03:29:58.070 --> 03:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
comparison will be different as he said
 
03:29:59.450 --> 03:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
with the different agencies some are
 
03:30:02.030 --> 03:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
closer than others how do we get them
 
03:30:04.969 --> 03:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
there so it's our role and and
 
03:30:06.830 --> 03:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner ogan also referenced
 
03:30:09.530 --> 03:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
consultancy programs those are
 
03:30:12.110 --> 03:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
consultancy programs to help an agency
 
03:30:14.210 --> 03:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
figure out you know you're close you're
 
03:30:16.250 --> 03:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
not there yet maybe this maybe that but
 
03:30:18.410 --> 03:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
we have to get them to that Baseline to
 
03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
make them into compliance with that and
 
03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
reach out to those agencies what we
 
03:30:23.870 --> 03:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
don't know is the time and money
 
03:30:26.090 --> 03:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
involved in doing that and I don't want
 
03:30:29.990 --> 03:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
to reiterate his testimony but I can't
 
03:30:32.030 --> 03:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
stress enough what that means to
 
03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
different agencies they may need to have
 
03:30:36.650 --> 03:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
staff hired they may need to have an
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
independent consultant come in and
 
03:30:39.650 --> 03:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
assist them just to get them to that
 
03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
Baseline so then we can actually take
 
03:30:42.530 --> 03:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
advantage of the New Hampshire
 
03:30:44.809 --> 03:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor consultancy program
 
03:30:47.690 --> 03:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of cost implications
 
03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration
 
03:30:51.590 --> 03:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
so I just want to throw that out there
 
03:30:53.630 --> 03:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
so that that's on the radar as well
 
03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
because this legislation when passed it
 
03:30:57.889 --> 03:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
becomes the standard where we have to
 
03:30:59.929 --> 03:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
get so it's a state mandate we have to
 
03:31:01.490 --> 03:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
be there and we
 
03:31:03.469 --> 03:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
haven't even really begun to do that
 
03:31:03.479 --> 03:31:05.510 align:start position:0%
haven't even really begun to do that
transition

03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
transition
 
03:31:10.190 --> 03:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:14.530 --> 03:31:14.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:17.210 --> 03:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
excuse me based on what you just said
 
03:31:17.220 --> 03:31:19.610 align:start position:0%
excuse me based on what you just said
the

03:31:19.610 --> 03:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:21.950 --> 03:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
you already have a group of people who
 
03:31:25.130 --> 03:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
are in place correct that are looking at
 
03:31:28.190 --> 03:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
the current environment for safety
 
03:31:30.590 --> 03:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
and they must be guided by something
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
so they end up making this up so there
 
03:31:34.370 --> 03:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
must be standards that they have been
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
Guided by already
 
03:31:40.190 --> 03:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
and so how is it that
 
03:31:40.200 --> 03:31:41.210 align:start position:0%
and so how is it that
um

03:31:41.210 --> 03:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:43.429 --> 03:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
how is it that this would be
 
03:31:46.849 --> 03:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
that much more of an issue if you
 
03:31:48.710 --> 03:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
already have a program in place you have
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
people in place they're responsible for
 
03:31:51.950 --> 03:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
the enforcement
 
03:31:54.050 --> 03:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
it's what assistant commissioner Ogden
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
was pointing out so we currently comply
 
03:32:02.030 --> 03:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
with the RSA 277 as well as the lab 1400
 
03:32:04.130 --> 03:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
rules those are the safety standards
 
03:32:05.929 --> 03:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
that are in place today when you do a
 
03:32:08.330 --> 03:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
side-by-side comparison and I I didn't
 
03:32:09.889 --> 03:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
actually get to see what you saw which
 
03:32:11.690 --> 03:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
was I heard blue highlights and the
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
variances between
 
03:32:15.229 --> 03:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
so it's I don't remember if you said
 
03:32:16.969 --> 03:32:16.979 align:start position:0%
it's the blue stuff is good which means
 
03:32:18.410 --> 03:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
we're already in compliance and the
 
03:32:20.929 --> 03:32:20.939 align:start position:0%
non-blue stuff is where we need to be as
 
03:32:22.849 --> 03:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
a state we haven't done that assessment
 
03:32:24.889 --> 03:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
with our individual agencies so there's
 
03:32:28.389 --> 03:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
the OSHA standards are more stringent
 
03:32:32.330 --> 03:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
more I'll say elaborate so
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
um that general duty standard
 
03:32:36.950 --> 03:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
what they're saying is is that some of
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
that you should just know but the OSHA
 
03:32:41.210 --> 03:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
standards actually spell them out you
 
03:32:43.729 --> 03:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
must do a b c d it's more black and
 
03:32:53.750 --> 03:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I was going to ask a
 
03:32:57.469 --> 03:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
question and it just dawned on me that
 
03:32:58.610 --> 03:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor and I probably
 
03:32:59.929 --> 03:32:59.939 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be sitting here in this chair
 
03:33:02.030 --> 03:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
right now so I'm going to sit back with
 
03:33:04.250 --> 03:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
everybody else and let the um
 
03:33:06.410 --> 03:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman take the rest of the
 
03:33:06.420 --> 03:33:10.309 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman take the rest of the
hearing

03:33:10.309 --> 03:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:11.929 --> 03:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
so next up
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to call Margaret Burns
 
03:33:16.969 --> 03:33:16.979 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:33:16.979 --> 03:33:20.750 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire Municipal
Association

03:33:20.750 --> 03:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.130 --> 03:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Margaret Burns
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the New
 
03:33:31.190 --> 03:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and we
 
03:33:33.410 --> 03:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
are here this afternoon in opposition to
 
03:33:36.530 --> 03:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
House Bill 232. public sector employees
 
03:33:38.450 --> 03:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire have not been subjected
 
03:33:40.929 --> 03:33:40.939 align:start position:0%
to OSHA standards since its Inception in
 
03:33:43.210 --> 03:33:43.220 align:start position:0%
1971. in
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
1994 public sector employees were
 
03:33:48.590 --> 03:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
required to comply with the rules you've
 
03:33:51.950 --> 03:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
heard about previously lab 1400 which
 
03:33:54.110 --> 03:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
are essentially boiled down simplified
 
03:33:57.410 --> 03:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
version of the OSHA standards House Bill
 
03:34:00.050 --> 03:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
232 would repeal some of the state
 
03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
statutes with respect to safety RSA
 
03:34:05.809 --> 03:34:05.819 align:start position:0%
chapter 277 and would require all public
 
03:34:08.769 --> 03:34:08.779 align:start position:0%
sector employees to comply with the 1910
 
03:34:11.929 --> 03:34:11.939 align:start position:0%
rules so this of course would include
 
03:34:13.790 --> 03:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
cities and towns as well as the state of
 
03:34:16.729 --> 03:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire our opposition is based on
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
the significant increase in costs that
 
03:34:21.050 --> 03:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
would be incurred to bring cities and
 
03:34:23.450 --> 03:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
towns up to compliance with these new
 
03:34:25.610 --> 03:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
rules and standards some of the
 
03:34:28.010 --> 03:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
testimony that you heard previously from
 
03:34:31.250 --> 03:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
Das about the need to do an assessment
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
potentially hire a consultant
 
03:34:35.510 --> 03:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
potentially bring on more staff or
 
03:34:37.969 --> 03:34:37.979 align:start position:0%
internally for cities and towns all of
 
03:34:39.769 --> 03:34:39.779 align:start position:0%
that would or for the State of New
 
03:34:41.630 --> 03:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all of that would apply to
 
03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well and while the
 
03:34:46.670 --> 03:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note does reference that there
 
03:34:49.130 --> 03:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
would be effects on local expenditures
 
03:34:51.410 --> 03:34:51.420 align:start position:0%
at the city Town level the county level
 
03:34:53.870 --> 03:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
as well as the state the fiscal note
 
03:34:56.570 --> 03:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
really focuses on the needs at the state
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
level to hire additional staff in order
 
03:35:01.610 --> 03:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
to implement these rules but there's
 
03:35:04.010 --> 03:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
really no detailed look at what the
 
03:35:06.530 --> 03:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
costs might be for cities and towns in
 
03:35:08.269 --> 03:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
order to get up to compliance and then
 
03:35:11.389 --> 03:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
comply with the 1910 rules
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
um I also wanted to note that in the
 
03:35:18.170 --> 03:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
committee's report which this bill is
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
based off of
 
03:35:22.370 --> 03:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
part of what the report States is that
 
03:35:24.590 --> 03:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
there was a mandate on the committee to
 
03:35:26.750 --> 03:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
speak with Municipal officials to
 
03:35:29.210 --> 03:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
understand the impact and I just wanted
 
03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
to know it's it's not clear to me which
 
03:35:34.429 --> 03:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities which Municipal officials
 
03:35:37.370 --> 03:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
gave input and gave information on what
 
03:35:38.690 --> 03:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
it would look like to come into
 
03:35:40.849 --> 03:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
compliance really to take a look at the
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
local level see where they're at and see
 
03:35:45.590 --> 03:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
what those needs would be there is some
 
03:35:47.210 --> 03:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
reference in the committee's report that
 
03:35:49.969 --> 03:35:49.979 align:start position:0%
OSHA provides up to 50 percent of State
 
03:35:51.710 --> 03:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
implementation but I believe because
 
03:35:54.410 --> 03:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill looking to create a
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
state plan this is instead a bill to
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
adopt the 1910 standards that funding
 
03:36:01.550 --> 03:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
would not come into play for New
 
03:36:03.290 --> 03:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in this circumstance but I
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
know I could be wrong about that the
 
03:36:08.929 --> 03:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
other point I wanted to make was regard
 
03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to timing of the bill the
 
03:36:14.269 --> 03:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
final committee report reference that
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
other states that have gone this route
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
have taken about three to five years to
 
03:36:21.229 --> 03:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
implement and the recommendation was
 
03:36:23.330 --> 03:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
that moving immediately on the creation
 
03:36:25.849 --> 03:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
and implementation of the OSHA state
 
03:36:28.490 --> 03:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
plan for public sector employees was a
 
03:36:30.530 --> 03:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
larger step than we were prepared to
 
03:36:32.389 --> 03:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
take at this point the commitment of
 
03:36:34.309 --> 03:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
several years of back and forth with
 
03:36:36.590 --> 03:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
region one seemed like too large a task
 
03:36:38.269 --> 03:36:38.279 align:start position:0%
to take on now
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned therefore that this bill
 
03:36:44.750 --> 03:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 232 would have no transition
 
03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
period as I take it sort of no grace
 
03:36:47.640 --> 03:36:48.769 align:start position:0%
period as I take it sort of no grace
period

03:36:48.769 --> 03:36:48.779 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
um before the implementation of the
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
rules come into effect and instead would
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
come into effect 60 days from passage
 
03:36:57.710 --> 03:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
really giving no time to appreciate both
 
03:36:59.929 --> 03:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
from the local budget perspective as
 
03:37:02.450 --> 03:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
well as from the Staffing and internal
 
03:37:04.969 --> 03:37:04.979 align:start position:0%
um you know compliance perspective what
 
03:37:06.830 --> 03:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
it takes to get us to where we need to
 
03:37:09.710 --> 03:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
be so for these reasons primarily based
 
03:37:11.929 --> 03:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
on cost and Staffing and these Implement
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
implications and HMA as opposed to House
 
03:37:18.050 --> 03:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
Bill 232 as written thank you very much
 
03:37:21.650 --> 03:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
um if we wanted to get more of a handle
 
03:37:25.250 --> 03:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
on what that cost would be at the
 
03:37:27.530 --> 03:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
municipal level
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
what could you tell us that might help
 
03:37:33.170 --> 03:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
us get there I think that certainly we
 
03:37:35.210 --> 03:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
know there would be significant costs
 
03:37:38.090 --> 03:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
but what could be helpful would be to
 
03:37:40.969 --> 03:37:40.979 align:start position:0%
look at different different types of
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
cities and towns as well as at the
 
03:37:45.170 --> 03:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
counties to appreciate where they're at
 
03:37:47.330 --> 03:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
what they have for internal staff right
 
03:37:49.670 --> 03:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
now that deal with safety and compliance
 
03:37:52.130 --> 03:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
and what they would project they would
 
03:37:54.410 --> 03:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
need in order to
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
come into compliance with this very new
 
03:37:58.849 --> 03:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
set of rules and I just don't have a
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
sense of whether that input has been
 
03:38:04.370 --> 03:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
sought out yet to help in understanding
 
03:38:07.010 --> 03:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
the implications of this bill all right
 
03:38:08.510 --> 03:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:08.520 --> 03:38:09.889 align:start position:0%
thank you
click

03:38:09.889 --> 03:38:09.899 align:start position:0%
click
 
03:38:12.950 --> 03:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay hi thank you for your testimony I
 
03:38:15.410 --> 03:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
understand you have it typed
 
03:38:17.090 --> 03:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
um as the clerk I'd like to request a
 
03:38:18.530 --> 03:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
copy of it for the commission I have my
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
notes typed I would be happy to send
 
03:38:24.170 --> 03:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
them to the committee in an email after
 
03:38:26.450 --> 03:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
the fact if that would be okay great and
 
03:38:28.550 --> 03:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
I did also have a question it's sort of
 
03:38:30.650 --> 03:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
the other side of the pancake for of
 
03:38:33.050 --> 03:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
your question do you does the municipal
 
03:38:36.050 --> 03:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
Association keep track of the increase
 
03:38:38.450 --> 03:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
needed for
 
03:38:40.670 --> 03:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
um workers compensation claims because
 
03:38:43.490 --> 03:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
of accidents and any additional costs
 
03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
because of deaths that's at the
 
03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
municipal level because I know that
 
03:38:49.010 --> 03:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
definitely has happened that's a great
 
03:38:51.170 --> 03:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
question and and frankly it was an
 
03:38:53.269 --> 03:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
excellent point about
 
03:38:55.969 --> 03:38:55.979 align:start position:0%
if we increase safety rules will we also
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
decrease future accidents and future
 
03:39:00.889 --> 03:39:00.899 align:start position:0%
costs down the line and that may be true
 
03:39:03.889 --> 03:39:03.899 align:start position:0%
down the line but right now I'm looking
 
03:39:06.229 --> 03:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
at the cost of getting cities and towns
 
03:39:07.870 --> 03:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
up to speed on where they need to be
 
03:39:10.250 --> 03:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't track that
 
03:39:12.830 --> 03:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
information and HMA does not provide
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
workers comp insurance or other types of
 
03:39:17.750 --> 03:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
insurance so we would not have that
 
03:39:21.889 --> 03:39:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:23.830 --> 03:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative Luca
 
03:39:28.729 --> 03:39:28.739 align:start position:0%
thank you excuse me
 
03:39:31.490 --> 03:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
so you you said you follow a set of
 
03:39:34.490 --> 03:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
rules that are like just convoluted
 
03:39:37.250 --> 03:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
to uh the basic OSHA rules
 
03:39:39.410 --> 03:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
how far a span is it I mean would it be
 
03:39:41.929 --> 03:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
that difficult to just fill in the gaps
 
03:39:45.229 --> 03:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
and get you up to that speed it seems to
 
03:39:46.370 --> 03:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
me if you're already following some
 
03:39:49.190 --> 03:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
safety rules that it shouldn't be
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know too far apart where you would
 
03:39:53.929 --> 03:39:53.939 align:start position:0%
have to spend a ton of money to to get
 
03:39:56.330 --> 03:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
caught up so that's correct the cities
 
03:39:58.910 --> 03:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
and towns currently follow lab 1400
 
03:39:58.920 --> 03:40:00.010 align:start position:0%
and towns currently follow lab 1400
which

03:40:00.010 --> 03:40:00.020 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
admittedly not being an expert in safety
 
03:40:04.729 --> 03:40:04.739 align:start position:0%
rules and I won't sit up and put up here
 
03:40:06.950 --> 03:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
and pretend to be I understand them to
 
03:40:10.190 --> 03:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
be really just a boiled down version of
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
the 1910 uh rules that we're talking
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
about and so while they are sort of
 
03:40:18.349 --> 03:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
generally follow those rules there there
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
are significant differences between them
 
03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the key differences
 
03:40:25.610 --> 03:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
is that the rules that we have right now
 
03:40:28.429 --> 03:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
first for the public sector they do
 
03:40:31.130 --> 03:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
provide some flexibility in recognition
 
03:40:34.010 --> 03:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
that the public sector is different than
 
03:40:36.229 --> 03:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
the private sector in its internal
 
03:40:39.530 --> 03:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
capacity and Staffing not in its need to
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
be safe and protect its employees but
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
internally with regard to Staffing and
 
03:40:46.969 --> 03:40:46.979 align:start position:0%
budgeting and money there is there is a
 
03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
vast difference between the private
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
sector and the public sector and I think
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
that's a piece of why the rules are a
 
03:40:56.809 --> 03:40:56.819 align:start position:0%
little more flexible
 
03:41:00.349 --> 03:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you so just going on for
 
03:41:02.809 --> 03:41:02.819 align:start position:0%
representative asked you earlier about
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
the savings I mean wouldn't ultimately
 
03:41:07.370 --> 03:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
probably be saving on your insurances
 
03:41:10.250 --> 03:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
and and things like that
 
03:41:13.610 --> 03:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
so would maybe date offset over to over
 
03:41:15.889 --> 03:41:15.899 align:start position:0%
time obviously I mean initially it might
 
03:41:19.010 --> 03:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
be some some cost but I imagine over
 
03:41:20.630 --> 03:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
time it's going to even level out or
 
03:41:23.330 --> 03:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
even save in in the long run it is
 
03:41:26.150 --> 03:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
possible I wish I could make that
 
03:41:28.010 --> 03:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
projection because it would be helpful
 
03:41:30.590 --> 03:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
in this conversation but I just I don't
 
03:41:33.170 --> 03:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
know that for certain I do think that
 
03:41:35.450 --> 03:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
certainly there there may be some
 
03:41:37.670 --> 03:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities who would see this as
 
03:41:39.769 --> 03:41:39.779 align:start position:0%
positive but I think those would
 
03:41:41.870 --> 03:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
potentially be the municipalities who
 
03:41:44.269 --> 03:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
sort of the maybe the outliers who have
 
03:41:46.969 --> 03:41:46.979 align:start position:0%
much more significant staff than some of
 
03:41:50.269 --> 03:41:50.279 align:start position:0%
our teeny uh towns around the state with
 
03:41:52.130 --> 03:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
very limited staff
 
03:41:53.809 --> 03:41:53.819 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:41:57.650 --> 03:41:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh if I'm characterizing this uh uh
 
03:42:03.650 --> 03:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
wrong let me know please uh
 
03:42:06.050 --> 03:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
there is there seems to be kind of a
 
03:42:10.010 --> 03:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
patchwork of uh of enforcement uh
 
03:42:12.889 --> 03:42:12.899 align:start position:0%
different applications of safety
 
03:42:14.990 --> 03:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
standards throughout the state different
 
03:42:18.650 --> 03:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
towns uh different maybe Investments of
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
resources into that that whole safety
 
03:42:23.090 --> 03:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
perspective that
 
03:42:25.969 --> 03:42:25.979 align:start position:0%
so sometimes you do you think there is
 
03:42:27.050 --> 03:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
some Merit
 
03:42:32.030 --> 03:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
in having a standard uh for all public
 
03:42:34.190 --> 03:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
sector workers in the state
 
03:42:37.010 --> 03:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
that we move towards as opposed to this
 
03:42:40.070 --> 03:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
kind of Patchwork of uh of enforcement
 
03:42:42.530 --> 03:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
of the current laws
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's a great question I guess the way
 
03:42:47.349 --> 03:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
that I see what we currently have lab
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
1400 we don't necessarily have a
 
03:42:53.450 --> 03:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
patchwork of different rules for
 
03:42:56.090 --> 03:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
different municipalities but from what
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
I've heard in testimony earlier this
 
03:43:01.550 --> 03:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
um good
 
03:43:03.110 --> 03:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna forget it even though it's
 
03:43:06.290 --> 03:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
been said uh General
 
03:43:09.530 --> 03:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
this general duty standard that sort of
 
03:43:13.070 --> 03:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
fills in that Gap potentially could
 
03:43:16.610 --> 03:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
create some differences among the
 
03:43:18.170 --> 03:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
scenarios in different cities and towns
 
03:43:19.429 --> 03:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
right it's it's a little bit more
 
03:43:21.469 --> 03:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
flexible of a rule rather than a
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
hard-line black and white rule so I I
 
03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
don't think we have a patchwork in the
 
03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
rules but I do agree with your comment
 
03:43:31.969 --> 03:43:31.979 align:start position:0%
that we have a difference among
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
different cities and towns about how
 
03:43:37.849 --> 03:43:37.859 align:start position:0%
much investment they may be making at
 
03:43:41.570 --> 03:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
this level simply because of competing
 
03:43:44.210 --> 03:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
budget demands as well as overall budget
 
03:43:47.090 --> 03:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
as well as property tax revenue and
 
03:43:49.250 --> 03:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
other revenue and all the things that go
 
03:43:52.490 --> 03:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
into creating what the municipality has
 
03:43:54.769 --> 03:43:54.779 align:start position:0%
for a budget in order to carry out
 
03:43:54.779 --> 03:43:56.510 align:start position:0%
for a budget in order to carry out
policy

03:43:56.510 --> 03:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:43:58.130 --> 03:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
one one quick follow-up question
 
03:43:58.140 --> 03:43:59.570 align:start position:0%
one one quick follow-up question
follow-up

03:43:59.570 --> 03:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:44:03.950 --> 03:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
the association
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
that public employees uh and I don't
 
03:44:11.690 --> 03:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
want to put words in your mouth
 
03:44:14.450 --> 03:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
but the idea of adopting a standard that
 
03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
would be Central that would be across
 
03:44:19.010 --> 03:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
the board and applied across the board
 
03:44:21.290 --> 03:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
to every city in town is it the position
 
03:44:23.809 --> 03:44:23.819 align:start position:0%
of the municipal Association that that
 
03:44:26.570 --> 03:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
standardized kind of uh application of
 
03:44:31.729 --> 03:44:31.739 align:start position:0%
rules uh and and regulations uh is not
 
03:44:33.889 --> 03:44:33.899 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of public sector
 
03:44:37.610 --> 03:44:37.620 align:start position:0%
workers not necessarily we do have a
 
03:44:40.490 --> 03:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
very specific policy for example on
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide zoning mandates because zoning
 
03:44:46.729 --> 03:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
and land use is a historically local
 
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
control regulated area so so we would
 
03:44:52.010 --> 03:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
for example in that area oppose
 
03:44:54.110 --> 03:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide standards that take away local
 
03:44:56.269 --> 03:44:56.279 align:start position:0%
Authority but what we're talking about
 
03:44:59.030 --> 03:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
here no we don't have sort of an
 
03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
across-the-board policy that any kind of
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
centralized Statewide standard is bad
 
03:45:07.550 --> 03:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
what this touches on however is the
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
state creating a new centralized state
 
03:45:13.370 --> 03:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
standard and not recognizing or not
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
appropriating any funds or support for
 
03:45:18.889 --> 03:45:18.899 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns to come up to that
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
new State's centralized standard and the
 
03:45:25.429 --> 03:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
other piece of this there that means is
 
03:45:28.729 --> 03:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
I'm unclear where even the funds for the
 
03:45:30.349 --> 03:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
state to implement the program because
 
03:45:32.750 --> 03:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 232 I don't believe is an
 
03:45:35.150 --> 03:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation bill so that would be the
 
03:45:36.889 --> 03:45:36.899 align:start position:0%
other side of this will there be an
 
03:45:39.110 --> 03:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation made is it a separate bill
 
03:45:41.929 --> 03:45:41.939 align:start position:0%
is it in the state budget to carry out
 
03:45:45.650 --> 03:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
the implementation and and these changes
 
03:45:48.370 --> 03:45:48.380 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:45:51.309 --> 03:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:45:53.570 --> 03:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
responsibility of you I think if you if
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
you approach us and you suggest that
 
03:45:57.429 --> 03:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a cost
 
03:46:00.530 --> 03:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
I would like to see you quantify that
 
03:46:02.630 --> 03:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
and provide some evidence to the
 
03:46:02.640 --> 03:46:03.889 align:start position:0%
and provide some evidence to the
committee

03:46:03.889 --> 03:46:03.899 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:46:05.750 --> 03:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
that in those in the cases of the
 
03:46:07.309 --> 03:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
application of a standard that there
 
03:46:09.110 --> 03:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
would be that you could identify
 
03:46:10.490 --> 03:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
03:46:10.500 --> 03:46:12.769 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
specifically

03:46:12.769 --> 03:46:12.779 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:46:15.170 --> 03:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
um where this uh where what you're
 
03:46:18.590 --> 03:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
saying is is accurate thank you
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
03:46:22.729 --> 03:46:22.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:46:24.830 --> 03:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question I understand your
 
03:46:27.469 --> 03:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
concern about the uncertainty uh with
 
03:46:29.090 --> 03:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
the money that may or may not be
 
03:46:31.370 --> 03:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
involved uh you know you don't know
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
until you start doing it and it could be
 
03:46:35.510 --> 03:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
a lot less or it could be a lot more and
 
03:46:37.790 --> 03:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps then it would be some uh
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
appetite for an appropriation to handle
 
03:46:42.530 --> 03:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
to address this but I'm concerned that
 
03:46:45.530 --> 03:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
with what you have now is the lab 14 and
 
03:46:48.530 --> 03:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
various interpretations of that we're
 
03:46:50.450 --> 03:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
here I think because of an incident that
 
03:46:53.090 --> 03:46:53.100 align:start position:0%
happened a few years ago and a young
 
03:46:55.010 --> 03:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
woman came to us and told us about the
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
loss of her father and I don't know if
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
those lab rules uh were there to protect
 
03:47:02.269 --> 03:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
him or they they perhaps they were
 
03:47:05.929 --> 03:47:05.939 align:start position:0%
insufficient or misinterpreted
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
is that is this something we should be
 
03:47:11.450 --> 03:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
pursuing and hopefully let the let the
 
03:47:16.370 --> 03:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.490 --> 03:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
from my position as the Director of the
 
03:47:22.490 --> 03:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
association it is my responsibility to
 
03:47:26.510 --> 03:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
point out if a new state law will change
 
03:47:28.729 --> 03:47:28.739 align:start position:0%
standards that increase costs for cities
 
03:47:30.830 --> 03:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
and towns and to and to bring that to
 
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
the attention of legislators so that's
 
03:47:36.530 --> 03:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
what I'm that's what I'm doing and and
 
03:47:38.570 --> 03:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
I'm recognizing that on behalf of the
 
03:47:40.849 --> 03:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
cities and towns of New Hampshire I am
 
03:47:43.010 --> 03:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
aware of that situation and I am not
 
03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
here to suggest that safety is not
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
important for the public sector
 
03:47:49.670 --> 03:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:53.330 --> 03:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:55.130 --> 03:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
03:47:55.140 --> 03:47:56.870 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimony

03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:48:00.070 --> 03:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
next up I'd like to recognize Susie Nord
 
03:48:03.590 --> 03:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
representing National Cosh
 
03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:10.130 --> 03:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you to the
 
03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me this
 
03:48:13.790 --> 03:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is Susie
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
Nord and I work for the National Council
 
03:48:18.050 --> 03:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
on occupational safety and health
 
03:48:21.410 --> 03:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
and if the previous speaker was here to
 
03:48:23.929 --> 03:48:23.939 align:start position:0%
talk to you about this bill from the
 
03:48:26.870 --> 03:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
perspective of employers I'm here to
 
03:48:28.490 --> 03:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
tell you a little bit about this bill
 
03:48:30.610 --> 03:48:30.620 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of employees
 
03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
specifically one employee who
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
um representative Cahill mentioned his
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
name was Tom Wooten and he worked for
 
03:48:41.150 --> 03:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
the Northfield Department of Public
 
03:48:41.160 --> 03:48:42.769 align:start position:0%
the Northfield Department of Public
Works

03:48:42.769 --> 03:48:42.779 align:start position:0%
Works
 
03:48:44.690 --> 03:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
please bear with me because normally his
 
03:48:48.530 --> 03:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
daughter is the person who does the
 
03:48:50.870 --> 03:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
speaking on this bill
 
03:48:52.969 --> 03:48:52.979 align:start position:0%
um however she passed away last year
 
03:48:52.979 --> 03:48:54.769 align:start position:0%
um however she passed away last year
unexpectedly

03:48:54.769 --> 03:48:54.779 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly
 
03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
nervous and emotional
 
03:49:03.050 --> 03:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
and frankly a little bit angry because
 
03:49:03.060 --> 03:49:03.769 align:start position:0%
and frankly a little bit angry because
um

03:49:03.769 --> 03:49:03.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:07.309 --> 03:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
what this family has paid
 
03:49:07.319 --> 03:49:09.110 align:start position:0%
what this family has paid
is

03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:49:11.570 --> 03:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
being you know broken down into taxpayer
 
03:49:11.580 --> 03:49:13.729 align:start position:0%
being you know broken down into taxpayer
dollars

03:49:13.729 --> 03:49:13.739 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:49:15.530 --> 03:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
no there's no two no doubt about it
 
03:49:18.410 --> 03:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
because what happened was Tom Wooten was
 
03:49:19.809 --> 03:49:19.819 align:start position:0%
asked to do something
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
ridiculously unsafe because his employer
 
03:49:26.990 --> 03:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
didn't want to pay to do it safely
 
03:49:29.690 --> 03:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
so what happened
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
Northfield had a tractor-trailer the
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
back end of a tractor trailer that they
 
03:49:37.610 --> 03:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
moved twice a year rather than paying
 
03:49:41.570 --> 03:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
500 bucks 250 dollars to put that onto a
 
03:49:43.550 --> 03:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
truck and take it where it needed to go
 
03:49:45.650 --> 03:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
they used their Department of Public
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
Works employees and two front loaders
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
and They carried it between the front
 
03:49:50.760 --> 03:49:52.070 align:start position:0%
and They carried it between the front
loaders

03:49:52.070 --> 03:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
loaders
 
03:49:55.790 --> 03:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
with flaggers Tom Wooten was a flagger
 
03:49:58.910 --> 03:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
the trailer slipped Tom Wooten tried to
 
03:50:01.370 --> 03:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
study it and he was literally crushed
 
03:50:03.830 --> 03:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
between the trailer and the front loader
 
03:50:05.690 --> 03:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
and that's what happens to public
 
03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
employees when you allow these
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
ridiculous concerns about five hundred
 
03:50:13.849 --> 03:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
dollars being too much for the taxpayers
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
03:50:17.630 --> 03:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
I guarantee you that Tom wooten's family
 
03:50:19.790 --> 03:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
has paid well more than five hundred
 
03:50:19.800 --> 03:50:20.929 align:start position:0%
has paid well more than five hundred
dollars

03:50:20.929 --> 03:50:20.939 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I really get upset about this
 
03:50:26.809 --> 03:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
because I know this family I met them in
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
2017 when I worked for our local New
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire affiliate the New Hampshire
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
Coalition for occupational safety and
 
03:50:36.170 --> 03:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
health every year on workers Memorial
 
03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
Day I've seen some of you at the dinner
 
03:50:41.809 --> 03:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
we have a dinner to commemorate and
 
03:50:44.929 --> 03:50:44.939 align:start position:0%
recognize the sacrifices of not just
 
03:50:46.729 --> 03:50:46.739 align:start position:0%
public sector workers but all workers
 
03:50:48.769 --> 03:50:48.779 align:start position:0%
who are killed on the job
 
03:50:53.330 --> 03:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
and we know that most on the job I don't
 
03:50:54.530 --> 03:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
want to call them accidents because
 
03:50:57.050 --> 03:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
they're not they're preventable they are
 
03:51:00.110 --> 03:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
tragedies and largely preventable
 
03:51:01.849 --> 03:51:01.859 align:start position:0%
tragedies you know what the town in
 
03:51:04.490 --> 03:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
Northfield did as soon as Tom died they
 
03:51:06.590 --> 03:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
sent all of their employees to OSHA 10
 
03:51:06.600 --> 03:51:07.849 align:start position:0%
sent all of their employees to OSHA 10
training

03:51:07.849 --> 03:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be interesting if they had
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
had that training before where would the
 
03:51:14.630 --> 03:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:17.389 --> 03:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
I understand that there is cost
 
03:51:19.610 --> 03:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
Associated for the towns and I want you
 
03:51:22.250 --> 03:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
to remember there is cost Associated for
 
03:51:23.750 --> 03:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
the employees
 
03:51:25.250 --> 03:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
there is
 
03:51:28.010 --> 03:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
very little in-state statute that says
 
03:51:29.870 --> 03:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
that the employers have to provide
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
protect personal protective equipment
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
the way they do for the private sector
 
03:51:32.880 --> 03:51:34.190 align:start position:0%
the way they do for the private sector
employees

03:51:34.190 --> 03:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
is it there
 
03:51:37.729 --> 03:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
you guys have the the list the blue and
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
black and red list
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
safety goggles steel toed boots
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
um protective coverings if they're
 
03:51:47.690 --> 03:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
dealing with hazardous chemicals there's
 
03:51:50.570 --> 03:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
all kinds of protections that employee
 
03:51:53.330 --> 03:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
that workers need
 
03:51:55.790 --> 03:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
and employers may or may not provide
 
03:51:55.800 --> 03:51:57.530 align:start position:0%
and employers may or may not provide
them

03:51:57.530 --> 03:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:52:00.530 --> 03:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
Town can't afford that maybe next year
 
03:52:03.050 --> 03:52:03.060 align:start position:0%
so they're buying them for themselves
 
03:52:04.849 --> 03:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
you know I worked for a company I had no
 
03:52:07.550 --> 03:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
idea that the PPE was required I worked
 
03:52:09.950 --> 03:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
for a company in the 90s I was in human
 
03:52:11.630 --> 03:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
resources and one of my jobs was to
 
03:52:13.729 --> 03:52:13.739 align:start position:0%
reimburse people for their safety
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
classes and their boots and I thought
 
03:52:18.830 --> 03:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
wow that's really great that we do that
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
shows we care about our people
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
this would say that the state of New
 
03:52:26.690 --> 03:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cares about our people and
 
03:52:28.010 --> 03:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
this isn't just a couple people it's
 
03:52:30.110 --> 03:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
like 15 percent of the workforce in New
 
03:52:30.120 --> 03:52:30.769 align:start position:0%
like 15 percent of the workforce in New
Hampshire

03:52:30.769 --> 03:52:30.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:52:32.870 --> 03:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
that would be covered by this that means
 
03:52:34.729 --> 03:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
that's 15 of the workforce in New
 
03:52:36.650 --> 03:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who may not be covered right
 
03:52:38.809 --> 03:52:38.819 align:start position:0%
now now I know different towns and
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
cities do different things
 
03:52:42.889 --> 03:52:42.899 align:start position:0%
um Concord I've talked to people who
 
03:52:44.030 --> 03:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
work for Concord they're pretty good
 
03:52:45.769 --> 03:52:45.779 align:start position:0%
they have things
 
03:52:48.950 --> 03:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
um sometimes if the Public public sector
 
03:52:51.050 --> 03:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
workers are covered by a bargaining unit
 
03:52:52.849 --> 03:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
they put it right in their contract that
 
03:52:55.309 --> 03:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
they want certain protections so it's a
 
03:52:57.410 --> 03:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
patchwork and
 
03:52:59.150 --> 03:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
first of all the Department of Labor
 
03:53:01.070 --> 03:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
which does have jurisdiction to at least
 
03:53:03.290 --> 03:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
oversee it that was something that Sam
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
Wooten the daughter of Tom was able to
 
03:53:08.870 --> 03:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
um get the state to put into Statute in
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
2019 however
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Labor to actually
 
03:53:17.330 --> 03:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
know what standards these people are
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
having the different towns have and
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
what's in place and what they can do and
 
03:53:23.570 --> 03:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
really is the Department of Labor
 
03:53:25.969 --> 03:53:25.979 align:start position:0%
supposed to go can you afford to do the
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
right thing by your employees so then
 
03:53:29.389 --> 03:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
they don't cite them
 
03:53:31.969 --> 03:53:31.979 align:start position:0%
I mean there's at a certain point how
 
03:53:34.729 --> 03:53:34.739 align:start position:0%
much is a person's life worth
 
03:53:38.330 --> 03:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
this says that public sector employees
 
03:53:40.969 --> 03:53:40.979 align:start position:0%
should be equally protected to private
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
sector employees nothing more nothing
 
03:53:45.229 --> 03:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
less and if the towns aren't doing it
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
now then they're doing their employees a
 
03:53:48.530 --> 03:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
disservice they're doing your
 
03:53:52.190 --> 03:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
constituents a disservice and I heartily
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
heartily beg you to consider this us a
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
floor not a ceiling because within the
 
03:54:01.190 --> 03:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
health and safety workplace health and
 
03:54:04.130 --> 03:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
safety industry OSHA standards are
 
03:54:04.140 --> 03:54:05.510 align:start position:0%
safety industry OSHA standards are
floors

03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
floors
 
03:54:07.610 --> 03:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
they're not a ceiling this isn't a high
 
03:54:09.889 --> 03:54:09.899 align:start position:0%
standard for people this isn't saying go
 
03:54:12.590 --> 03:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
above and beyond what is needed this is
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
saying do the bare minimum that we know
 
03:54:19.370 --> 03:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
will keep people alive and healthy five
 
03:54:22.729 --> 03:54:22.739 align:start position:0%
thousand people a year die at work
 
03:54:25.790 --> 03:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
that's 10 a week more than one a day
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands are injured and
 
03:54:33.889 --> 03:54:33.899 align:start position:0%
I've heard of estimates as high as a
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand a year die from
 
03:54:38.809 --> 03:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
workplace illnesses like mesothelioma or
 
03:54:41.630 --> 03:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
black lung or things like that this is
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
and truthfully it's a hundred times
 
03:54:44.929 --> 03:54:44.939 align:start position:0%
better than it was before there were
 
03:54:46.670 --> 03:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
standards so if you think well it
 
03:54:47.809 --> 03:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter they're not going
 
03:54:50.510 --> 03:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
to help it does help having the
 
03:54:52.490 --> 03:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
standards helps it makes people think
 
03:54:54.769 --> 03:54:54.779 align:start position:0%
about safety it creates a culture of
 
03:54:58.030 --> 03:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
safety and all of this builds into into
 
03:55:01.010 --> 03:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
better workplaces better culture in the
 
03:55:03.250 --> 03:55:03.260 align:start position:0%
in the workplace lower turnover
 
03:55:05.929 --> 03:55:05.939 align:start position:0%
healthier people and these are your
 
03:55:07.189 --> 03:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
constituents these are our neighbors
 
03:55:08.630 --> 03:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
these are our friends sometimes they're
 
03:55:09.769 --> 03:55:09.779 align:start position:0%
our family
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
so I support this and I really really
 
03:55:14.929 --> 03:55:14.939 align:start position:0%
really hope that you will too
 
03:55:16.610 --> 03:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and I have written testimonies
 
03:55:18.110 --> 03:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:55:19.729 --> 03:55:19.739 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:55:19.739 --> 03:55:21.170 align:start position:0%
any questions
yes

03:55:21.170 --> 03:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:55:23.630 --> 03:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:55:26.090 --> 03:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
um do you have a sense or have any
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
statistics on what the cost differential
 
03:55:30.000 --> 03:55:31.429 align:start position:0%
statistics on what the cost differential
is

03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:55:35.630 --> 03:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
um for a municipality or any entity to
 
03:55:40.490 --> 03:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
pay preventive costs to train workers
 
03:55:40.500 --> 03:55:42.050 align:start position:0%
pay preventive costs to train workers
Etc

03:55:42.050 --> 03:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh versus those in like what the town of
 
03:55:48.050 --> 03:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
Northfield probably encountered after
 
03:55:51.110 --> 03:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
Tom wooten's passing you know the rising
 
03:55:55.250 --> 03:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
cost of um workers comp and death
 
03:55:58.130 --> 03:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
benefit payouts would you happen to have
 
03:55:59.990 --> 03:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
any statistics on that that would be
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
helpful I don't have any statistics on
 
03:56:05.570 --> 03:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
that I do know that when the committee
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
that brought this bill forward was
 
03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
considering the state plan
 
03:56:12.830 --> 03:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
um the whole consultancy program that is
 
03:56:15.170 --> 03:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
not in this bill would have been the
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
part of
 
03:56:19.130 --> 03:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
the um what was being considered that
 
03:56:21.950 --> 03:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
supports the cities in town it creates a
 
03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
consultant for them to use so
 
03:56:27.889 --> 03:56:27.899 align:start position:0%
um this doesn't have that so there is an
 
03:56:30.050 --> 03:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
Associated cost for example when
 
03:56:32.150 --> 03:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
Northfield sent everybody to OSHA 10
 
03:56:32.160 --> 03:56:33.590 align:start position:0%
Northfield sent everybody to OSHA 10
training

03:56:33.590 --> 03:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:56:36.290 --> 03:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
um there are places that do trainings I
 
03:56:37.490 --> 03:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire or New Hampshire
 
03:56:39.229 --> 03:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
affiliate has done trainings for public
 
03:56:41.450 --> 03:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
employers periodically I think they've
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
done some hazardous material training
 
03:56:46.910 --> 03:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
for town Safety people
 
03:56:50.570 --> 03:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
um but no there's a cost there is
 
03:56:50.580 --> 03:56:51.469 align:start position:0%
um but no there's a cost there is
um

03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
again I think the employees at least
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
probably are like yeah I'll take I'd pay
 
03:56:58.429 --> 03:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
it they're paying for their own
 
03:56:59.809 --> 03:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
protective equipment if they don't get
 
03:57:02.689 --> 03:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
it or you know
 
03:57:04.610 --> 03:57:04.620 align:start position:0%
they're risking they're they're putting
 
03:57:08.809 --> 03:57:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:11.210 --> 03:57:11.220 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
03:57:12.889 --> 03:57:12.899 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%

03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
Association of counties I don't spend a
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
lot of time in front of this committee
 
03:57:44.210 --> 03:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
so just to cover who we represent we
 
03:57:46.250 --> 03:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
represent all your elected and appointed
 
03:57:48.349 --> 03:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
officials all 10 counties are a member
 
03:57:51.469 --> 03:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
of our association uh the association
 
03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
has very strong concerns about this bill
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the costs that would be associated
 
03:57:59.389 --> 03:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
with it now that's not to say we are not
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about employee safety it is
 
03:58:03.050 --> 03:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
quite the opposite however you will
 
03:58:04.370 --> 03:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
notice in my letter that is coming
 
03:58:06.349 --> 03:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
around a quick list that the
 
03:58:08.269 --> 03:58:08.279 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County Nursing Home
 
03:58:10.130 --> 03:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
administrator pulled together of things
 
03:58:12.530 --> 03:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
that would need to be updated or changed
 
03:58:14.269 --> 03:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
or additional trainings that would need
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
to happen just in the nursing homes
 
03:58:19.130 --> 03:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
alone but would likely apply to all
 
03:58:21.590 --> 03:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
other departments in your county
 
03:58:24.170 --> 03:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
governments I will also remind you that
 
03:58:25.849 --> 03:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
you all sit as members of your
 
03:58:29.689 --> 03:58:29.699 align:start position:0%
delegation uh on County government you
 
03:58:31.969 --> 03:58:31.979 align:start position:0%
will see these costs I cannot put a
 
03:58:34.429 --> 03:58:34.439 align:start position:0%
specific specific number on that just
 
03:58:36.469 --> 03:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
because we don't collect that
 
03:58:36.479 --> 03:58:37.750 align:start position:0%
because we don't collect that
information

03:58:37.750 --> 03:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:58:40.670 --> 03:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
we could probably try and do an estimate
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
but each county is different I will say
 
03:58:45.229 --> 03:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
some departments are probably closer
 
03:58:47.689 --> 03:58:47.699 align:start position:0%
than others your nursing home is highly
 
03:58:51.410 --> 03:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
regulated by the county or by the
 
03:58:52.790 --> 03:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
federal government as well as your
 
03:58:55.610 --> 03:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
County correctional facilities if
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
nothing else the association would like
 
03:58:59.330 --> 03:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
to point out that the timeline on this
 
03:59:02.389 --> 03:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
bill is unattainable and we would
 
03:59:04.370 --> 03:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
recommend at least a three-year lead-in
 
03:59:06.950 --> 03:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
period if you were to pass this bill I
 
03:59:08.510 --> 03:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
will conclude my testimony at this point
 
03:59:10.130 --> 03:59:10.140 align:start position:0%
but if you have any questions I'm
 
03:59:11.809 --> 03:59:11.819 align:start position:0%
pleased to take them
 
03:59:14.630 --> 03:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
03:59:18.050 --> 03:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
yes the clerk thank you
 
03:59:19.849 --> 03:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
um I want to make sure I understood what
 
03:59:21.769 --> 03:59:21.779 align:start position:0%
you were saying do you have a sense of
 
03:59:25.010 --> 03:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
the costs that the counties need to pay
 
03:59:28.330 --> 03:59:28.340 align:start position:0%
for workplace accidents now or any
 
03:59:31.490 --> 03:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
higher Rises and benefit costs death
 
03:59:33.410 --> 03:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
benefits Etc thank you for the question
 
03:59:35.389 --> 03:59:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative we do not collect that
 
03:59:37.670 --> 03:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
information that would probably be a
 
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
more appropriate question for primex who
 
03:59:42.110 --> 03:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
is the insurer for all the counties but
 
03:59:45.950 --> 03:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:47.929 --> 03:59:47.939 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:59:50.929 --> 03:59:50.939 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you excuse
 
03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
me I'll ask you the same question I
 
03:59:55.010 --> 03:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
asked the municipal Association as it
 
03:59:56.750 --> 03:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
relates to
 
03:59:59.689 --> 03:59:59.699 align:start position:0%
um any evidence that you might have
 
04:00:03.290 --> 04:00:03.300 align:start position:0%
any comparison you've done uh Dev would
 
04:00:06.050 --> 04:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
show what the what this would cost local
 
04:00:08.210 --> 04:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
communities given that there are in
 
04:00:10.610 --> 04:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
programs currently in place or standards
 
04:00:13.610 --> 04:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
in place there's stuff going on so is
 
04:00:15.170 --> 04:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
this an argument that you're making are
 
04:00:17.330 --> 04:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
you presenting evidence to the committee
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
question I do not have any specific data
 
04:00:23.870 --> 04:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
I am happily to go back to the counties
 
04:00:25.610 --> 04:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
and ask them if they could put a dollar
 
04:00:27.950 --> 04:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
figure on it but I'm not sure that they
 
04:00:30.710 --> 04:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
would be able to not knowing how long
 
04:00:33.050 --> 04:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
you know it's going to take to update a
 
04:00:36.290 --> 04:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
particular uh program and procedure
 
04:00:38.809 --> 04:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
manual that's going to cost time and
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
labor for someone to do that it may take
 
04:00:42.950 --> 04:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:00:46.250 --> 04:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
10 minutes in one County it could take a
 
04:00:47.330 --> 04:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
different amount of time in another
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
County so I think it's going to vary
 
04:00:53.389 --> 04:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:56.750 --> 04:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative colcom
 
04:00:58.729 --> 04:00:58.739 align:start position:0%

this letter that I may have one more
copy

04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
copy

04:01:20.929 --> 04:01:20.939 align:start position:0%

yes

04:01:49.729 --> 04:01:49.739 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
04:01:53.689 --> 04:01:53.699 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Karen Leo Hill
 
04:01:57.050 --> 04:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
I'm a city councilor uh for 18 years in
 
04:01:58.670 --> 04:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon and the former mayor
 
04:02:00.769 --> 04:02:00.779 align:start position:0%
I also I didn't put it on the card I'm
 
04:02:03.170 --> 04:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
also a six-year
 
04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
County official serving as the treasurer
 
04:02:08.809 --> 04:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
of Grafton County I'm here in support of
 
04:02:09.910 --> 04:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:02:12.650 --> 04:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
and I will try to make my testimony
 
04:02:15.229 --> 04:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
brief in recognition of the time
 
04:02:17.710 --> 04:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
let's be very clear we're talking about
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
safety of workplace conditions
 
04:02:24.650 --> 04:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
and what we have heard is that public
 
04:02:28.370 --> 04:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
sector safety conditions are not the
 
04:02:31.610 --> 04:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
same as private sector conditions in
 
04:02:33.530 --> 04:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
fact all of the evidence all of the
 
04:02:35.150 --> 04:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
testimony because there hasn't actually
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
been evidence but all of the testimony
 
04:02:39.290 --> 04:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
offered so far by the department of
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
administrative Services by the municipal
 
04:02:43.610 --> 04:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
Association and by the County
 
04:02:48.170 --> 04:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
Association is in fact evidence of the
 
04:02:52.750 --> 04:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
deficiency of the current public sector
 
04:02:55.130 --> 04:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
workplace standards
 
04:02:58.010 --> 04:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
any evidence that they provide so far
 
04:03:00.790 --> 04:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
they have offered arguments about
 
04:03:04.070 --> 04:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
infinite costs which in fact suggests
 
04:03:06.410 --> 04:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
that the current workplace conditions
 
04:03:08.110 --> 04:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
for public sector employees are in fact
 
04:03:12.050 --> 04:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
infinitely lower than the private sector
 
04:03:14.689 --> 04:03:14.699 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I think that is a sad
 
04:03:16.370 --> 04:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
State of Affairs
 
04:03:18.410 --> 04:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not actually here to talk to you
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
about the principle of the matter
 
04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
although I think that in principle it's
 
04:03:24.410 --> 04:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
reasonable for people who sign up to
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
work for their governments are going to
 
04:03:29.450 --> 04:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
be treated fairly at least as fairly as
 
04:03:31.250 --> 04:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
the private sector I'm here to talk to
 
04:03:33.469 --> 04:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
you about something very practical we
 
04:03:36.889 --> 04:03:36.899 align:start position:0%
Face a workplace crisis
 
04:03:39.530 --> 04:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in the public sector
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
across all sectors in fact but over
 
04:03:44.689 --> 04:03:44.699 align:start position:0%
nearly two decades I have seen this
 
04:03:48.050 --> 04:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
firsthand that at the municipal level it
 
04:03:50.570 --> 04:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
is extremely difficult to find people to
 
04:03:54.170 --> 04:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
work in many of our departments and part
 
04:03:57.530 --> 04:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
of that is because we expect a lot from
 
04:03:59.570 --> 04:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
our public sector employees
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
they work in very dangerous jobs under
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
very dangerous conditions
 
04:04:07.610 --> 04:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
we have people who have to engage with
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
very dangerous chemicals who operate our
 
04:04:13.610 --> 04:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
water and sewer treatment systems we
 
04:04:16.370 --> 04:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
have people operating heavy equipment
 
04:04:20.570 --> 04:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
under very dangerous weather conditions
 
04:04:22.729 --> 04:04:22.739 align:start position:0%
we ask a lot of our public sector
 
04:04:26.090 --> 04:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
employees and they have options people
 
04:04:29.389 --> 04:04:29.399 align:start position:0%
oftentimes have to seek significant
 
04:04:33.469 --> 04:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
education licensing they have to spend
 
04:04:36.290 --> 04:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
their own money to become qualified for
 
04:04:39.229 --> 04:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
jobs and what I would suggest to you is
 
04:04:42.849 --> 04:04:42.859 align:start position:0%
that this bill is one way to equalize
 
04:04:45.830 --> 04:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
the workplace issues between the public
 
04:04:48.530 --> 04:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
sector and the private sector so that
 
04:04:50.330 --> 04:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
when people are looking at job
 
04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities there is not a an
 
04:04:55.849 --> 04:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
advantage to working in the private
 
04:04:58.189 --> 04:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
sector versus the public sector because
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
of safety conditions
 
04:05:04.250 --> 04:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
so I would just conclude by saying that
 
04:05:06.830 --> 04:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
I think having Clarity of Standards is
 
04:05:11.330 --> 04:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
helpful not just to employees uh and but
 
04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's also helpful to Employers
 
04:05:17.809 --> 04:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
in cities there are only 13 of us and
 
04:05:20.269 --> 04:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
yes we are very fortunate to have
 
04:05:23.090 --> 04:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
significant staff and professionals who
 
04:05:25.130 --> 04:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
are able to work with us on a lot of
 
04:05:27.170 --> 04:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
these things but in small communities
 
04:05:30.170 --> 04:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
can you imagine what it is like for the
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
select board in the town of was it
 
04:05:36.769 --> 04:05:36.779 align:start position:0%
Northfield those people
 
04:05:40.070 --> 04:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
feel a sense of responsibility for the
 
04:05:43.250 --> 04:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
death of someone who was under their
 
04:05:43.260 --> 04:05:45.410 align:start position:0%
death of someone who was under their
employment

04:05:45.410 --> 04:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:05:47.689 --> 04:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
people sign up in New Hampshire we have
 
04:05:50.750 --> 04:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
a wonderful tradition of local control
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
and government at the local level but
 
04:05:56.870 --> 04:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
these are volunteers who are not experts
 
04:06:01.969 --> 04:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
in workplace hazards and conditions and
 
04:06:04.370 --> 04:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
having this type of clarity of Standards
 
04:06:07.370 --> 04:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
helps to make sure that people who sign
 
04:06:07.380 --> 04:06:08.630 align:start position:0%
helps to make sure that people who sign
up

04:06:08.630 --> 04:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
to serve in local office have some
 
04:06:13.969 --> 04:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
guidance to make sure that they are
 
04:06:17.809 --> 04:06:17.819 align:start position:0%
providing a safe workplace environment
 
04:06:20.929 --> 04:06:20.939 align:start position:0%
for the people who work for the people
 
04:06:24.110 --> 04:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
of their community so I'm here in
 
04:06:27.170 --> 04:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and uh I think that
 
04:06:30.590 --> 04:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
it is not just a matter of principle but
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's also a matter of practical we need
 
04:06:37.070 --> 04:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
people to sign up and raise their hands
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
to work in local government and County
 
04:06:41.210 --> 04:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
government I didn't even mention that we
 
04:06:43.130 --> 04:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
have people in County government who are
 
04:06:45.010 --> 04:06:45.020 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
04:06:47.570 --> 04:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
Corrections who are responsible for
 
04:06:49.849 --> 04:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
people at the very end of their lives
 
04:06:52.189 --> 04:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
it's important for all of our public
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
sector employees to have to be protected
 
04:06:56.990 --> 04:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
and it's important for all of our public
 
04:07:00.590 --> 04:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
sector employers to have guidance on
 
04:07:02.929 --> 04:07:02.939 align:start position:0%
what those standards should be thank you
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:07:06.769 --> 04:07:06.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I I want to
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
ask the question that we asked a couple
 
04:07:10.610 --> 04:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
of the previous
 
04:07:13.370 --> 04:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
um people who were up certainly there
 
04:07:15.290 --> 04:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
are if there's a change to the law
 
04:07:17.929 --> 04:07:17.939 align:start position:0%
there's a reaction that has to be made
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
some examples given where rewriting
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
policy rewriting manuals revising
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
education from your perspective do you
 
04:07:30.530 --> 04:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
have any way of quantifying that cost
 
04:07:33.530 --> 04:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question I think it
 
04:07:35.210 --> 04:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
would be very different in the city of
 
04:07:38.090 --> 04:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
Lebanon than it would be for a small
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
town maybe
 
04:07:42.229 --> 04:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
um in in Grafton County I could think of
 
04:07:44.689 --> 04:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
maybe the town of orange which would be
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
significantly smaller
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
um so I think it would really vary from
 
04:07:50.750 --> 04:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
Community to community but I also know
 
04:07:52.849 --> 04:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
that we have a lot of really great
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state and that
 
04:07:57.349 --> 04:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
there would be a lot of resources
 
04:08:00.410 --> 04:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
available to cities and towns and public
 
04:08:01.729 --> 04:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
schools as well because I understand
 
04:08:03.290 --> 04:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
that they also are public sector
 
04:08:06.410 --> 04:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
employees so I am confident that there
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
are significant resources available that
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
would minimize the cost to local
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers all right thank you
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representative
 
04:08:17.929 --> 04:08:17.939 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
in your in your community do you hire
 
04:08:22.729 --> 04:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
people uh from the outside to do for
 
04:08:24.950 --> 04:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
instance road work volume private
 
04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:31.250 --> 04:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
so a private contract is a working in
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
your community
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
and are they covered by OSHA
 
04:08:39.290 --> 04:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding
 
04:08:41.570 --> 04:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
follow-up question uh though the public
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
sector workers that are working
 
04:08:45.469 --> 04:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
alongside them are working on the street
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
in another part of the street
 
04:08:49.130 --> 04:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh is that your understanding they're
 
04:08:50.809 --> 04:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
not covered by OSHA
 
04:08:53.809 --> 04:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
that is correct my understanding
 
04:08:58.910 --> 04:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:00.710 --> 04:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
04:09:02.750 --> 04:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony that was the
 
04:09:05.210 --> 04:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
last card that I had is there anyone
 
04:09:07.969 --> 04:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to speak Mr chairman
 
04:09:10.849 --> 04:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
I would like if we could have the
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor come back up and answer uh I'd
 
04:09:19.490 --> 04:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:19.500 --> 04:09:22.849 align:start position:0%
 
certainly

04:09:22.849 --> 04:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
as as long as it's an easy one yeah you
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
know if I understand that there was some
 
04:09:31.550 --> 04:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
question about the committee and uh the
 
04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
Outreach that was done by the committee
 
04:09:35.450 --> 04:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
and I think if I understood it right
 
04:09:39.110 --> 04:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
that the municipal Association uh and I
 
04:09:41.450 --> 04:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
don't want to State upon them but were
 
04:09:43.250 --> 04:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
they involved was everybody that was
 
04:09:46.130 --> 04:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
supposed to be at the table at the table
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
the committee actually got paused during
 
04:09:52.250 --> 04:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
the summer for the months of July and
 
04:09:52.260 --> 04:09:53.570 align:start position:0%
the summer for the months of July and
August

04:09:53.570 --> 04:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
August
 
04:09:57.130 --> 04:09:57.140 align:start position:0%
um we were not aware that uh
 
04:09:59.950 --> 04:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
well the the speaker's rule was
 
04:10:03.050 --> 04:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
statutory committees can continue to
 
04:10:07.309 --> 04:10:07.319 align:start position:0%
meet but other committees could not
 
04:10:10.849 --> 04:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
um since this committee was set up by a
 
04:10:14.689 --> 04:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
uh a bill I thought it was statutory we
 
04:10:18.110 --> 04:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
thought it was statutory it was not
 
04:10:19.849 --> 04:10:19.859 align:start position:0%
um so I was informed by the clerk that
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
we had to stop meeting so we probably
 
04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
would have involved more people if we'd
 
04:10:28.010 --> 04:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
had July and August to do that I do I do
 
04:10:30.769 --> 04:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
know that representative avalani has
 
04:10:32.110 --> 04:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
been um
 
04:10:35.150 --> 04:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
he had concerns about the small towns
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
and such
 
04:10:38.450 --> 04:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
um and has been in touch with you know
 
04:10:40.969 --> 04:10:40.979 align:start position:0%
he lives up north
 
04:10:43.210 --> 04:10:43.220 align:start position:0%
um and has a lot of small towns that he
 
04:10:45.290 --> 04:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
works with
 
04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
and he's been communicating with them
 
04:10:50.090 --> 04:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
um on this bill and the feedback he's
 
04:10:53.570 --> 04:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
gotten is they say as soon as he tells
 
04:10:55.370 --> 04:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
them that it's still just our department
 
04:10:57.290 --> 04:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
of labor that's going to be doing the
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement it's not going to be OSHA
 
04:11:02.210 --> 04:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
they say that's fine we're fine with
 
04:11:04.969 --> 04:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
enhanced standards as long as it's still
 
04:11:07.250 --> 04:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
our department of labor that's uh that's
 
04:11:09.769 --> 04:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
going to be doing the enforcement I
 
04:11:12.950 --> 04:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
would also point out that our department
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
of labor is not highly punitive
 
04:11:18.650 --> 04:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
um they work with employers all the time
 
04:11:21.650 --> 04:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
so if they came in and they've found
 
04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
that you know there are standards that
 
04:11:26.090 --> 04:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
needed to be uh are not standards but
 
04:11:28.370 --> 04:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
conditions that needed to be adjusted to
 
04:11:31.010 --> 04:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
meet the standards they don't come down
 
04:11:33.490 --> 04:11:33.500 align:start position:0%
with both feet and start finding and
 
04:11:36.530 --> 04:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
punishing they basically say this needs
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
to be addressed
 
04:11:37.920 --> 04:11:39.769 align:start position:0%
to be addressed
um

04:11:39.769 --> 04:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
four years ago when I put my first bill
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
in there was a question raised about
 
04:11:47.650 --> 04:11:47.660 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates and essentially
 
04:11:50.570 --> 04:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
enforcing the current safety standards
 
04:11:54.769 --> 04:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
can result in unfunded mandates forcing
 
04:11:58.130 --> 04:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
towns or other public employers to
 
04:12:02.750 --> 04:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
improve to pay some type of money in
 
04:12:04.729 --> 04:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
order to enhance their standards or
 
04:12:06.490 --> 04:12:06.500 align:start position:0%
enhance their conditions
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
and what the department would typically
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
do is they'd say we know we can't
 
04:12:12.889 --> 04:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
mandate you to spend money now but we'll
 
04:12:14.330 --> 04:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
work with you
 
04:12:17.210 --> 04:12:17.220 align:start position:0%
the safety standards are important you
 
04:12:19.790 --> 04:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
need to adhere to them but if if you
 
04:12:21.469 --> 04:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
need to go another budget cycle before
 
04:12:23.870 --> 04:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
you can put in this lighting or whatever
 
04:12:25.370 --> 04:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
is needed
 
04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
we'll work with you on that and here's
 
04:12:29.150 --> 04:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
what we'd like you to do to mitigate in
 
04:12:31.610 --> 04:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
the meantime you know to make sure that
 
04:12:33.650 --> 04:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
the conditions are as safe as possible
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
but the ultimate adjustment might be
 
04:12:40.130 --> 04:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
delayed a little bit simply because
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
um that's the way that department works
 
04:12:46.189 --> 04:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
it's uh it is not dishing out twenty
 
04:12:48.410 --> 04:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollar fines uh willy-nilly
 
04:12:50.570 --> 04:12:50.580 align:start position:0%
just because they can they work with
 
04:12:50.580 --> 04:12:52.610 align:start position:0%
just because they can they work with
employers

04:12:52.610 --> 04:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
employers
 
04:12:55.990 --> 04:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
any other easy questions
 
04:12:58.130 --> 04:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative colcum
 
04:13:03.530 --> 04:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know the different thoughts through
 
04:13:08.150 --> 04:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
my head one being worked on the private
 
04:13:10.370 --> 04:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
sector do as I say not as I do when it
 
04:13:13.370 --> 04:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
comes to the public sector but I do want
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
to ask is this bill
 
04:13:19.550 --> 04:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
is this bill violating article 28a
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
that was the issue I was just addressing
 
04:13:25.130 --> 04:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
and essentially one could argue that
 
04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
enforcing our current safety standards
 
04:13:32.689 --> 04:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
might violate 28a but the department
 
04:13:36.889 --> 04:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
gets around it by being flexible being
 
04:13:40.150 --> 04:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
helpful to employers and essentially
 
04:13:44.510 --> 04:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
this would make our our workplaces safer
 
04:13:46.130 --> 04:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't make our department of
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:53.210 --> 04:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
04:13:53.220 --> 04:13:53.870 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
um

04:13:53.870 --> 04:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:55.550 --> 04:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm not understand that so I
 
04:13:57.050 --> 04:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
apologize I wasn't so much speaking of
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
the punitive part for the violations I'm
 
04:14:01.969 --> 04:14:01.979 align:start position:0%
speaking more from the beginning as far
 
04:14:03.650 --> 04:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
as ramping up and getting all the safety
 
04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
gear and implementing the requirements
 
04:14:09.889 --> 04:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
needed for them to be in compliance with
 
04:14:12.590 --> 04:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
what the private sector is doing today I
 
04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:20.210 --> 04:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:14:23.450 --> 04:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
we've heard a few questions about costs
 
04:14:23.460 --> 04:14:25.070 align:start position:0%
we've heard a few questions about costs
well

04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:14:28.790 --> 04:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
what would it cost a small town or city
 
04:14:30.889 --> 04:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
or I mean I might have asked the city
 
04:14:33.410 --> 04:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
councilor but she had a case but
 
04:14:35.929 --> 04:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
what would the savings be if we
 
04:14:38.030 --> 04:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
prevented an injury
 
04:14:40.130 --> 04:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
workers comp cases can go into the
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars
 
04:14:46.210 --> 04:14:46.220 align:start position:0%
and if a two thousand dollar
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
safety feature would save a huge workers
 
04:14:52.370 --> 04:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
Comm case that's not a cost that's a
 
04:14:52.380 --> 04:14:53.929 align:start position:0%
Comm case that's not a cost that's a
savings

04:14:53.929 --> 04:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
savings
 
04:14:56.150 --> 04:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
would you agree did you talk to anybody
 
04:14:59.330 --> 04:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
that might have information on something
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
like that part of what the study
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee did do is we invited OSHA the
 
04:15:08.929 --> 04:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
Boston office of Osha we've met remotely
 
04:15:12.410 --> 04:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
but they had I think five uh five
 
04:15:14.450 --> 04:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
members of their staff who came and they
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
were adamant that when safety standards
 
04:15:20.389 --> 04:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
are improved when workplace safety
 
04:15:20.399 --> 04:15:22.790 align:start position:0%
are improved when workplace safety
improves

04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
improves
 
04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
um money is always saved the they've
 
04:15:28.969 --> 04:15:28.979 align:start position:0%
done multiple studies on this and they
 
04:15:31.849 --> 04:15:31.859 align:start position:0%
have found that improving safety saves
 
04:15:31.859 --> 04:15:33.110 align:start position:0%
have found that improving safety saves
money

04:15:33.110 --> 04:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:15:35.929 --> 04:15:35.939 align:start position:0%
um and I think someone earlier said
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
um that uh they're worried about
 
04:15:40.670 --> 04:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
short-term impacts
 
04:15:40.680 --> 04:15:41.450 align:start position:0%
short-term impacts
um

04:15:41.450 --> 04:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:43.729 --> 04:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
I think this bill looks to long-term
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
impacts this is a long-term effort to
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
improve worker safety for public sector
 
04:15:51.710 --> 04:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
workers and knowing how the Department
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
of Labor Works they will help people get
 
04:15:57.650 --> 04:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
there and once we're there the state
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:04.250 --> 04:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
04:16:06.050 --> 04:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for coming up
 
04:16:10.309 --> 04:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
again and I will close the hearing on uh
 
04:16:12.410 --> 04:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
let's go
 
04:16:15.650 --> 04:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
there will be a subcommittee
 
04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
on this bill and the members will be
 
04:16:20.510 --> 04:16:20.520 align:start position:0%

subcommittee I would appreciate if you
 
04:16:28.189 --> 04:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
could meet no more than twice for
 
04:16:32.210 --> 04:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
probably two hours of Peter each time to
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
allow people to get more
 
04:16:34.800 --> 04:16:35.389 align:start position:0%
allow people to get more
um

04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:38.210 --> 04:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
specific on to some of the concerns they
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:45.479 --> 04:16:54.349 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:16:54.349 --> 04:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:54.359 --> 04:17:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:19.729 --> 04:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:19.739 --> 04:17:20.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:17:20.450 --> 04:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:28.610 --> 04:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.050 --> 04:17:35.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.150 --> 04:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
is this on the air yes uh we are oh well
 
04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to open the hearing on
 
04:17:45.950 --> 04:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 150
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%

ortus boards how do you pronounce it sir
 
04:17:51.359 --> 04:17:52.969 align:start position:0%
ortus boards how do you pronounce it sir
words

04:17:52.969 --> 04:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
words
 
04:17:52.979 --> 04:17:56.389 align:start position:0%
words
welcome

04:17:56.389 --> 04:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:58.370 --> 04:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
good day members of the committee and Mr
 
04:18:00.650 --> 04:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm here today to introduce
 
04:18:04.130 --> 04:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
house bill 150. this is a really a
 
04:18:06.229 --> 04:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
simple bill it reduces the minimum
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
number of employees required to start uh
 
04:18:11.330 --> 04:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
required to certify a collective
 
04:18:14.450 --> 04:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit from 10 to 5. this is a
 
04:18:16.670 --> 04:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Bill we have an equal amount
 
04:18:19.189 --> 04:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
of Democrats and Republicans as sponsors
 
04:18:20.929 --> 04:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
04:18:22.189 --> 04:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
um the bill is important because
 
04:18:24.290 --> 04:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention is currently
 
04:18:27.530 --> 04:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
at an all-time low for many of our fire
 
04:18:30.050 --> 04:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
Services police services and such I know
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
you are aware of
 
04:18:33.410 --> 04:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
um this bill would give firefighters
 
04:18:35.929 --> 04:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
EMTs and other public employees a seat
 
04:18:38.929 --> 04:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
at the table to negotiate Fair wages
 
04:18:40.809 --> 04:18:40.819 align:start position:0%
amongst them
 
04:18:44.090 --> 04:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
as well as they're working at working
 
04:18:46.670 --> 04:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
conditions hours which subsequently will
 
04:18:48.830 --> 04:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
make careers in public safety more
 
04:18:51.769 --> 04:18:51.779 align:start position:0%
attractive for people to uh come on
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
board and sign up
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
the professional firefighters office
 
04:18:57.950 --> 04:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
services and resources that are
 
04:18:59.689 --> 04:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
available to members including but not
 
04:19:01.849 --> 04:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
limited to Kia support supplemental
 
04:19:03.889 --> 04:19:03.899 align:start position:0%
retirement supplemental health insurance
 
04:19:06.170 --> 04:19:06.180 align:start position:0%
financial support for families of Fallen
 
04:19:08.269 --> 04:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
firefighters legal support and
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
retirement assistance uh firefighters
 
04:19:14.210 --> 04:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
tend to be not become members if they
 
04:19:16.250 --> 04:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
cannot certify a collective bargaining
 
04:19:19.370 --> 04:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
unit this also pertains to other local
 
04:19:22.510 --> 04:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
services in the municipalities and such
 
04:19:25.610 --> 04:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
it's just a basic Bill cutting the
 
04:19:29.150 --> 04:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
number required from ten to five now
 
04:19:31.370 --> 04:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
there's some misinterpretations of what
 
04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
this does it does not remove their
 
04:19:35.389 --> 04:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
ability for Public Employee Labor
 
04:19:37.490 --> 04:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
Relations Board to consider the effect
 
04:19:40.130 --> 04:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
of forming any particular unit
 
04:19:41.750 --> 04:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
on the efficiency of government
 
04:19:44.889 --> 04:19:44.899 align:start position:0%
operations under RSA
 
04:19:48.590 --> 04:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
273-a-1 on colon 1. it does not change
 
04:19:50.990 --> 04:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
any other requirements for determining a
 
04:19:52.370 --> 04:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit
 
04:19:53.929 --> 04:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
it would not create significant
 
04:19:56.570 --> 04:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
financial burden on cities and towns as
 
04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
the impact of bargaining with smaller
 
04:20:00.769 --> 04:20:00.779 align:start position:0%
units would have minimal impact on their
 
04:20:00.779 --> 04:20:02.229 align:start position:0%
units would have minimal impact on their
finances

04:20:02.229 --> 04:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
finances
 
04:20:05.330 --> 04:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
the current requirement of 10 members is
 
04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
just an arbitrary number
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
um part of my slurring them one of those
 
04:20:11.330 --> 04:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
days I've been shoveling all morning
 
04:20:13.849 --> 04:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
like most of you so I'm still sweating
 
04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
from it
 
04:20:17.389 --> 04:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
um I mean honestly this is just a pretty
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
basic Bill reducing the number from ten
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
to five as I said numerous times and
 
04:20:24.290 --> 04:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
it's just it makes common sense with the
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention issues we're
 
04:20:25.800 --> 04:20:27.469 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention issues we're
having

04:20:27.469 --> 04:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
having
 
04:20:29.870 --> 04:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
pretty simple basic explanation of the
 
04:20:29.880 --> 04:20:32.389 align:start position:0%
pretty simple basic explanation of the
bill

04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:33.889 --> 04:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony there any
 
04:20:37.969 --> 04:20:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.150 --> 04:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
Mr representative McKenzie thank you uh
 
04:20:42.769 --> 04:20:42.779 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the number of
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
employees needed in the private sector
 
04:20:46.370 --> 04:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
to organize the Union
 
04:20:48.710 --> 04:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
I do not know that exact number off the
 
04:20:50.570 --> 04:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
top of my head I apologize
 
04:20:53.990 --> 04:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's two two okay so in the in the okay
 
04:20:54.000 --> 04:20:56.389 align:start position:0%
it's two two okay so in the in the okay
yeah

04:20:56.389 --> 04:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:56.399 --> 04:20:58.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:20:58.030 --> 04:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
any other any additional questions I
 
04:21:06.110 --> 04:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
have a question I asked research to um
 
04:21:09.530 --> 04:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
explain to me when the last time this
 
04:21:11.150 --> 04:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
was changed and why
 
04:21:14.269 --> 04:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
so my understanding was in the 70s this
 
04:21:15.889 --> 04:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
bill was
 
04:21:15.899 --> 04:21:17.090 align:start position:0%
bill was
um

04:21:17.090 --> 04:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
10 individuals it was moved to five some
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
time in the well I can't seem to find my
 
04:21:26.450 --> 04:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
email you're shaking your head at me and
 
04:21:29.570 --> 04:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
do you have that uh
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
please I have so many emails in my
 
04:21:34.910 --> 04:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
legislative box here I can't find it I
 
04:21:36.410 --> 04:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm supposed to look at it
 
04:21:40.969 --> 04:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:40.979 --> 04:21:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:21:41.990 --> 04:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:43.550 --> 04:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
because it had been changed in my
 
04:21:45.229 --> 04:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
understanding and it was just
 
04:21:46.610 --> 04:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
give me a second any other questions
 
04:21:48.710 --> 04:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
while I find this email I can read the
 
04:21:50.689 --> 04:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
history of this Mr McKenzie you have
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:59.150 --> 04:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would just uh
 
04:22:02.929 --> 04:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
uh in in response to your comments that
 
04:22:04.490 --> 04:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'm probably one of the few people
 
04:22:06.469 --> 04:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
around that was in the room when this
 
04:22:09.410 --> 04:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
was passed in 1974 75. so that's why I
 
04:22:10.849 --> 04:22:10.859 align:start position:0%
called on it
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
um in the uh and it was an arbitrary
 
04:22:15.290 --> 04:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
number that was established with for 10
 
04:22:17.809 --> 04:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
employees it was there was no Rhyme or
 
04:22:20.229 --> 04:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
Reason for it the federal sector was two
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
and uh it was I believe it was the uh
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the cities and towns
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
probably come in at that time but there
 
04:22:29.870 --> 04:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
was no Rhyme or Reason for that number
 
04:22:31.969 --> 04:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
it's picked out of the year
 
04:22:34.610 --> 04:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
all right I will read you thank you
 
04:22:34.620 --> 04:22:36.650 align:start position:0%
all right I will read you thank you
um

04:22:36.650 --> 04:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:38.210 --> 04:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
and I know I'm trying to make this
 
04:22:40.490 --> 04:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
question if all our rules here folks um
 
04:22:42.769 --> 04:22:42.779 align:start position:0%
I did ask the question
 
04:22:42.779 --> 04:22:44.630 align:start position:0%
I did ask the question
um

04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
when the election collective bargaining
 
04:22:50.229 --> 04:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
Republic employees statue was enacted in
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
1975. it required 10 employees in order
 
04:22:55.550 --> 04:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
to certify a group of collecting bargain
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
unit the minimum allowed changed in 2008
 
04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
but went back to 10 in 2011.
 
04:23:06.889 --> 04:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
when fewer than 10 were required it was
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
up to the employer whether to allow a
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
smaller unit
 
04:23:13.010 --> 04:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
one last amended 10 employees was
 
04:23:15.410 --> 04:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
referred to as the standard to which the
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor requested a return
 
04:23:19.610 --> 04:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
but there's no other discussion with a
 
04:23:22.130 --> 04:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
particular number came from so is it
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
still that
 
04:23:24.359 --> 04:23:25.670 align:start position:0%
still that
where

04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:23:29.689 --> 04:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:33.170 --> 04:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
however if the employer agrees to a
 
04:23:36.410 --> 04:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:39.590 --> 04:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
um it could be as little as two I
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
believe if that's the way the RSA was
 
04:23:42.889 --> 04:23:42.899 align:start position:0%
written and the law was written that
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
would be accurate
 
04:23:44.399 --> 04:23:45.349 align:start position:0%
would be accurate
um

04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:47.269 --> 04:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
so I guess they leave it up to the
 
04:23:49.070 --> 04:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
employee but
 
04:23:51.530 --> 04:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
ten five it's an arbitrary number I I
 
04:23:54.170 --> 04:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
think five is a fair number to uh form a
 
04:23:57.530 --> 04:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:02.929 --> 04:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
04:24:04.969 --> 04:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
would be five regardless of whether it's
 
04:24:06.530 --> 04:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
private or public
 
04:24:10.490 --> 04:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
I believe so correct yes okay
 
04:24:14.330 --> 04:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:16.849 --> 04:24:16.859 align:start position:0%
back when I represented teachers
 
04:24:16.859 --> 04:24:17.870 align:start position:0%
back when I represented teachers
um

04:24:17.870 --> 04:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:19.250 --> 04:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
we would
 
04:24:22.729 --> 04:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
um sometimes around a little bit when I
 
04:24:24.530 --> 04:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
get a phone call saying we'd like to um
 
04:24:26.990 --> 04:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
organize I said number one you have to
 
04:24:28.849 --> 04:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
be able to count to ten
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
um if you can't count to ten you can't
 
04:24:30.239 --> 04:24:31.790 align:start position:0%
um if you can't count to ten you can't
organize

04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
organize
 
04:24:31.800 --> 04:24:33.050 align:start position:0%
organize
um

04:24:33.050 --> 04:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:34.670 --> 04:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
would you
 
04:24:34.680 --> 04:24:36.110 align:start position:0%
would you
um

04:24:36.110 --> 04:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:38.929 --> 04:24:38.939 align:start position:0%
understand the frustration when they
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
started counting and came to eight eight
 
04:24:44.510 --> 04:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
oh I could definitely understand that
 
04:24:46.729 --> 04:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
frustration because they're too off and
 
04:24:48.530 --> 04:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
if the law was five they would have been
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
able to form
 
04:24:53.630 --> 04:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:55.309 --> 04:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
representative broody
 
04:24:58.510 --> 04:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I work for our
 
04:25:00.769 --> 04:25:00.779 align:start position:0%
newspaper in Massachusetts and it was
 
04:25:01.969 --> 04:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
two of us
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
and we were represented but um what
 
04:25:09.170 --> 04:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
would prevent a small group of people
 
04:25:13.070 --> 04:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
from joining a larger group
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
and and have them represent them like we
 
04:25:19.729 --> 04:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
did there was two of us and we joined
 
04:25:23.870 --> 04:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
the Boston local and he represented us
 
04:25:25.790 --> 04:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of people do have that
 
04:25:27.950 --> 04:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
option to my understanding but I think
 
04:25:30.769 --> 04:25:30.779 align:start position:0%
having a more local tight-knit group
 
04:25:32.689 --> 04:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
would be more beneficial because they
 
04:25:34.370 --> 04:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
understand their positions they
 
04:25:36.349 --> 04:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
understand their tasks and I just think
 
04:25:38.450 --> 04:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
it would be more beneficial to have a
 
04:25:40.849 --> 04:25:40.859 align:start position:0%
more locally managed than on a high
 
04:25:40.859 --> 04:25:44.389 align:start position:0%
more locally managed than on a high
level

04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:48.110 --> 04:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just point of information
 
04:25:48.120 --> 04:25:48.710 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman just point of information
um

04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:51.410 --> 04:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
this is only for the public sector this
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
says no you have no jurisdiction uh
 
04:25:56.090 --> 04:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
Public Employee and Labor Relations lost
 
04:25:57.590 --> 04:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
no jurisdiction in the private sector
 
04:26:00.649 --> 04:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
right that is pretty accurate correct I
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
stay incorrected on that I'm sorry I'm
 
04:26:02.640 --> 04:26:03.830 align:start position:0%
stay incorrected on that I'm sorry I'm
sorry

04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:26:06.590 --> 04:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
the vice chairman corrected RSA 273 a
 
04:26:08.450 --> 04:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
colon 8 is Public Employee Labor
 
04:26:08.460 --> 04:26:11.750 align:start position:0%

just just another point of information
 
04:26:22.010 --> 04:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
as long as we're on the topic in in the
 
04:26:25.429 --> 04:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
public sector you if an employer if a
 
04:26:28.610 --> 04:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
single employer only has eight employees
 
04:26:31.250 --> 04:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's what that's where the issue would
 
04:26:31.260 --> 04:26:32.030 align:start position:0%
that's what that's where the issue would
be

04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
um you can't join with another school
 
04:26:36.469 --> 04:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
district another town another County
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
um that uh if if there's a job
 
04:26:42.229 --> 04:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
classification of eight people under a
 
04:26:44.210 --> 04:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
single employer that's where the
 
04:26:46.010 --> 04:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
limitation comes in
 
04:26:50.030 --> 04:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:26:53.210 --> 04:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony

04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
we have no additional pink cards that
 
04:27:03.410 --> 04:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of whatever like to speak oh
 
04:27:11.929 --> 04:27:11.939 align:start position:0%

McAllister
 
04:27:15.710 --> 04:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
04:27:17.990 --> 04:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
you could do you is this what this is
 
04:27:20.030 --> 04:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
here I don't think
 
04:27:21.649 --> 04:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
yes it's it
 
04:27:24.290 --> 04:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
let me get it no no it's not if you
 
04:27:25.309 --> 04:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
could do one of those little pink things
 
04:27:26.510 --> 04:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards I'd appreciate I guess we
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
either lost it or absolutely I apologize
 
04:27:30.050 --> 04:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
I thought that that would have been
 
04:27:32.929 --> 04:27:32.939 align:start position:0%
submitted I I I also apologize for the
 
04:27:34.250 --> 04:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
mix-up this morning because I guess my

04:28:13.790 --> 04:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
Daily
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
I am here today to speak in favor and
 
04:28:18.110 --> 04:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
sorry in support of House Bill 150
 
04:28:19.969 --> 04:28:19.979 align:start position:0%
relative to the certification of
 
04:28:21.710 --> 04:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining unit
 
04:28:24.170 --> 04:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
in doing so I want to talk briefly about
 
04:28:25.729 --> 04:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
the importance of collective bargaining
 
04:28:27.110 --> 04:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to the fire
 
04:28:27.120 --> 04:28:28.490 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to the fire
service

04:28:28.490 --> 04:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
in most circumstances there is power in
 
04:28:30.960 --> 04:28:31.849 align:start position:0%
in most circumstances there is power in
numbers

04:28:31.849 --> 04:28:31.859 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
04:28:33.649 --> 04:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
when large groups of individuals get
 
04:28:35.570 --> 04:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
together there is often the ability to
 
04:28:37.070 --> 04:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish goals and Achieve results
 
04:28:40.370 --> 04:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
that would not be possible with just the
 
04:28:42.229 --> 04:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
work of one or two people
 
04:28:43.910 --> 04:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
in that sense collective bargaining is
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
important because it allows a group of
 
04:28:46.670 --> 04:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
people to come together
 
04:28:48.410 --> 04:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
through common goals and circumstances
 
04:28:50.030 --> 04:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
and work to achieve an outcome that
 
04:28:52.610 --> 04:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
benefits all members of that group
 
04:28:54.649 --> 04:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
as you know New Hampshire is made up of
 
04:28:56.510 --> 04:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of small towns
 
04:28:58.250 --> 04:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
most of the fire departments in these
 
04:29:00.349 --> 04:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
communities consist of less than 10
 
04:29:02.149 --> 04:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
full-time members
 
04:29:04.250 --> 04:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
at this time New Hampshire law does not
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
allow groups of less than 10 individuals
 
04:29:08.689 --> 04:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
to form a collective bargaining unit
 
04:29:10.429 --> 04:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
this puts the firefighters in these
 
04:29:12.050 --> 04:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
small towns at a disadvantage because
 
04:29:15.530 --> 04:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
they are not able to negotiate benefits
 
04:29:18.889 --> 04:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
or collectively bargain wages
 
04:29:20.929 --> 04:29:20.939 align:start position:0%
by decreasing the number of employees
 
04:29:22.969 --> 04:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
required to form a collective bargaining
 
04:29:24.830 --> 04:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
unit from ten to five
 
04:29:26.929 --> 04:29:26.939 align:start position:0%
House Bill 150 would allow these small
 
04:29:28.790 --> 04:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
town employees the opportunity to band
 
04:29:28.800 --> 04:29:29.750 align:start position:0%
town employees the opportunity to band
together

04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:29:31.610 --> 04:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
to Advocate and negotiate for common
 
04:29:31.620 --> 04:29:32.630 align:start position:0%
to Advocate and negotiate for common
goals

04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
goals
 
04:29:36.050 --> 04:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
such as Fair wages adequate benefits but
 
04:29:37.309 --> 04:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
most importantly
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
safe working conditions
 
04:29:41.570 --> 04:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
additionally at a time when the
 
04:29:42.530 --> 04:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention of
 
04:29:45.170 --> 04:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
firefighters is at extremely low
 
04:29:46.849 --> 04:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
the ability to collectively bargain
 
04:29:49.550 --> 04:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
would make careers in public safety more
 
04:29:51.649 --> 04:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
attractive to new recruits and qualified
 
04:29:51.659 --> 04:29:55.790 align:start position:0%
attractive to new recruits and qualified
candidates

04:29:55.790 --> 04:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:57.710 --> 04:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
in addition to being able to negotiate a
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
fair contract I want to point out
 
04:30:01.130 --> 04:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
another very important benefit that
 
04:30:02.330 --> 04:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
comes with being able to form a
 
04:30:04.010 --> 04:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining unit
 
04:30:05.929 --> 04:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
that is the ability for firefighters in
 
04:30:07.130 --> 04:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
these small communities to take
 
04:30:08.929 --> 04:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
advantage of services offered by the
 
04:30:09.950 --> 04:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
International Association of
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
firefighters the iaff
 
04:30:14.630 --> 04:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
by forming a collective bargaining unit
 
04:30:16.729 --> 04:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
small local organizations will be
 
04:30:19.910 --> 04:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for representation by the iaff
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
most importantly it will allow these
 
04:30:23.689 --> 04:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
locals to access a wide array of
 
04:30:27.170 --> 04:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
benefits that the iaff and the pffnh
 
04:30:29.510 --> 04:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
offer to their members
 
04:30:31.490 --> 04:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
this includes programs such as peer
 
04:30:31.500 --> 04:30:32.450 align:start position:0%
this includes programs such as peer
support

04:30:32.450 --> 04:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
cancer prevention legal support retiree
 
04:30:39.769 --> 04:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
assistance supplemental insurance and
 
04:30:41.269 --> 04:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
financial support for families of
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
members who have died in the line of
 
04:30:42.720 --> 04:30:44.929 align:start position:0%
members who have died in the line of
duty

04:30:44.929 --> 04:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
duty
 
04:30:46.790 --> 04:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
personally I cannot stress enough how
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
much the covert pandemic has impacted
 
04:30:50.809 --> 04:30:50.819 align:start position:0%
First Responders and has taken a toll on
 
04:30:52.910 --> 04:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
the mental health of our firefighters
 
04:30:54.649 --> 04:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
the ability to belong to an organization
 
04:30:56.210 --> 04:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
that offers support
 
04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
care and options for treatment for these
 
04:31:00.769 --> 04:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
individuals in a is an asset that is
 
04:31:00.779 --> 04:31:02.630 align:start position:0%
individuals in a is an asset that is
invaluable

04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
invaluable
 
04:31:04.250 --> 04:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
I also want to point out that a
 
04:31:05.929 --> 04:31:05.939 align:start position:0%
reduction to five employees to form a
 
04:31:07.309 --> 04:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining unit is not
 
04:31:07.319 --> 04:31:08.510 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining unit is not
unprecedented

04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
unprecedented
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
currently the iaff allows groups of
 
04:31:13.070 --> 04:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
three or more to become affiliated with
 
04:31:15.290 --> 04:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
a local iaff
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
in Most states these three member locals
 
04:31:19.010 --> 04:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
are able to collectively bargain within
 
04:31:20.210 --> 04:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
their community
 
04:31:21.889 --> 04:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
this gives them the opportunity to
 
04:31:23.809 --> 04:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
represent by to be represented by a
 
04:31:26.090 --> 04:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
larger group of a group of individuals
 
04:31:27.830 --> 04:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
who understands their issues and
 
04:31:27.840 --> 04:31:28.849 align:start position:0%
who understands their issues and
concerns

04:31:28.849 --> 04:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
because the iaff and the pffnh are
 
04:31:33.170 --> 04:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
comprised of individuals
 
04:31:34.910 --> 04:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
who have been in their shoes
 
04:31:36.889 --> 04:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
and who have experienced Life as a first
 
04:31:39.769 --> 04:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
responder first hand on a daily basis
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
and of course it gives firefighters in
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
these small communities a seat at the
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
table a collective voice when
 
04:31:47.929 --> 04:31:47.939 align:start position:0%
negotiating contracts and establishing
 
04:31:50.269 --> 04:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
safe working conditions
 
04:31:51.710 --> 04:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
it is for these reasons that I
 
04:31:53.210 --> 04:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask for your support of
 
04:31:56.269 --> 04:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
house bill 150. I have also submitted
 
04:31:58.490 --> 04:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
written testimony in and happy to answer
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
any questions the committee may have
 
04:32:07.370 --> 04:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.769 --> 04:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
if you have written testimony that you'd
 
04:32:11.929 --> 04:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
like to provide the clerk would
 
04:32:13.610 --> 04:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
appreciate it absolutely
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
or any questions for the presenter
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
I do
 
04:32:21.170 --> 04:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
you had me at first
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
and then you made a comment and it's
 
04:32:25.070 --> 04:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
really rubbing me wrong and I need to
 
04:32:26.689 --> 04:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
04:32:28.610 --> 04:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
is it your testimony that you believe
 
04:32:31.849 --> 04:32:31.859 align:start position:0%
these people firefighters under 10 do
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
not have good working conditions and
 
04:32:36.050 --> 04:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.670 --> 04:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I think I think that the ability to
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
collectively bargain will help
 
04:32:42.410 --> 04:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
address those issues if they if they
 
04:32:44.990 --> 04:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
have those issues
 
04:32:47.149 --> 04:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:47.159 --> 04:32:59.090 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

04:32:59.090 --> 04:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
being and being the current law have you
 
04:33:04.250 --> 04:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
faced a situation where uh the employees
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
drop below the 10 and their unit was
 
04:33:08.810 --> 04:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
challenged we have
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
and what was the experience there what
 
04:33:12.650 --> 04:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
what actually happened in that case well
 
04:33:14.689 --> 04:33:14.699 align:start position:0%
we currently have
 
04:33:17.150 --> 04:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
two locals within those 42 locals that
 
04:33:18.769 --> 04:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
are unable to collectively bargain
 
04:33:20.570 --> 04:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
because they fall below that number 10.
 
04:33:22.670 --> 04:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
we also had a local
 
04:33:25.670 --> 04:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
wolf Pearl was affiliated with the iaff
 
04:33:27.890 --> 04:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
they had a chartered member I mean they
 
04:33:29.869 --> 04:33:29.879 align:start position:0%
were a chartered unit
 
04:33:32.150 --> 04:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
they were part of the association for
 
04:33:35.269 --> 04:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
many years they they were held at eight
 
04:33:38.090 --> 04:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
for many years they couldn't never get
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
to that 10. even though the town voted
 
04:33:43.849 --> 04:33:43.859 align:start position:0%
to increase the Manpower in that in that
 
04:33:46.609 --> 04:33:46.619 align:start position:0%
town they could not get there
 
04:33:49.631 --> 04:33:49.641 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Wolfeboro ended up
 
04:33:52.670 --> 04:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
resigning their Charter with the iaff
 
04:33:54.769 --> 04:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
they ended up forming with afscme
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
joining afscme within the town of
 
04:33:58.849 --> 04:33:58.859 align:start position:0%
wolfbro to be able to actually get a
 
04:34:00.830 --> 04:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
contract and that and that's the number
 
04:34:02.631 --> 04:34:02.641 align:start position:0%
one reason for this this bill that we're
 
04:34:06.410 --> 04:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
submitting is situations like Wolfeboro
 
04:34:08.810 --> 04:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro was a was a
 
04:34:11.689 --> 04:34:11.699 align:start position:0%
was represented by the iaff they fell
 
04:34:13.189 --> 04:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
within the professional firefighters of
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:34:16.970 --> 04:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
and they were advocated we were
 
04:34:19.490 --> 04:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
advocating we had we had members who did
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
their job advocating for them on a
 
04:34:22.670 --> 04:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
04:34:24.769 --> 04:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
because they could not get to that 10
 
04:34:26.810 --> 04:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
number they could not collectively
 
04:34:28.490 --> 04:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
bargain they could not negotiate a
 
04:34:28.500 --> 04:34:30.709 align:start position:0%
bargain they could not negotiate a
contract

04:34:30.709 --> 04:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
contract
 
04:34:33.230 --> 04:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
they ended up as I said resigning their
 
04:34:36.709 --> 04:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
Charter in in and joining afscme since
 
04:34:39.410 --> 04:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
then they have gotten a contract and
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
they have reached that they because of
 
04:34:43.070 --> 04:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
of collective bargaining have got to
 
04:34:46.010 --> 04:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
that number 10.
 
04:34:46.020 --> 04:34:49.789 align:start position:0%
that number 10.
foreign

04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%

04:35:04.070 --> 04:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
I have no other pink cards is there

04:35:13.310 --> 04:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
seeing that I'm closing the hearing on

05:02:35.280 --> 05:02:37.128 align:start position:0%
started because my mother called me and
said

05:02:37.128 --> 05:02:37.138 align:start position:0%
said
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
let's go we'll get going
 
05:02:42.170 --> 05:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna hope the hearing on House
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
Bill 125.
 
05:02:46.190 --> 05:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
and one of these days I'll remember to
 
05:02:48.410 --> 05:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
bring my gavel and I call Representative
 
05:02:51.050 --> 05:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
Mike Cahill
 
05:02:53.810 --> 05:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
05:02:58.010 --> 05:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.788 --> 05:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
uh you know at our at our first meeting
 
05:03:04.250 --> 05:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
this term the chairman talked about that
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes we make mistakes
 
05:03:09.590 --> 05:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
and we might want to fix them and so I'm
 
05:03:12.050 --> 05:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
going to go back in the way back machine
 
05:03:15.230 --> 05:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
to uh 2018 to
 
05:03:16.910 --> 05:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
05:03:18.410 --> 05:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's that's the beginning of the
 
05:03:21.470 --> 05:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
problem Senate bill 318.
 
05:03:23.990 --> 05:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
and this is where
 
05:03:25.730 --> 05:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
it was a pretty good system for
 
05:03:27.470 --> 05:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
controlling you know youth labor the
 
05:03:29.390 --> 05:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
hours in the school and everything was
 
05:03:31.128 --> 05:03:31.138 align:start position:0%
working pretty well and someone decided
 
05:03:33.050 --> 05:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
well why don't we fix it
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
and so they complicated things but let's
 
05:03:38.208 --> 05:03:38.218 align:start position:0%
see if we can get people to work one
 
05:03:40.128 --> 05:03:40.138 align:start position:0%
more a day maybe if they have a this is
 
05:03:41.510 --> 05:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
a teacher's conference at the school
 
05:03:43.368 --> 05:03:43.378 align:start position:0%
they have a four day week maybe they
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
have a three day because they work more
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
hours if they have a three-day week well
 
05:03:48.350 --> 05:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
if there's a snow day they could work
 
05:03:51.170 --> 05:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's just made a mess and
 
05:03:54.230 --> 05:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
the hospitality industry uh came to ruin
 
05:03:56.208 --> 05:03:56.218 align:start position:0%
the day that that passed because it was
 
05:03:58.010 --> 05:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
just not workable
 
05:04:00.590 --> 05:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
so that was a mistake
 
05:04:04.128 --> 05:04:04.138 align:start position:0%
we put that behind us uh last term
 
05:04:06.890 --> 05:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
and yet another mistake crept in
 
05:04:06.900 --> 05:04:08.570 align:start position:0%
and yet another mistake crept in
because

05:04:08.570 --> 05:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:04:10.850 --> 05:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
although we expanded the number of hours
 
05:04:15.288 --> 05:04:15.298 align:start position:0%
but a kid could work from 30 to 35 some
 
05:04:18.050 --> 05:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
misgivings about that we got rid of
 
05:04:19.788 --> 05:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
night work all together
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
and there was a problem with the you
 
05:04:24.770 --> 05:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
know the language that remains where if
 
05:04:29.208 --> 05:04:29.218 align:start position:0%
a person uh works less than uh or is in
 
05:04:30.590 --> 05:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
school less than five days they could
 
05:04:33.410 --> 05:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
work 48 hours and I know that was not
 
05:04:34.970 --> 05:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
intended but
 
05:04:36.530 --> 05:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
unintentional things creep into
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
legislation and so what I tried to do
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
and I tried really hard last year to
 
05:04:43.070 --> 05:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
come up with a really good language for
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that we were doing before we
 
05:04:49.128 --> 05:04:49.138 align:start position:0%
did that uh Grievous ERA last year and
 
05:04:52.910 --> 05:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's what is in 125.
 
05:04:55.550 --> 05:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
um so we Define the the school year as
 
05:04:57.288 --> 05:04:57.298 align:start position:0%
between the date on which the school
 
05:04:59.750 --> 05:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
year begins and the date the school year
 
05:04:59.760 --> 05:05:01.128 align:start position:0%
year begins and the date the school year
ends

05:05:01.128 --> 05:05:01.138 align:start position:0%
ends
 
05:05:03.590 --> 05:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
what could be simpler than that and we
 
05:05:05.390 --> 05:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
know the department understands that if
 
05:05:08.090 --> 05:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
the student lives in this school
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
district that's the calendar they go by
 
05:05:11.448 --> 05:05:11.458 align:start position:0%
and if they live in another school
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
districts they go you know the employer
 
05:05:14.750 --> 05:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
knows that you know that's the it's
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward I think it's
 
05:05:19.250 --> 05:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
much more consistent than the days that
 
05:05:20.750 --> 05:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
they might have off that was in that
 
05:05:24.530 --> 05:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:28.190 --> 05:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
um so so they cannot work more than 35
 
05:05:28.200 --> 05:05:30.050 align:start position:0%
um so so they cannot work more than 35
hours

05:05:30.050 --> 05:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:05:32.150 --> 05:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
in a week other than the school's
 
05:05:34.368 --> 05:05:34.378 align:start position:0%
vacation week again pretty closely
 
05:05:37.128 --> 05:05:37.138 align:start position:0%
defined and not hard to find out when
 
05:05:38.270 --> 05:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
that is
 
05:05:45.410 --> 05:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:48.590 --> 05:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
Roman 7
 
05:05:52.010 --> 05:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
where summer vacation is the date on
 
05:05:54.110 --> 05:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
which the school year ends and the date
 
05:05:56.448 --> 05:05:56.458 align:start position:0%
on which It Begins for the following
 
05:05:56.458 --> 05:05:57.288 align:start position:0%
on which It Begins for the following
year

05:05:57.288 --> 05:05:57.298 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:05:59.270 --> 05:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
not hard to understand so we know when
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
summer vacation is
 
05:06:03.110 --> 05:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
and that you know they could work 48
 
05:06:03.120 --> 05:06:05.390 align:start position:0%
and that you know they could work 48
hours

05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:06:06.948 --> 05:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
05:06:09.230 --> 05:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
we think that's fine it shouldn't
 
05:06:11.410 --> 05:06:11.420 align:start position:0%
interfere with their education
 
05:06:15.170 --> 05:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
but then what down in the section two we
 
05:06:17.750 --> 05:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
get down to we put down youth employment
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
law and night work we put this back
 
05:06:23.208 --> 05:06:23.218 align:start position:0%
and we're asking that the the youth
 
05:06:24.708 --> 05:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
shall not be permitted to work later
 
05:06:26.330 --> 05:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
than 9 pm
 
05:06:29.330 --> 05:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
on Sunday through Thursday which we know
 
05:06:31.430 --> 05:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
are generally assumed to be school
 
05:06:33.948 --> 05:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
nights we used to call them school
 
05:06:33.958 --> 05:06:36.050 align:start position:0%
nights we used to call them school
nights

05:06:36.050 --> 05:06:36.060 align:start position:0%
nights
 
05:06:38.448 --> 05:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
um but they could work
 
05:06:41.330 --> 05:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
until 12 am
 
05:06:43.368 --> 05:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
on Friday and Saturday which we know are
 
05:06:45.770 --> 05:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
the busy times and restaurants where
 
05:06:47.448 --> 05:06:47.458 align:start position:0%
these kids would be their services
 
05:06:51.230 --> 05:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
needed and that's the scope of the bill
 
05:06:53.208 --> 05:06:53.218 align:start position:0%
that's that's all it does it tries to
 
05:06:56.090 --> 05:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
fix the error that crept in last time
 
05:06:57.708 --> 05:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
and we certainly don't want to go back
 
05:06:57.718 --> 05:06:58.550 align:start position:0%
and we certainly don't want to go back
to

05:06:58.550 --> 05:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:07:02.090 --> 05:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
the 1f Playland 2fyc approach that we
 
05:07:04.128 --> 05:07:04.138 align:start position:0%
had from that time so that's that is
 
05:07:05.690 --> 05:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
what I've offered today
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
and I I know that there are still
 
05:07:09.350 --> 05:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
05:07:11.810 --> 05:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
you know with people adhering to the
 
05:07:13.670 --> 05:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
laws that we have it doesn't mean that
 
05:07:15.708 --> 05:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
we should get rid of all laws and give
 
05:07:17.930 --> 05:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
up trying uh there are certainly
 
05:07:19.730 --> 05:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
incidents I have a few here from the
 
05:07:23.930 --> 05:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
usdol uh where people you know had
 
05:07:25.730 --> 05:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
even younger workers that they govern
 
05:07:28.610 --> 05:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
you know working too many hours doing
 
05:07:30.530 --> 05:07:30.540 align:start position:0%
things that they should not be doing I'm
 
05:07:32.448 --> 05:07:32.458 align:start position:0%
not going to name names not productive
 
05:07:35.330 --> 05:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
but so we need to be we need to be
 
05:07:38.090 --> 05:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
monitoring these things and we need to
 
05:07:41.150 --> 05:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
have regulations that make sense for our
 
05:07:41.160 --> 05:07:42.230 align:start position:0%
have regulations that make sense for our
communities

05:07:42.230 --> 05:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:07:45.410 --> 05:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions
 
05:07:46.910 --> 05:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
05:07:55.610 --> 05:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:57.410 --> 05:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
05:07:59.090 --> 05:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
05:08:01.550 --> 05:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call Mike Summers New
 
05:08:07.368 --> 05:08:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
05:08:12.170 --> 05:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
Mike Summers I'm the president CEO of
 
05:08:13.250 --> 05:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
05:08:13.260 --> 05:08:15.170 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
Association

05:08:15.170 --> 05:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
Association
 
05:08:15.180 --> 05:08:16.670 align:start position:0%
Association
um

05:08:16.670 --> 05:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:18.890 --> 05:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
we're not really supportive of this bill
 
05:08:21.470 --> 05:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily but uh representative Cahill
 
05:08:22.850 --> 05:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
is correct it was a little bit of a
 
05:08:24.708 --> 05:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
glitch in the language that passed last
 
05:08:26.810 --> 05:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
year so
 
05:08:29.090 --> 05:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
um what he's referring to is last year
 
05:08:31.128 --> 05:08:31.138 align:start position:0%
there was a threshold put in that 16 and
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
17 year olds who worked no more than 35
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
hours during a school week sounds
 
05:08:37.070 --> 05:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine that worked great for the
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
industry simple to manage easy to to
 
05:08:39.360 --> 05:08:40.730 align:start position:0%
industry simple to manage easy to to
maintain

05:08:40.730 --> 05:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
05:08:42.410 --> 05:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
what we didn't realize in the way that
 
05:08:44.448 --> 05:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
language was drafted is that it
 
05:08:46.550 --> 05:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
essentially also because it said
 
05:08:48.650 --> 05:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
something the effect of whenever they're
 
05:08:50.868 --> 05:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
in school for five days it then allowed
 
05:08:52.970 --> 05:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
it in a long weekend week so they were
 
05:08:54.650 --> 05:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
in school four days they could
 
05:08:56.930 --> 05:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
ultimately work 48 hours and that really
 
05:08:58.490 --> 05:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
was not the intent I think of last
 
05:09:00.770 --> 05:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
year's legislation and frankly if we
 
05:09:02.930 --> 05:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
were to correct that uh that little
 
05:09:04.610 --> 05:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
technicality I think we would be fine
 
05:09:08.030 --> 05:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
with that we're really not too concerned
 
05:09:09.530 --> 05:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
with the way representative Cahill has
 
05:09:11.150 --> 05:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
put in you know beginning of the school
 
05:09:12.910 --> 05:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
year end of the school year that's fine
 
05:09:16.310 --> 05:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
in past years the Labor Day thing really
 
05:09:18.770 --> 05:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
wasn't very easy to manage and it really
 
05:09:20.448 --> 05:09:20.458 align:start position:0%
didn't align frankly with a lot of
 
05:09:22.670 --> 05:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
school year actual calendars so we're
 
05:09:24.410 --> 05:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
pretty comfortable with that the only
 
05:09:26.208 --> 05:09:26.218 align:start position:0%
thing we're opposed to is bringing in
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
the night work hour restrictions where
 
05:09:30.410 --> 05:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
you have nine o'clock and midnight and
 
05:09:31.970 --> 05:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
really the reason for that is it's just
 
05:09:33.890 --> 05:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
one more thing for businesses to manage
 
05:09:36.650 --> 05:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis whereas if the 35 hour
 
05:09:38.930 --> 05:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
a week threshold is maintained that's
 
05:09:40.430 --> 05:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
much simpler to manage if we have an
 
05:09:42.530 --> 05:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
employee that forgets to clock out by a
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
minute so they clocked out at 901 or
 
05:09:46.670 --> 05:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
something that's a violation whereas if
 
05:09:49.128 --> 05:09:49.138 align:start position:0%
they clock out at 901 over the course of
 
05:09:50.810 --> 05:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
the week we can manage it to its own
 
05:09:54.288 --> 05:09:54.298 align:start position:0%
it's no more than 35 hours so I didn't
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
really put down we were supportive or
 
05:09:57.708 --> 05:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
opposed to but we certainly are
 
05:09:59.810 --> 05:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
concerned with the night work provision
 
05:10:02.270 --> 05:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
being added but there is a technical
 
05:10:03.890 --> 05:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
correction that representative Cahill
 
05:10:05.570 --> 05:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
offers in this bill that we are actually
 
05:10:07.610 --> 05:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
fine with and supportive of
 
05:10:09.530 --> 05:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll end and happy to
 
05:10:14.810 --> 05:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:16.670 --> 05:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
um so did I understand you correctly
 
05:10:20.090 --> 05:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
that you would rather the child be
 
05:10:22.550 --> 05:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for their hours on a school
 
05:10:22.560 --> 05:10:23.810 align:start position:0%
responsible for their hours on a school
night

05:10:23.810 --> 05:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
night
 
05:10:27.770 --> 05:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh and not their adult bosses did I hear
 
05:10:30.288 --> 05:10:30.298 align:start position:0%
that correctly no I don't know because I
 
05:10:33.350 --> 05:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
thought you said you wanted did you say
 
05:10:36.590 --> 05:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
that you wanted the employer not to be
 
05:10:38.510 --> 05:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for when their employee
 
05:10:40.150 --> 05:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
clocks out
 
05:10:42.830 --> 05:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
no I'm suggesting that teenagers are
 
05:10:44.510 --> 05:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
hard to um
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
how to both see this delicately trained
 
05:10:49.490 --> 05:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
to certain uh habits so uh you know
 
05:10:51.050 --> 05:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
having them clock out in a timely
 
05:10:52.970 --> 05:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
fashion uh is never anything you can
 
05:10:55.730 --> 05:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
rely on so it's something that you know
 
05:10:57.948 --> 05:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
again we have a 35-hour threshold the 35
 
05:11:00.050 --> 05:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
hour threshold is easier to manage easy
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
to work with and leads to less
 
05:11:01.798 --> 05:11:07.250 align:start position:0%
to work with and leads to less
violations

05:11:07.250 --> 05:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:08.990 --> 05:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
05:11:11.330 --> 05:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
thank you I think I heard you say you
 
05:11:13.850 --> 05:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
had some concern
 
05:11:16.610 --> 05:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
um with the fact that the 35 hours as is
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
in the law today only applies to a full
 
05:11:21.470 --> 05:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
school week to a five-day school that's
 
05:11:25.730 --> 05:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
correct and but
 
05:11:28.490 --> 05:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
don't the members of your organization
 
05:11:31.868 --> 05:11:31.878 align:start position:0%
the employers have the ability to
 
05:11:35.150 --> 05:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
work with that as they see fit that if
 
05:11:38.090 --> 05:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
it's a three-day week they wouldn't
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to raise the hours up
 
05:11:43.850 --> 05:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
to the full 48 but they could use their
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
discretion as to how much over the 35
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
they could go correct that is true
 
05:11:51.170 --> 05:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
absolutely true
 
05:11:53.810 --> 05:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
um but I also recognize that 48 hours
 
05:11:56.570 --> 05:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
for a teenager to be working which I'm
 
05:11:58.550 --> 05:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
not saying all employees were not saying
 
05:12:00.170 --> 05:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
that any employees would do it but it
 
05:12:02.570 --> 05:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
could potentially happen and the 35
 
05:12:04.730 --> 05:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
hours was kind of negotiated out and
 
05:12:06.410 --> 05:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
discussed last year we were perfectly
 
05:12:07.850 --> 05:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
comfortable with 35 hours that's
 
05:12:10.910 --> 05:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
perfectly reasonable but I think 30 if
 
05:12:13.730 --> 05:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
48 hours is in the current
 
05:12:15.470 --> 05:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the statute if 48
 
05:12:18.230 --> 05:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
Hours was allowed I don't know I don't
 
05:12:19.730 --> 05:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
know that that's really necessary during
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
a shortened school week they're in
 
05:12:23.090 --> 05:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
school they got homework they get other
 
05:12:26.208 --> 05:12:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:30.410 --> 05:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:32.090 --> 05:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
I know you let him off up you know
 
05:12:34.730 --> 05:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvester
 
05:12:37.128 --> 05:12:37.138 align:start position:0%
just want to ask if the person is up to
 
05:12:39.530 --> 05:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
the 35 hours and then they clock out at
 
05:12:41.570 --> 05:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
the 901 what happens or maybe I'll
 
05:12:43.430 --> 05:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding it's a violation it
 
05:12:45.050 --> 05:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
does because essentially it's 35 hours
 
05:12:48.110 --> 05:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
in a minute okay thank you
 
05:12:50.330 --> 05:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
but I think my point in testimony is
 
05:12:52.010 --> 05:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
that I only have to manage that one day
 
05:12:54.288 --> 05:12:54.298 align:start position:0%
of the week instead of all five six days
 
05:13:00.110 --> 05:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:01.730 --> 05:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
all right I've seen your other questions
 
05:13:05.090 --> 05:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Summers thank you
 
05:13:07.610 --> 05:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
I have no other pink cards
 
05:13:09.490 --> 05:13:09.500 align:start position:0%
and I have two lobbyists with orange
 
05:13:12.410 --> 05:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
badges that are just I know they want to
 
05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:19.850 --> 05:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
no I it's your choice I
 
05:13:23.150 --> 05:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
speak or speakers what is it what's the
 
05:13:23.160 --> 05:13:26.628 align:start position:0%
speak or speakers what is it what's the
exactly

05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:26.638 --> 05:13:28.368 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:13:28.368 --> 05:13:28.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:34.490 --> 05:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'll fill out
 
05:13:36.288 --> 05:13:36.298 align:start position:0%
a pink card afterwards
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
um for your record my name is Bruce
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
Berkey and I'm here representing the
 
05:13:42.110 --> 05:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
national Federation of Independent
 
05:13:45.650 --> 05:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
Business as well as ski New Hampshire
 
05:13:50.868 --> 05:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
um both uh uh business groups employ uh
 
05:13:52.850 --> 05:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
High School age kids
 
05:13:56.810 --> 05:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
and as I listened to Mr Summers
 
05:13:56.820 --> 05:13:58.490 align:start position:0%
and as I listened to Mr Summers
testimony

05:13:58.490 --> 05:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:14:03.470 --> 05:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
it struck me that even if a
 
05:14:07.310 --> 05:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
a 16 or 17 year old was only working say
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
10 hours a week
 
05:14:12.590 --> 05:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
and they clocked out at 901. there would
 
05:14:14.270 --> 05:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
be a violation
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's important for that
 
05:14:19.610 --> 05:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the event that that 16
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
year old isn't quite as
 
05:14:27.530 --> 05:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh attendant to the hour as perhaps as
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
or her boss might be and in most cases
 
05:14:34.010 --> 05:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:37.010 --> 05:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
but I I think that having that that
 
05:14:39.770 --> 05:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
degree of flexibility and not a sharp
 
05:14:43.490 --> 05:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock hour is important in how
 
05:14:47.570 --> 05:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
this law is uh uh implemented and and
 
05:14:49.730 --> 05:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
and and governed
 
05:14:52.250 --> 05:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
would that I'll conclude my testimony
 
05:14:54.350 --> 05:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk no question
 
05:14:56.930 --> 05:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
similar question as before so it sounds
 
05:14:59.270 --> 05:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
like then you're okay with the cap at
 
05:15:03.050 --> 05:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
the time in general in theory it's just
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
about are you saying it the concern
 
05:15:07.310 --> 05:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
really is about
 
05:15:09.948 --> 05:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
needing some flexibility
 
05:15:13.010 --> 05:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
if it's a few minutes after nine but the
 
05:15:15.110 --> 05:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
basic cap of time on a school night for
 
05:15:17.930 --> 05:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
example is something
 
05:15:20.208 --> 05:15:20.218 align:start position:0%
um the employers you represent would
 
05:15:22.550 --> 05:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
probably want to have happen for the
 
05:15:24.770 --> 05:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
kids that work for them
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
that that's a fair assessment of a
 
05:15:29.628 --> 05:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz and because you
 
05:15:32.708 --> 05:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
know by having that hard
 
05:15:37.250 --> 05:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
cut off time of nine nine pm
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
um you know if it hap if the person
 
05:15:42.830 --> 05:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
happens to clock out at 902 you you lose
 
05:15:45.350 --> 05:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
that flexibility and and the person who
 
05:15:47.448 --> 05:15:47.458 align:start position:0%
clocks out at 902 is you know could be
 
05:15:48.830 --> 05:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
well with a
 
05:15:53.628 --> 05:15:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:56.570 --> 05:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
05:15:59.990 --> 05:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think how to address your
 
05:16:00.000 --> 05:16:02.208 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think how to address your
concern

05:16:02.208 --> 05:16:02.218 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:16:04.670 --> 05:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
um what
 
05:16:07.910 --> 05:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're you're referring to a hard time
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
of nine o'clock being a problem
 
05:16:13.128 --> 05:16:13.138 align:start position:0%
how does one enter into legislation a
 
05:16:15.650 --> 05:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
softer time
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
but by not having that that nine o'clock
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
hour so basically take any limit off a
 
05:16:23.810 --> 05:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
kid can work till midnight on a school
 
05:16:23.820 --> 05:16:24.770 align:start position:0%
kid can work till midnight on a school
night

05:16:24.770 --> 05:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
night
 
05:16:28.430 --> 05:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
well I I think nine o'clock is not in
 
05:16:34.368 --> 05:16:34.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:36.650 --> 05:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
but basically you're saying that a kid
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
ought to be allowed to work until
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
midnight on a school night
 
05:16:43.490 --> 05:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:50.810 --> 05:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:53.510 --> 05:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so what is the penalty if
 
05:16:55.190 --> 05:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
you're in violation of the nine o'clock
 
05:16:58.310 --> 05:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
or whatever time or the 35 hours or I I
 
05:17:00.350 --> 05:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
do not know specifically
 
05:17:02.990 --> 05:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh I know there is one I know there's a
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
process at the Department of Labor but I
 
05:17:06.590 --> 05:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
don't know specifically I believe it
 
05:17:11.510 --> 05:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
could be as much as 250 over incident
 
05:17:14.990 --> 05:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
can I follow up follow up do you know if
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
um the violations are I mean the DOL
 
05:17:20.448 --> 05:17:20.458 align:start position:0%
like um Deputy Commissioner earlier said
 
05:17:22.610 --> 05:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
that he works with companies he works
 
05:17:24.288 --> 05:17:24.298 align:start position:0%
with people to let them know he'd rather
 
05:17:27.830 --> 05:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
fix the problem than then and then uh as
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
05:17:32.090 --> 05:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
applying penalties or fees or whatever
 
05:17:33.770 --> 05:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
how often does it happen
 
05:17:35.330 --> 05:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
that you have to pay a fine or someone
 
05:17:36.948 --> 05:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
has to pay a fine
 
05:17:39.948 --> 05:17:39.958 align:start position:0%
I I would uh defer to the department I
 
05:17:41.930 --> 05:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
don't know if Rudy is here no I don't
 
05:17:41.940 --> 05:17:43.430 align:start position:0%
don't know if Rudy is here no I don't
okay

05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:17:45.650 --> 05:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
um I will say that this department is
 
05:17:48.890 --> 05:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
very good to work with and and they are
 
05:17:50.770 --> 05:17:50.780 align:start position:0%
um you know more about educating
 
05:17:54.288 --> 05:17:54.298 align:start position:0%
employers and and employees through the
 
05:17:56.230 --> 05:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
process but that if there are
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
recidivists out there
 
05:18:00.890 --> 05:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
um they will take action and and what
 
05:18:05.090 --> 05:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:09.530 --> 05:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I think I would also like to
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
give Mr Summers a chance to answer this
 
05:18:16.070 --> 05:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
if he wants to
 
05:18:16.080 --> 05:18:17.510 align:start position:0%
if he wants to
um

05:18:17.510 --> 05:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:19.490 --> 05:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
oftentimes schools will have a
 
05:18:21.430 --> 05:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
requirement or even
 
05:18:24.830 --> 05:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
non-school connected sports leagues will
 
05:18:27.288 --> 05:18:27.298 align:start position:0%
have a grade requirement
 
05:18:30.650 --> 05:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
would would you on behalf of the kids be
 
05:18:34.850 --> 05:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
willing to attach a minimum grade
 
05:18:34.860 --> 05:18:36.350 align:start position:0%
willing to attach a minimum grade
average

05:18:36.350 --> 05:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
average
 
05:18:39.288 --> 05:18:39.298 align:start position:0%
if they're working till midnight on a
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
school night could we track their grades
 
05:18:44.570 --> 05:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:46.730 --> 05:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
is that aimed
 
05:18:48.948 --> 05:18:48.958 align:start position:0%
at the farthest okay
 
05:18:48.958 --> 05:18:50.090 align:start position:0%
at the farthest okay
um

05:18:50.090 --> 05:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:54.170 --> 05:18:54.180 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd be a little hesitant uh for
 
05:18:56.868 --> 05:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
um any number of reasons privacy
 
05:18:58.910 --> 05:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
concerns between the employer and the
 
05:18:58.920 --> 05:19:00.650 align:start position:0%
concerns between the employer and the
employee

05:19:00.650 --> 05:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
employee
 
05:19:00.660 --> 05:19:01.368 align:start position:0%
employee
um

05:19:01.368 --> 05:19:01.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:03.770 --> 05:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
additional administrative work for the
 
05:19:03.780 --> 05:19:05.810 align:start position:0%
additional administrative work for the
employer

05:19:05.810 --> 05:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
employer
 
05:19:05.820 --> 05:19:06.590 align:start position:0%
employer
um

05:19:06.590 --> 05:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:08.690 --> 05:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's maintaining those
 
05:19:12.530 --> 05:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
records tracking down those records
 
05:19:15.288 --> 05:19:15.298 align:start position:0%
um I I think that that could be somewhat
 
05:19:15.298 --> 05:19:17.990 align:start position:0%
um I I think that that could be somewhat
burdensome

05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:20.690 --> 05:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
was Adam Holcomb
 
05:19:23.330 --> 05:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me the question
 
05:19:24.830 --> 05:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about a lot of
 
05:19:27.650 --> 05:19:27.660 align:start position:0%
school-aged kids is this bill restricted
 
05:19:29.330 --> 05:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
to just kids who are going to a public
 
05:19:31.730 --> 05:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
school which would have a typical eight
 
05:19:33.890 --> 05:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
to three what about the children who are
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
homeschooled maybe can be homeschooled
 
05:19:38.390 --> 05:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
at different hours to accommodate their
 
05:19:41.090 --> 05:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
parents schedule would this allow them
 
05:19:42.770 --> 05:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
to be able to go and work at different
 
05:19:46.010 --> 05:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
times it is my understanding that this
 
05:19:48.230 --> 05:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
would apply to every 16 and 17 year old
 
05:19:50.810 --> 05:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
whether they're in a public high school
 
05:19:54.170 --> 05:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
a private high school homeschooled
 
05:19:57.530 --> 05:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
um but I that's my understanding
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:03.830 --> 05:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Burkey thank you
 
05:20:18.850 --> 05:20:18.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:21.948 --> 05:20:21.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm ready to go
 
05:20:24.350 --> 05:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's fine okay we'll do that after I
 
05:20:25.910 --> 05:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:20:27.830 --> 05:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
giving me a chance to answer some
 
05:20:30.230 --> 05:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
questions hopefully uh my name is Tracy
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
McGraw I'm one of the attorneys at the
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Labor
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
um there were I think two or three
 
05:20:37.850 --> 05:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
questions that were being asked about
 
05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor so I'll start
 
05:20:42.050 --> 05:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
with the one that I actually remember
 
05:20:43.610 --> 05:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
um for the penalty for something like
 
05:20:46.990 --> 05:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
this it would be under Section 273 11a
 
05:20:50.930 --> 05:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
the only penalties underneath youth uh
 
05:20:53.390 --> 05:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
employment law are for criminal
 
05:20:56.090 --> 05:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
penalties misdemeanor and felony so we
 
05:20:59.090 --> 05:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
would be looking at civil penalties and
 
05:21:00.610 --> 05:21:00.620 align:start position:0%
according to
 
05:21:04.550 --> 05:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
27311a the Civil penalty is up to 2500
 
05:21:07.190 --> 05:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
per violation
 
05:21:09.350 --> 05:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
so in a case like that if it was
 
05:21:12.708 --> 05:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
determined that clocking out at 901 was
 
05:21:14.448 --> 05:21:14.458 align:start position:0%
a violation based upon whatever the
 
05:21:16.430 --> 05:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
final language is of the bill if there
 
05:21:17.690 --> 05:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
is any change
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
then that would be a violation of up to
 
05:21:24.708 --> 05:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
2500 but as has been noted before we
 
05:21:26.208 --> 05:21:26.218 align:start position:0%
tend to try to work with employers
 
05:21:28.610 --> 05:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
especially if there's a situation that
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
pops up somebody forgot to clock out
 
05:21:32.628 --> 05:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
somebody clocked out at 901 we would
 
05:21:34.850 --> 05:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
probably try to work with them try to
 
05:21:37.490 --> 05:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
remediate the problem with them and go
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
from there so the penalty would start
 
05:21:40.490 --> 05:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
out lower
 
05:21:43.010 --> 05:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
and I don't recall the other question so
 
05:21:50.810 --> 05:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:52.730 --> 05:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
first one was the fine
 
05:21:54.708 --> 05:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
then you asked a second
 
05:21:54.718 --> 05:21:58.730 align:start position:0%
then you asked a second
oh

05:21:58.730 --> 05:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:00.948 --> 05:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you how often do you actually
 
05:22:03.530 --> 05:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
impose the fines
 
05:22:07.190 --> 05:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
as far as having to do with youth law
 
05:22:09.530 --> 05:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I can't give you a number as to how
 
05:22:11.570 --> 05:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
often specifically but it does seem to
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
show up an awful lot when we're doing
 
05:22:16.190 --> 05:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
inspections as there's an issue with
 
05:22:18.708 --> 05:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
youth law most of the time when we do
 
05:22:20.868 --> 05:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
have fines for youth law it comes down
 
05:22:23.868 --> 05:22:23.878 align:start position:0%
to the documentation that's required for
 
05:22:26.690 --> 05:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
an under 18 to be able to work that they
 
05:22:29.230 --> 05:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
don't have that proper documentation
 
05:22:31.730 --> 05:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
I've been at the Department of Labor as
 
05:22:33.350 --> 05:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
an attorney for three months but I've
 
05:22:36.410 --> 05:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
been doing this for 22 years and I can
 
05:22:39.410 --> 05:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
say that I have never seen an issue with
 
05:22:42.850 --> 05:22:42.860 align:start position:0%
respect to time frames being a violation
 
05:22:45.530 --> 05:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it's that much but
 
05:22:47.330 --> 05:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
that's the best answer I could give you
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:22:50.810 --> 05:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
no I appreciate it and can I follow up
 
05:22:52.010 --> 05:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
real quick
 
05:22:52.020 --> 05:22:52.730 align:start position:0%
real quick
um

05:22:52.730 --> 05:22:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:54.770 --> 05:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
so say this law did come into effect
 
05:22:56.570 --> 05:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be
 
05:22:58.610 --> 05:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
um smarter for the
 
05:23:01.190 --> 05:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
the employers at least they say Okay
 
05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
punch out at 8 45 your shift goes from
 
05:23:06.050 --> 05:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
five to eight forty five not five to
 
05:23:08.448 --> 05:23:08.458 align:start position:0%
nine so that you can make sure that
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
within that 15 minutes they get that
 
05:23:12.050 --> 05:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
punch and punch out and get out of there
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know would it just seems like if it
 
05:23:15.350 --> 05:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
was there they would at least prepare
 
05:23:16.430 --> 05:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
for it
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
I have to admit while I was sitting
 
05:23:19.610 --> 05:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
there that was one of the things I was
 
05:23:21.650 --> 05:23:21.660 align:start position:0%
thinking about your clock out time is 8
 
05:23:24.530 --> 05:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
45 and at least that gives you a 15
 
05:23:26.690 --> 05:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
minute buffer but I think no matter what
 
05:23:28.368 --> 05:23:28.378 align:start position:0%
time you put you're still running the
 
05:23:32.208 --> 05:23:32.218 align:start position:0%
risk of someone who is not learned a
 
05:23:34.128 --> 05:23:34.138 align:start position:0%
full sense of responsibility yet to make
 
05:23:35.810 --> 05:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
sure that they clock out in a timely
 
05:23:38.750 --> 05:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
manner to avoid a penalty for the
 
05:23:38.760 --> 05:23:41.030 align:start position:0%
manner to avoid a penalty for the
employer

05:23:41.030 --> 05:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
employer
 
05:23:42.530 --> 05:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:45.890 --> 05:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative colcom followed by vermic
 
05:23:47.270 --> 05:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:48.250 --> 05:23:48.260 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry
 
05:23:51.470 --> 05:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
so as an attorney with the Department of
 
05:23:51.480 --> 05:23:52.310 align:start position:0%
so as an attorney with the Department of
Labor

05:23:52.310 --> 05:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
Labor
 
05:23:54.890 --> 05:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
let's say you were at a store
 
05:23:58.368 --> 05:23:58.378 align:start position:0%
and um you were being helped by a child
 
05:24:01.610 --> 05:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
who is a youth school-aged child who's
 
05:24:01.620 --> 05:24:02.570 align:start position:0%
who is a youth school-aged child who's
working

05:24:02.570 --> 05:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
working
 
05:24:04.788 --> 05:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
and he is trying to help you problem
 
05:24:07.010 --> 05:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
solve and in the middle of this and
 
05:24:09.050 --> 05:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
leaving you hanging he says oh time for
 
05:24:11.990 --> 05:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
me to punch out you're on your own see
 
05:24:12.000 --> 05:24:13.010 align:start position:0%
me to punch out you're on your own see
ya

05:24:13.010 --> 05:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
ya
 
05:24:15.170 --> 05:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
um how do you handle that because you
 
05:24:16.850 --> 05:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
would want to I would think because I
 
05:24:19.368 --> 05:24:19.378 align:start position:0%
know I would want to see him or her help
 
05:24:22.070 --> 05:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
me through the situation and focus on
 
05:24:24.410 --> 05:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
the customer service to maintain the
 
05:24:26.510 --> 05:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
customers in that business
 
05:24:30.170 --> 05:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
um and maybe not have a penalty for
 
05:24:32.150 --> 05:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
providing good customer service
 
05:24:34.010 --> 05:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
your thoughts
 
05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
first of all I probably would chuckle a
 
05:24:38.810 --> 05:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
little bit given that I was the cause of
 
05:24:41.090 --> 05:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
this person possibly clocking out after
 
05:24:43.070 --> 05:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock
 
05:24:44.570 --> 05:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
um and then I would probably feel the
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
need to tell my supervisor that I may
 
05:24:49.250 --> 05:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
have caused an issue
 
05:24:52.250 --> 05:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
um my sense of responsibility in that
 
05:24:54.170 --> 05:24:54.180 align:start position:0%
case would be
 
05:24:57.050 --> 05:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
to probably mention to the young man oh
 
05:24:58.850 --> 05:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
I know it's probably or the young woman
 
05:25:01.010 --> 05:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
oh it's probably time for you to go
 
05:25:03.170 --> 05:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
clock out I'm sure you have to be out by
 
05:25:03.180 --> 05:25:04.970 align:start position:0%
clock out I'm sure you have to be out by
nine

05:25:04.970 --> 05:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
nine
 
05:25:06.770 --> 05:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
um and I probably would come into work
 
05:25:09.170 --> 05:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
the next day and talk with my supervisor
 
05:25:10.128 --> 05:25:10.138 align:start position:0%
about it
 
05:25:10.138 --> 05:25:11.930 align:start position:0%
about it
there

05:25:11.930 --> 05:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:25:13.670 --> 05:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
there are other people that will make a
 
05:25:15.050 --> 05:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
decision from that point as to whether
 
05:25:17.930 --> 05:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
or not an inspection is required I don't
 
05:25:20.510 --> 05:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
get to make those decisions but I also
 
05:25:22.070 --> 05:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to walk away from something
 
05:25:24.410 --> 05:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
that I see happening
 
05:25:26.208 --> 05:25:26.218 align:start position:0%
I guess Under the Sea something say
 
05:25:28.250 --> 05:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
something because if it did happen for
 
05:25:29.570 --> 05:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
him it might have happened at another
 
05:25:34.128 --> 05:25:34.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.190 --> 05:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
05:25:38.350 --> 05:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
05:25:40.430 --> 05:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:25:41.810 --> 05:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
taking the question so I'm going to
 
05:25:44.570 --> 05:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
expand a little bit on what my colleague
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh stated in a perfect world
 
05:25:50.510 --> 05:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
every child is going to clock out at
 
05:25:52.010 --> 05:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock
 
05:25:54.288 --> 05:25:54.298 align:start position:0%
I'll use my daughter for an example
 
05:25:56.030 --> 05:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
and I think the last time we heard this
 
05:25:58.430 --> 05:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
bill of Roma Joe's uh
 
05:26:00.948 --> 05:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
owner he was here
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
um and so in that type of business
 
05:26:07.550 --> 05:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
we're at five minutes of nine
 
05:26:09.410 --> 05:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
someone's walking through that door to
 
05:26:10.850 --> 05:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
get that coffee
 
05:26:14.690 --> 05:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
if they happen to clock out at 901 905 I
 
05:26:16.850 --> 05:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
understand that they can actually be
 
05:26:16.860 --> 05:26:18.230 align:start position:0%
understand that they can actually be
penalized

05:26:18.230 --> 05:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
penalized
 
05:26:21.050 --> 05:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
what are the chances that the Department
 
05:26:22.970 --> 05:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
of Labor is going to look at that and
 
05:26:25.730 --> 05:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
say again as people said there needs to
 
05:26:28.250 --> 05:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
be some flexibility
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
um you know 15 minute window
 
05:26:33.170 --> 05:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
I just think in the perfect world nine
 
05:26:34.730 --> 05:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
o'clock would be great
 
05:26:37.368 --> 05:26:37.378 align:start position:0%
uh this isn't a perfect world and I just
 
05:26:38.690 --> 05:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
think that that creates some sort of
 
05:26:40.810 --> 05:26:40.820 align:start position:0%
problem do you agree with that
 
05:26:43.430 --> 05:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
what I think
 
05:26:46.490 --> 05:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
um would work would be if you discussed
 
05:26:47.990 --> 05:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
it among yourselves and determined
 
05:26:51.288 --> 05:26:51.298 align:start position:0%
whether or not to write in something
 
05:26:53.390 --> 05:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
that could help an employer with
 
05:26:56.330 --> 05:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
whatever flexibility may be required we
 
05:26:57.708 --> 05:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
certainly would be able to understand
 
05:27:08.390 --> 05:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:11.150 --> 05:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
I see no other hands no other questions
 
05:27:13.250 --> 05:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for testifying thank
 
05:27:13.260 --> 05:27:14.690 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for testifying thank
you

05:27:14.690 --> 05:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:27:16.430 --> 05:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else I don't have any additional
 
05:27:20.090 --> 05:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:22.190 --> 05:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative baruti thank you Mr
 
05:27:24.350 --> 05:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
05:27:26.868 --> 05:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
I've sat in on a couple of audits for
 
05:27:29.750 --> 05:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
clients that own restaurants and
 
05:27:31.910 --> 05:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
I find the Department of Labor is not
 
05:27:34.610 --> 05:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
looking out for violations like that
 
05:27:37.670 --> 05:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
they might say hey look uh let's watch
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
this or can be careful on this when they
 
05:27:42.530 --> 05:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
go in to do an audit it's usually
 
05:27:44.750 --> 05:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
because of a complaint and they they
 
05:27:46.430 --> 05:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
know what they're looking for
 
05:27:48.650 --> 05:27:48.660 align:start position:0%
they do look at time cards when there's
 
05:27:50.930 --> 05:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
some somebody complains about not
 
05:27:52.850 --> 05:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
getting paid for their time they worked
 
05:27:54.350 --> 05:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
or something and if they find other time
 
05:27:56.090 --> 05:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
cards like that
 
05:27:57.830 --> 05:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
they just tell Leona hey you got to
 
05:27:59.570 --> 05:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
watch this you know they're not out
 
05:28:02.690 --> 05:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
there throw fines at people so I would
 
05:28:06.650 --> 05:28:06.660 align:start position:0%
believe I I the Auditors are I mean I
 
05:28:08.570 --> 05:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
three four different Auditors that I've
 
05:28:10.550 --> 05:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
been with and I think they have the
 
05:28:14.090 --> 05:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
flexibility of saying hey be careful
 
05:28:15.590 --> 05:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:28:18.590 --> 05:28:18.600 align:start position:0%

and then we'll be having a few executive
 
05:29:44.390 --> 05:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
sessions I would like uh in the next two
 
05:29:46.550 --> 05:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
weeks to try to have your subcommittee
 
05:29:49.788 --> 05:29:49.798 align:start position:0%

other than anecdotally the speakers
stated

05:29:56.510 --> 05:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
stated
 
05:30:00.050 --> 05:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
he would like to use every Thursday in
 
05:30:01.788 --> 05:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
February other than the school vacation
 
05:30:04.430 --> 05:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
week for house sessions I'm going to try
 
05:30:06.288 --> 05:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
to get us in on a Thursday because I
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
know that it works best for everybody
 
05:30:10.310 --> 05:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
I have to wait another week or so to
 
05:30:11.930 --> 05:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
find out what's going on but I would
 
05:30:14.810 --> 05:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
like to utilize the first two weeks of
 
05:30:17.868 --> 05:30:17.878 align:start position:0%
this last week of uh
 
05:30:17.878 --> 05:30:22.190 align:start position:0%
this last week of uh
January

05:30:22.190 --> 05:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:23.570 --> 05:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
let's say the first two weeks of
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
February possibly the first three at the
 
05:30:27.288 --> 05:30:27.298 align:start position:0%
most to try to go through their
 
05:30:29.208 --> 05:30:29.218 align:start position:0%
subcommittees it would be great if you
 
05:30:32.090 --> 05:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
could do them in one two-hour meeting on
 
05:30:36.170 --> 05:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
these to provide more detailed debate or
 
05:30:38.990 --> 05:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
whatever with some uh
 
05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
because I didn't hear the debate
 
05:30:43.730 --> 05:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
on but as you know in the committee is
 
05:30:46.368 --> 05:30:46.378 align:start position:0%
very different they ask they present
 
05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
they ask a question we answer and the
 
05:30:49.850 --> 05:30:49.860 align:start position:0%
subcommittee have the ability to bring
 
05:30:51.590 --> 05:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
in people have a more debate amongst
 
05:30:53.390 --> 05:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
yourselves as well as a debate with
 
05:30:55.190 --> 05:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
people that are coming in to have a
 
05:30:57.410 --> 05:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
little more involved conversation it
 
05:30:58.788 --> 05:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
would be great if those committees could
 
05:31:02.448 --> 05:31:02.458 align:start position:0%
do that in the next two weeks or so I
 
05:31:03.410 --> 05:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
will be
 
05:31:05.930 --> 05:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
um they're probably it'd be great if I
 
05:31:07.850 --> 05:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
could have some potential dates from you
 
05:31:09.650 --> 05:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
folks so I could have them in next
 
05:31:10.850 --> 05:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
