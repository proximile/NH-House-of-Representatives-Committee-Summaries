those um subcommittee members our first
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
work session that we'll have it'll start
 
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
in just a moment is for House Bill 608

representative n Nagel kofalt Weber and
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
nut upam um so with that change we don't
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to shuffle out of our
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
chairs representative McKay is joining
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%

00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
to get him a copy if you just give me
 
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
just one more moment to shuffle my
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:09:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
started

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon and welcome to
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
the work session on House Bill
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
608 um this bill was initially
 
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
introduced before any of the changes
 
00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
happened and so what we've been able to
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
see in the meantime is that the
 
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
implementation um has been proceeding
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
but there have been some challenges of
 
00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:18.519 align:start position:0%
the implementation um I think the
 
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
largest question we have here is what
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
the status is how we're moving forward
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
um what oversight is necessary and what
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
support the legislature can provide to
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that if we are an observant
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
part of this process we understand what
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
the actual needs are of the department
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
and of the community so that as if we're
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
able to move forward and keep an eye and
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
work together we can understand if
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's anything that we needs to be
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
introduced next year to make sure that
 
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
this department is able to function in
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
the way that we need it to because quite
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
frankly the this the people that are
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
served by this department are the people
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
that if for to help anybody as a
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
government they they're absolutely who
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
we owee help to because they they're
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
very important people that may not have
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
the cap the ability to do everything
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
that they need to on their own and their
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
parents won't live long enough to take
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
care of them for their entire lives so
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
this is one of the very very very
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
important things we do as a government
 
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that we need to have good
 
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
important care to make sure that is
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
executed as we need and then we also
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
make sure the department is empowered as
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
they need in order order to meet the
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
challenges that we
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
see so um as this is a work session um
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a hearing so it's not the same
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
issue of pink cards but this is a
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
dynamic situation so we want to make
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
sure that we're able to hear from those
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
involved those impacted and that we can
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
understand sort of what's going on now
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
um I do have an amendment that would
 
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
sort of update the language of this to
 
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the actual Amendment
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
back yet but I did provide my requests
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
to um o L and the amendment simply would
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
change the date of when it would start
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
and and instead of just saying the
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall not Implement uh BDS
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
redesign prior to July 21st and to Halt
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
other processes that it would say that
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
the commissioner shall not Implement
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
aspect yes could I ask if would you tell
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
us exactly where on the bill you're
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
changing things yes my
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
apology can line it in thank you there's
 
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
been a few moving pieces and that's why
 
00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
um I was hoping to have the actual draft
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
so this is on page one lines 3 through 7
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
uh Roman
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
1 to change it to read in that first
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
line establish a sequence of pilot
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
projects um and to have the start date
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
be July 1st um although obviously if
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
this is a process that is going to be
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
helpful it says no later than it so this
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
isn't something that requires
 
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
legislative approval so the idea of
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
working through pilot projects um could
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
be could be done even without enacting
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
this and the idea would that be that the
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall not Implement aspects
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the BDS redesign prior to
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that the changes do not
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
threaten the stability of the state
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
Service delivery system as defined by
 
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 171a colon4 or the provision of care
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
to individuals in the system and further
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
that integration of the full system
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
redesign shall be trialed before
 
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.670 align:start position:0%
redesign shall be trialed before
Statewide

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
implementation Madam chair yes I may
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
again yes being a visual can you put
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
your sorry I'm I'm a visual learner
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
rather than an auditory learner which is
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
why I have trouble with the uh did you
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
pass that out I did pass that out I
 
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
think that's sitting under your smaller
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
smaller device it's the one that I
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
printed from my email so it's the one
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
email the other section that we have yes
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
printed email should be in that stuff if
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
not I may have done a bad job of
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
Distributing you may have had got I we
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
go it's under everything thank you I'm
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
sorry I just want to be sure we're all
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
on the same page here oh not problem and
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
having the having the language in front
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
of me is helpful I I appreciate that and
 
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
this may just be a starting point but
 
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of trying to make sure
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
that um everybody is proceeding together
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
towards system
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
success the other section um is on page
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
one line 26 through page two line two
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's simply to take away the interim
 
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
report because uh that time has already
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
passed the idea for an inter interim
 
00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
report that would have been due to days
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
ago is uh
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so that is the general idea
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
that I'm looking towards that it may
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
make sense to continue this in this
 
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
process with the idea of the pilot
 
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
program and move this forward um through
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
the house and through the Senate so that
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
if this does remain necessary by the
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
time the Senate deals with this business
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
that it's available to us without having
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
to come in as a non derain Amendment
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere um and I'm hopeful that we will
 
00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
continue to have good communication
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
between the legislature and the
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
department and everybody involved in
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
this process so that we can make sure
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
that this system is as strong and robust
 
00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:08.670 align:start position:0%
that this system is as strong and robust
as

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
possible and um with that I am actually
 
00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
very thankful to um have Christine
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
santanello I hope I pronounced that
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
correctly I should have asked before um
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%

you very much um for having us here
 
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
today and I did share some information

that I received earliest was emailed out
 
00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
to everybody um I believe the other one
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
went out as well but I have copies for
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
everybody on the committee I just know
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
at the Timeline it would be good to go
 
00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:28.839 align:start position:0%
over it because some of us are visual
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
some of us are auditory and it's good to
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody's on the same page
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
sure so I actually just wanted to
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
basically start um by saying that the um
 
00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:40.759 align:start position:0%
Department I have to put my glasses on
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
sorry um is committed to meeting and
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
collaborating with all stakeholders um
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
to continually improve the developmental
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
disability um Services System for our
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
current and future um participants um we
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
fully understand that change any type of
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
change or organizational change in um
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
Services is hard for everybody um
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
including the department I mean some of
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
these changes were really hard on us as
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
well um and we will continue to support
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
providers during this change um I think
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit here that I just
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify as to what was
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
compliance driven and what is optional
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and really meant to improve the
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
service system because I believe that's
 
00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:27.079 align:start position:0%
really important for us to and some of
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
that is in your information
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
um but I think really what we want to do
 
00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
is um pause on some of the improvements
 
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
while we finish out the changes that
 
00:16:40.189 --> 00:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
were needed for compliance and I think
 
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
that's what everybody um is concerned
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
with um and we support that and I think
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
we really want to improve the system
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
working and listening together with
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
everybody um hearing all thoughts ideas
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
and Views because some different ideas
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
may come up and I believe some new ideas
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
already have come up um so first of all
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
um for compliance that is conflict of
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
interest so that's where a
 
00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:11.799 align:start position:0%
provider cannot be the provider of the
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
direct service and the case management
 
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
um so that is a that was compliance and
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
direct Bill those have been in effect
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
the department was under a corrective
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
action plan in
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
2017 um we had three extensions and we
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
EX costed all of our extensions and
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
Melissa can highlight that if needed um
 
00:17:36.909 --> 00:17:36.919 align:start position:0%
what direct bill means is a huge um
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
shift to the system prior um to July 1st
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
all billing was done through the area
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
agency system and what Medicaid says is
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
each provider of a Medicaid services has
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
to be enrolled independently in Medicaid
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
and have the option to Bill on their own
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
so those were two big shifts to the
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
system the other compliance
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
um area is electronic visit verification
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
known as evv and that has been around
 
00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:12.430 align:start position:0%
known as evv and that has been around
since

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
2016 so those are the compliance things
 
00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
that we have to get done the system
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
Innovation work um includes our
 
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
participant directed and manag services
 
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
that's where individuals and families
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
direct some of their services and we um
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
have a desire and a need to strengthen
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
that for individuals and families and
 
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
also look at the rate for the Financial
 
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
Management Services really
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
differentiating what is a transactional
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
financial um Management Service and what
 
00:18:50.149 --> 00:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
is really the support individuals and
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
families need to do that well the other
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
um change we want to look at and we've
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
engaged with Meyers and sta
 
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
um is our rate work and looking at
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
starting at the cost of the direct
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
support professional and building out
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
rates based on that person so those are
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
the two areas that the department has
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
slated as our next steps um once we
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
finish the change from direct bill um
 
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.990 align:start position:0%
finish the change from direct bill um
and

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
we definitely can push all of that work
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
out there are no strict timelines um we
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
want to work on the rates clearly
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
because that's an issue for Workforce
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
for projecting for our next budget cycle
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
right but and those rates are different
 
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
than the hb2 rate so I just want to make
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
sure people understand that um so we
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
really have the ability and are
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
committed um to engage with stakeholders
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
and hear about needs ideas um and so
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
that to guide our future work
 
00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Weber
 
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:00.919 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair and
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
having had that as a framework if we
 
00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:10.039 align:start position:0%
could turn to the bill and the proposed
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
amendments and I don't know if you have
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
seen the proposed
 
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:15.559 align:start position:0%
amendments are there copies of the
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments that they might be
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
able to look at I'm in one of my stats
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
and I will find where that is okay my my
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
question once you have been provided
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
with a copy and I could perhaps give one
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
to M Dyer to to see um I would just like
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
to know if the bill with the amendment
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
is going to
 
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
foot not with my
 
00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
great can can I I just take a second to
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
look at it sure
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely and my apologies for not
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:33.950 align:start position:0%
 
before

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
in okay ready so I think and I I'd
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
actually like Melissa Hardy question
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah my question really is uh is this
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
language going to create more problems
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
than it solves or is this something that
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
is a decent plan going forward so I
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
think we
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
can we know we can do this without
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
legislation um and and Melissa can talk
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the how we have
 
00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
planned to roll out any of the changes
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
with participant directed Services which
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't even set a date for so that's
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
in the future but for the rate work um
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
what we really wanted to do is some
 
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
testing in with a couple of providers
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
and a couple of services to really flush
 
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
out is this working is it helping and so
 
00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:27.799 align:start position:0%
we have that already as part of our work
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
and I think that because we report
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
quarterly I believe to HHS oversight
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
committee that's a place where we could
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
provide updates but I'd like Melissa to
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
jump in thank you I think as Chris said
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
I think you know in in speaking with our
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and with our area agencies
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
and providers um I think we can come to
 
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
a place where we can work together as a
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
collaborative system um to again pause
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
any sort of system Innovation work we're
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
looking to do not looking um at um the
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
past work that's been done and that
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
we're still doing as far as compliance
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
but I feel like as a system we can come
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
together and operate and and and really
 
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:16.039 align:start position:0%
develop what we need without having it
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
being legislated um just as
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
professionals as individuals um and as
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
provider agency so having just seen this
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
like it's hard to give you a gut
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
reaction on how that would impact that
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
work but in having these conversations
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
ongoing with area agencies and providers
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
I think as a system we should be able to
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
come up with a system collaboratively
 
00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:38.750 align:start position:0%
come up with a system collaboratively
without

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.470 align:start position:0%
without
legislation

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
follow okay so so my concern is this um
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
at the last hearing uh we and and at the
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
initial hearings um we heard very loudly
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
from a number of people who felt that
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't happening which is why there's
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
leg legislation proposed in the first
 
00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:04.039 align:start position:0%
place uh so that's issue number one and
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
and then more specifically what we heard
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
at the last hearing was the issue of
 
00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
agencies that uh because there have been
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
any number of different sorts of
 
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.310 align:start position:0%
any number of different sorts of
creative

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
creative
 
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement schemes are now
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
theoretically owing back
 
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
more then I mean they're really under
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
Financial strain of the sort which may
 
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
result in the loss of service providers
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
and uh that is a matter of extreme
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
concern to all of us and so I guess what
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear as a little bit of an
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
update is how that is being
 
00:24:50.399 --> 00:24:52.029 align:start position:0%
update is how that is being
addressed

00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:52.039 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:55.710 align:start position:0%
addressed
and

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
if I still haven't had a direct answer
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
to my question which was if we enact
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
this is it going to put a roadblock in
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
the way I I have heard very clearly you
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
say that this is not necessary for you
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
to do the kinds of things that it's
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
suggesting that you can already do them
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
but um I kind of want to hear about
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
those other two things so I'll stop
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
talking there let you answer so let me
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
get to the financial stability questions
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
and that's why I have our trusty uh CFO
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
here with us um so what happened is so
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
actually as of and it's all of this is
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
in your information um through October
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
23rd a total of
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
1.6.9 million has been paid out um to
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
agencies now we did have to over the
 
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.269 align:start position:0%
agencies now we did have to over the
summer

00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
summer
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
what that's what I
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
said 106.9 sorry that's the smaller of
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
the two that I handed to you the two
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
pages and that's on the second
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:25:58.669 align:start position:0%
pages and that's on the second
page

00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
I did 1 million yeah we'd all know be
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
sitting here right
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
um so of that um
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
63.8 million has been paid to area
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
agencies and this was a combination of
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
some manual payments um and them
 
00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
entering directly into
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
mmis 41.3 million has been paid um
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
through our mmis system for non- Area
 
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
Agency providers and then we made um
 
00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
about 1.8 million in manual payments for
 
00:26:32.669 --> 00:26:32.679 align:start position:0%
four providers three of them had area
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
agencies as trading partners and um so
 
00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:40.039 align:start position:0%
initially um we had asked for the
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
paybacks of some of the manual payments
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
to be to occur by December 31st um but
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
Melissa um has been working with her
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
team and the agencies and if an agency
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
is unable to do that we um are extending
 
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm still having a hard time
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
understanding why if these were monies
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
that were owed to them they have to pay
 
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
that were owed to them they have to pay
them

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
back good afternoon uh Nathan white CFO
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
um so I I will answer your question in a
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
circulatory way but I promise I will
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
answer your question so I I think it's
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
important to point out that so as Chris
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
was saying as of October 23rd about $107
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
million has been paid out if you look at
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
the budget that our our our budget for
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
this area is almost $370
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
million so we are spending along the
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
lines of the budget so when I I don't I
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
I I can't I wasn't here previously so I
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
can't comment necessarily on what was
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
said relative to that um but it does
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
appear based on the dollars that are
 
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
going out the door right now that we are
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
in line with the budget as a legislature
 
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519 align:start position:0%
appropriated it um the the the pay
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
payback methodology so because of some
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
of the challenges with um with the I
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
believe it's called the echo Vantage
 
00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:06.519 align:start position:0%
system um that that that's the area
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
agency system it's not a state system
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
because because of some of the
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
challenges what we had to do was we had
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
the area agencies provide the estimated
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
numbers and so we made payments on those
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
estimated numbers and then there's a
 
00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation process so that we would
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that there was no Gap in
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
funding to avoid that Financial duress
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
situ situation that that I believe was
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
described at the prior hearing and so as
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
part of that we're working on a
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
methodology to get those funds back um
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
through through you know through
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
withholding or whatever it may be um to
 
00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that you know everybody is
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
whole all the funds that went out the
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
door are accounted for and to try to um
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
try to alleviate any stress that that
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
can be alleviated as we go through this
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
organizational change which you know I
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
think is important to recognize and
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason why why the
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
team and the commissioner met uh with
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
the area agencies to go over that
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
methodology um to to achieve that goal
 
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.070 align:start position:0%
methodology um to to achieve that goal
so

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr White for being
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
here is it simplistically by saying it
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
correctly to the agenes S of prepaid for
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
rendered the the payments were made
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
based on the estimates that that we were
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
provided so yes so there's a
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation process that will'll
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
follow but yes thank you okay yes
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
representative Weber followup just just
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
a follow up on that so what is being
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:48.679 align:start position:0%
payments I I I don't know if I would
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
describe it as or characterize it as
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
overpayments but it's essentially to
 
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that if there were any overpay
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
if there were any overpayments that the
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
state is due the money that it's owed
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
right but you you understand why I'm I'm
 
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
confused here because
 
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:10.519 align:start position:0%
either it was an estimated payment for
 
00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:13.799 align:start position:0%
services rendered and if the services
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
were in fact rendered nothing should be
 
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.509 align:start position:0%
were in fact rendered nothing should be
paid

00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:18.519 align:start position:0%
paid
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
back or it was an overpayment for
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
services that have not been rendered in
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
which case it's perfectly Fair to ask
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
payback but if it isn't a
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
payback then and it is payment for
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
services rendered then I don't
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
understand why the agencies have to pay
 
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.950 align:start position:0%
understand why the agencies have to pay
anything

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
back and I know I'm being stupid here
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
but it's not making sense yeah no again
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
this was a stop Gap effort to make sure
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
that given the system challenges and the
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
bill the billing challenges that were
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
being experienced that that those could
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
be rectified so we provided estimates
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
and some of those estimates May they're
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
estimates they now they may not actually
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
be actuals um and and so I believe the
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
date set for for for many was was
 
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
shooting for December 31st um right now
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
we may not necessarily get there it may
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
be January February time frame if if not
 
00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
longer depending on the circumstances um
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
for for that for that payback Chris what
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
did you want to add something no just we
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
have sorry we're juggling here I think
 
00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
the other piece to um recognize in the
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
whole reconciliation process is that we
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
have our own federal reporting to CMS
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
that we have to account for um the
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
providers doing a billing for the
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
service and so this stock Gap allowed us
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
to give them an estimated payment
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
without having um a billing completed so
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
we have to reconcile on our end as well
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
saying yes these Services were rendered
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
the billing was completed in our system
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
um and so that's the other reason why
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a a payout and a
 
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
payback so it is a
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
payback when they're paying back it's
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
paying back for an overpayment made for
 
00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:11.559 align:start position:0%
services that were not because they've
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
builded for the service yes
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
Nel thank you madam chairman thanks for
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm I I'm confused
 
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
also I guess I think so I I've had a
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
number of conversations with agency and
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
and they've informed me that they're
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
having to dig into savings some of them
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
have them some of them don't have them
 
00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:36.039 align:start position:0%
um and that they're really struggling
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
financially so the impression that I'm
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
getting is that they're not being
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for the services that are
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
being provided and on number four on
 
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
page two here it says you
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
know that um the title is how much has
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
been paid compared to what's been buil
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing a number that's been paid but
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's been build and they
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
equal or is I I don't want to answer
 
00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
but I think it it's because we don't
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily know we know that of what
 
00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
has been build about 177% has been
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
denied um but I don't know uh exactly
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
what's been built follow um yes follow
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
up so by Deni you mean are we getting to
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
the prior authorization
 
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
that's no it's us a data entry error or
 
00:33:30.629 --> 00:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
it could have been a duplicate claim
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's denied at the
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
mmis and my light may have finally gone
 
00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
on is the issue that the prepayment was
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
made by the
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
department in anticipation of sums that
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
were to be paid by someone other than
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
the department so the department needs
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
to get the Department's funds back
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
once Medicaid has paid what they're
 
00:33:59.629 --> 00:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
supposed to pay is that how it works is
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
problem that we've got two different
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
pockets and have to get everything
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
coming ultimately out of the correct
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
pocket right in order for us to get our
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know our federal matching dollars we
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
need the claiming and the billing to be
 
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
done in mismis so giving that payment
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
that estimated payment is not based on
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
any of those claims um so in order for
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
us to be able to get that Federal match
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
through Medicaid we those billing claims
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be done through mmis and not a
 
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.750 align:start position:0%
to be done through mmis and not a
prepayment

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
prepayment
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
gotcha and to answer the question
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
Melissa and her team have been working
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
with agencies that are unable to pay
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
that back um and extending
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
times okay thank you and I'll start
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
again but I want other people to have
 
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to ask one question
 
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
before I
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
represent recognize somebody else I see
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
that you have the amount that are paid
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
and the amount that are denied how many
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
of these claims are still pending how
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
what's the dollar value of the pending
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
claims I don't have that um we can find
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
that information for you but it's goes
 
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
into mmis and it's either paid or denied
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
um I think are you asking about service
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
authorizations that may be pending uh no
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I this is the first that I
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
have heard of something that as soon as
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
it goes in it's either paid or denied as
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
opposed to there being a processing time
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
how long is a process in time between
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
submitting the claim and either approval
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
or denial because I'm curious how what
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
the dollar figure is whether that's a
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
one- day lag or a 15-day lag or a three
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
Monon lag that's what I'm trying to
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
understand because that's one of those
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
cash flow issues that comes based on the
 
00:35:45.069 --> 00:35:45.079 align:start position:0%
time to I don't have the mmis schedule
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
here in front of us but we can get you
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
that information typically it's I I
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to estimate thank you because
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
that may be one of the discrepancies
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
between what's actually paying out
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
what's expected and that may be
 
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
something that we may not have
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
identified as a challenge U
 
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.589 align:start position:0%
identified as a challenge U
representative

00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
 
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
question I think this is probably for Mr
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
White it helps me understanding that it
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's really a cash flow
 
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
issue between the state and the FEDS to
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
a c some degree and at that point in
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
time a question I think before you folks
 
00:36:23.359 --> 00:36:25.030 align:start position:0%
time a question I think before you folks
collectively

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
collectively
 
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
individually if we miss the December
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
31st reconciliation between the fed and
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
the state which deals with the matching
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
grants and so forth can we take activity
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
in one quarter and roll it over to the
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
next quarter as within a fiscal year or
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
is the December 31st a hard fast rule
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
that if something's not reconciled on
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
December 31st but the activity occurred
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
in October but the bills didn't actually
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
come in what I'm trying to get to is
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
trying to understand when you're giving
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
a prepayment
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
that's not paid for a service that's
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
based upon anticipation of a service but
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government's only going
 
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursed based upon actual not what's
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
anticipated but the actual anticipation
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
I'm looking from a cash flow point of
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
view if something happens in a
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
prepayment in October but you don't have
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
a bill to reconcile with the feds until
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
after December 31st can you still do it
 
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.630 align:start position:0%
after December 31st can you still do it
in

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
January yeah so when when the department
 
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.109 align:start position:0%
January yeah so when when the department
um

00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
initially met with the area agencies to
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
come up with this solution December was
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
a goal and if it needs to move into
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
January or February I think that's
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine I think where we would um
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
collectively start to get into a bit of
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
trouble is if we approach State fiscal
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
year end I I think that that's where we
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
would have some serious problems I'm
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
hoping we can get everything resolved
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
long before that time but again December
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
was the initial tentative goal based on
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
what seemed appropriate at that time um
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
I again as Chris stated at the beginning
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
I think we're collectively committed to
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
making sure that this that this works um
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
and so if if one Area Agency can't
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily get to that December 31st
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
date then we will work with them and and
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
Melissa and her team have been meeting
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
with area agencies that have voiced
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
their concerns um relative to any cash
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
flows to work out a solution towards
 
00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
towards a a a
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
ending you follow up thank you one thing
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
we talked about last time we
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
met is that sometimes it comes within
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
the department itself is the need to
 
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
move money from one line to another line
 
00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
temporarily and that has to go to the
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee is there any
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
requirement in your opinion now that we
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
have to go to the fiscal committee to
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
ask for some lency from the fiscal
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee to allow the department to
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
move money from from one bucket to
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
another while we work our way through
 
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
this no this is all paid out of class
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
7100 and you have one over there oh
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
fantastic representative
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
Nel thank you madam chairman this is
 
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
very simple when's your fiscal year
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
end June 30th what I thought thank
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
Weber okay so now I'm going to go off on
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
another tack if I may yeah um thank you
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
for all of this because it is
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
complicated and we are learning and it's
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
important for us to have a better
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
understanding but it seems to me that we
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
are talking about apples and oranges
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
here I mean on the one hand there is the
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
cash flow issue that it is important for
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
all of us to understand and perhaps to
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
monitor going forward in which case we
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
have several mechanisms including the
 
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services oversight
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
committee or possibly an ad hoc
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
Committee of Health and Human Services
 
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
either of which could do that work but
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
we also have a bill in front of us and
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
what we're here today to decide is what
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
to do about that bill and what I'm
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
hearing from you is everything that's in
 
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
the bill you already can do what I hear
 
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:19.640 align:start position:0%
from some people is we want to make darn
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
sure it's done so we want to put it into
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
statute um
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
and I think what what we're here for
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
today is to make a decision on whether
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
we are going to pass this or not so
 
00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:39.630 align:start position:0%
we are going to pass this or not so
um

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard anything that sounds
 
00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
like the department will come to a
 
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
screeching halt if we pass this and I
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
have heard of a lot of people who would
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
be more comfortable if we pass this
 
00:40:59.710 --> 00:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that it doesn't actually
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
help with the problem we've just been
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
starting about except that it might keep
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
us out of a new one somewhere down the
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
line so I'm I'm hoping that as soon as
 
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
everybody's satisfied with the question
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
I don't want to stop anybody from
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
getting a full understanding because I
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
think it's very important uh but I'm I'm
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
just hoping that we all refocus
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves to the language of the bill as
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
soon as that's finished so thank you
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
representative Weber um I think that one
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
of the other questions regarding the
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
staging and this planning and the
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
necessity to Pilot something to roll out
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
smaller than to the whole state um
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
that's relevant is a question on the
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
billing integration to the mmis system
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
and how much visibility was provided to
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
the area agencies and everybody else who
 
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
would be direct billing so that they
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
could have a system online and ready to
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
go July 1st so that they could integrate
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
and not run into issues of having to
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
manually bill or otherwise request funds
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
provided thank you for the question I
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
think um from the Department standpoint
 
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
we worked closely with Area Agency
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
specifically um but also with providers
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
as far as what this may look like and
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not here to say that it
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
worked 100% smoothly on the Department's
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
uh part as far as data
 
00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
conversion um service authorization
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
issues I I I'm not claiming that that
 
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
was 100% an A+ um and we've said that to
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
our providers and area agencies what I
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
do think is that um on both ends there
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
were glitches as far as um our data
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
conversion um the ability for the area
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
agencies themselves to bill with their
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
software that they were using or are
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
using um and still having that inability
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
in in some cases to bill so um I think
 
00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:02.839 align:start position:0%
we were visible very visible I think
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're still um working in Partnership to
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
we have one-on-one meetings with
 
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
providers to work through whether it's a
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
service authorization issue whether it's
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
an mismis issue whether it's a
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
remittance issue and we're taking that
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
one by one with each provider um in
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
order to figure out from a from a
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh where the roadblock is is that there
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
in software is it us is it our service
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
authorizations that need to be updated
 
00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:33.559 align:start position:0%
so I would say that we've certainly been
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
U very visible and um available to
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
anyone that asks or needs
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
assistance thank you and I just to
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
follow up you know mismis that's what
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
all Medicaid providers use to Bill and
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
um you know some providers build
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
directly depending on how many claims
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
they have others use trading partners
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
others have their own billing software
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
um so the mmis system is not a new
 
00:44:03.549 --> 00:44:03.559 align:start position:0%
system um so usually my role in new it
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
roll outs is to be an early user because
 
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
I'm really good at breaking stuff but
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
because I'm generally their great
 
00:44:12.829 --> 00:44:12.839 align:start position:0%
breaking user um a lot of times I've
 
00:44:14.829 --> 00:44:14.839 align:start position:0%
talked with it departments and usually
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
they end up having some sort of scope
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
and some sort of set of information
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
about what they need to integrate into
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
um and I know that I can't ask for that
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
right now but if you could provide any
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
documentation that you provided to the
 
00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
area agencies and those doing their own
 
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
direct billing about what their systems
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
needed in specific so that they would be
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
ready to launch and integrate with the
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
MMS mmis system that would be helpful
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
and I know that this seems like sort of
 
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
an an after action trying to figure out
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
what happened but the question also is
 
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
going forward you know I know I've been
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
accused of springing things on people
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
the last minute as I handed some of
 
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
these out um but this this is different
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
than making sure that people are able to
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
bill for millions of dollars of money to
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
provide care um to have an idea of how
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
how it was handled with this integration
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
so we can get an idea of sort of what
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
the process has been and how and how
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
necessary it is to continue on making
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
sure that there's not just your eyes who
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
are focused in at ground level on the
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
implementation but a few people that can
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
fly over on the surveillance drones and
 
00:45:20.549 --> 00:45:20.559 align:start position:0%
spot something that you're not able to
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
see because I expect that your
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
Department's experiencing the same
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
staffing issues as everybody else is
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
that something that would be available
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
that you could make
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
available yes I think um all of our um
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
work groups are generally posted and and
 
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
online on YouTube so we can certain it
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
might take us a little bit to get that
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
to you but we certainly can pull any
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
trainings or meetings that we had had as
 
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
it relates to how that billing piece
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
would work um thank you and more
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
specifically it would be any document
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
that went out because discussing the
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
general principles doesn't help you to
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
purchase a system that will allow you to
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
bill um and and then um sorry any were
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
there other questions representative
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
Merchant oh sorry and co- calleded after
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant wanted to follow thank you for
 
00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.470 align:start position:0%
Merchant wanted to follow thank you for
the

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
question Mr mam chair following up on
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
represent Weber looking at the
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think I'm hearing much of
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
an issue from the Department's point of
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
view as far as this bill interfering
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
with what you need to
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
accomplish I do understand from the
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
provider's point of view that there are
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
concerns sometimes along the way and
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes when you have two parties if
 
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
you will in this case multiple parties
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
and one part is saying yes it will work
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
one part saying no it won't work and so
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
forth it's a difficult place to
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
be we're fortunate because in the
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
legislative body we do have an oversight
 
00:46:51.549 --> 00:46:51.559 align:start position:0%
committee and maybe the option would be
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
that when you have a situation and maybe
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's a report coming back before you
 
00:46:58.109 --> 00:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
move on to the next phase that you go to
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee and they sign
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
off on it and it gives them they've been
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
the other people on the other side of
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
providers an opportunity to come to the
 
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and discuss the
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
concerns so at that point in time you
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
have the agency on one side that says
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
yes it's a green light the other one
 
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
said well I think it's more of a yellow
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
light but there's somebody the will to
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
act that sort of an arbitrator to listen
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
to what the concerns are and ultimately
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
make a decision to move forward or not
 
00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
I I actually think that may be more
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
feasible than a pilot and then
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
legislation for a pilot using either the
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
existing oversight committee because I
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns I would have is if
 
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
you know we do testing we get ready to
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
go and we don't necessarily need a pilot
 
00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
or it's the rates for the dsps which
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
many providers need so we we don't want
 
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
any of the work to get held up um but if
 
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
there's a way that we could go to either
 
00:48:04.589 --> 00:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee of this committee or
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
oversight committee I'm not sure that
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
maybe would make more
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
sense like to follow I me I I like the
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
concern the concept of a subcommittee
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
because sometimes it gets relatively
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
into the weeds and when you get to the
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
oversight committee there's so much
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
going on with the oversight committee
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
they may not have the time to put into
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
it that needs to be put into it so maybe
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
a sub Committee of this committee would
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
make more sense not that I want to
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
create more work but I think at that
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
point in time is take it out of the
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
bigger picture and bring it into
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
something really focus on what this
 
00:48:33.839 --> 00:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
something really focus on what this
issue

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
is thank you representative
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
kofalt uh thank you madam chair and um I
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
guess I just want to it's it's comments
 
00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
more than questions at this point
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
um there was some discussion about sort
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
of getting some visibility to what's
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
happened in the past I'm not so
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about what's happened in the
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
past I want to I'm concerned about
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
what's happened in in the future or
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in the future and
 
00:48:59.710 --> 00:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
that we continue services and so what
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
I've heard is that you're going to focus
 
00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
on compliance and um you you essentially
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
have a a a kind of road map for Rolling
 
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
the you
 
00:49:14.109 --> 00:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
know stabilizing the plan going forward
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
I think that that's what's
 
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.069 align:start position:0%
I think that that's what's
necessary

00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
um when the chair opened the session uh
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
you used the the phrase support how can
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature support you
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
and that we need to be observant um I
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
guess my concern
 
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
about a pilot program at this point is
 
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
that we're sort of beyond that point we
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
need I think we need to be concerned
 
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:39.990 align:start position:0%
need I think we need to be concerned
about

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
the the unintended effects of of putting
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
things in
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
statute um that that are that
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
prescriptive on the other hand I would I
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
would I would Echo representative
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
Merchant's comments that I I think this
 
00:49:55.119 --> 00:49:56.190 align:start position:0%
Merchant's comments that I I think this
is

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
important enough that it calls for a
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
kind of focused attention and not
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
something that is on the agenda with a
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
bunch of other things uh with the the um
 
00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
DHHS oversight committee um so
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
personally I would be very strongly in
 
00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:13.799 align:start position:0%
favor of of kind of a subcommittee of
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services committee
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
to be continuing to monitor progress
 
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
going forward but um I guess my concern
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
is that you know we have we have the
 
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
division between the executive branch
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
and the legislative function for for
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
reason and
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
um as much as I think it's important for
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
us to
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
be ensuring that that we can continue
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
delivering these
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
Services I'm I'm a little bit concerned
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
about legislation that continues to say
 
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
You must have a pilot program
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
um so so that's my my general comment
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
um the other the other concern I have is
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
I know that because the department has
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
worked with um with the area agencies
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
and essentially has said we we'll step
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
in to solve the cash flow problem until
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
things are are more
 
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
stable I think that there is some fear
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
and anxiety around the repayment
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
schedule for that or that's what I've
 
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
been hearing anyway and I've also heard
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
that the department is working with
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
those area agencies to make sure that
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
those kinds of concerns get resolved yet
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
I'm still I still heard those concerns
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
so I guess that that's maybe there maybe
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's a question in there that is is
 
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
there anything that we can do to sort of
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
match the the repayment schedule with
 
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
the incoming funds that that come to the
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
agencies for for the from from the
 
00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.430 align:start position:0%
agencies for for the from from the
mismis

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
mismis
 
00:51:47.789 --> 00:51:47.799 align:start position:0%
building yes thank you for that comment
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
um we are working one-on-one with area
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
agencies looking at their ability to
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
Bill what they're taking in from billing
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
versus you know their cash flow needs to
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
meet meet payroll um to meet their
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
weekly or monthly expenses so we've met
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
with several area agencies on either
 
00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
pausing the repayment schedule for now
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
until they can bill out an amount that
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
keeps them solvent um or um you know
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
looking at a different percentage of a
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
repayment so as the area agencies come
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
to us we are meeting with them oneon-one
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
to determine what's best for their
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
business for from their perspective okay
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
follow up yes follow up um
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
is there anything that can be done to
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
make that a little bit
 
00:52:33.069 --> 00:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
more um predictable I'll say because
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
that the the concern I'm hearing is that
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
well yes we can go ask for an extension
 
00:52:37.599 --> 00:52:39.150 align:start position:0%
well yes we can go ask for an extension
but

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
there's it it's hard to it's hard to
 
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
forecast cash flow based on ad hoc
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
conversations that come up so I guess
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
that's and I don't expect that there's
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be an answer coming
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
out of this discussion today because I
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
think that's requires some more research
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
and planning but that's something that
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
I've heard and I guess that would be
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
a a question to you is that something
 
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
that you can look into and consider the
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
feasibility of sure thank
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
Weber so following up on what
 
00:53:14.349 --> 00:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
representative kofalt said um I am very
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
much in agreement with most of what he
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
said and and here's my concern with the
 
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
proposal from representative
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
Merchant uh I'm
 
00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:28.839 align:start position:0%
very concerned I I mean I think I think
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
we may have moved past the Pilot Point
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
in which
 
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.549 align:start position:0%
in which
case

00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
um the changes I think proposed by
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
representative Lon for page one lines 3
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
to7 are actually very helpful because
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
it's already kind of in train but
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps we might not need to be as
 
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
directive as what's in paragraph to uh
 
00:53:58.349 --> 00:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
which is very
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
directive um and you
 
00:54:06.789 --> 00:54:06.799 align:start position:0%
know two and three are very directive so
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering about whether we need
 
00:54:11.309 --> 00:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
to do some noodling around with that and
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
making them less directive but what I'm
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
also concerned about I share very much
 
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
the concern about simply reporting to
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services oversight
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee which is snowed under with
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
reports at the moment
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh but the concept of having an
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
executive department report and
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
be potentially blocked from action by a
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of a legislative
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh begins to give me hives
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
from the dimly recollected days of my
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
law school proceedings where uh we
 
00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.349 align:start position:0%
law school proceedings where uh we
really

00:54:52.349 --> 00:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
are getting away from the concept that I
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
understand about separation of powers so
 
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
and and I I would be very concerned
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room is a person of
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
very good will but delegating that kind
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
of power to a subcommittee of a
 
00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.870 align:start position:0%
of power to a subcommittee of a
committee

00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:13.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
feels risky for the future um in terms
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
of wow do we want to start having little
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that can block or overrule
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
an executive
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
agency going forward so that that makes
 
00:55:31.789 --> 00:55:31.799 align:start position:0%
me very concerned if we have a
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that actually the purpose
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
of which is to continue this dialogue
 
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
which I think is very
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
productive um then that would not I
 
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
would be very much in favor of that I'm
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a little anxious when we say that
 
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
either Health and Human Services
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
oversight or a subcommittee of some kind
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
can actually hold up
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
the actions of the
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
department um you know what what we're
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
really trying to do is help the
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
department move the actions forward
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
faster rather than than slow them down
 
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
so those are my concerns with sort of
 
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
the stuff I've heard so far um and
 
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
I I really wonder if we might not be
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
able to resolve this by not heading
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
forward with the bill at all
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
but by making a recommendation to Health
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
and Human Services that we set up some
 
00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:34.839 align:start position:0%
kind of a subcommittee to hear from the
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
Department regular intervals about how
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
things are going forward because on on
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
the one hand I don't see that the
 
00:56:41.839 --> 00:56:43.510 align:start position:0%
the one hand I don't see that the
piloting

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
piloting
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
requirements are really relevant to
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
where we are now um but on the other
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
hand I think that understanding what's
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
happening going forward and and perhaps
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
being able to nudge things when nudges
 
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
are needed is really helpful so that's
 
00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
I'm I I've changed my position on all of
 
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
this at least four times since I walked
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
in this morning but I I wonder how how
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
that's feeling to people uh thank you
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I have a question
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
um about the Staffing levels of the
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
department do you have empty positions
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
um have those begun since the change
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
over so I can speak on uh behalf of the
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Developmental services so we
 
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
currently have two key positions that
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
are vacant that we're recruiting for so
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
a bureau chief and a chief operating
 
00:57:38.589 --> 00:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
officer so two positions that you know
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
are key to the work um but we have
 
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
really dedicated staff that has been um
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
on this project before I even started
 
00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
that department about two years ago that
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
um have been working tirelessly on this
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
so while we do have two key openings um
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
we have dedicated staff to this
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
project um and Nathan will talk broader
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
but I also want to say and I think
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's some of the reason why um we also
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
agree with some of the pausing and
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
delaying any other work um so that our
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
staff can catch up as well so that they
 
00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:13.799 align:start position:0%
can you know kind of make sure
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
everything from the compliance is good
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
before we do anything new recognizing
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
their limitations as well and um
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
speaking uh from a broad perspective in
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
December of 2022 or 20 yes 2022 we had a
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
22% vacancy rate um we have been able to
 
00:58:38.109 --> 00:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
make a lot of progress on that last um
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
report I saw we were hovering around
 
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
18% vacancy rate um part of that was due
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
to the prior year we had a Personnel
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
back of the budget cut of 22.6 million
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
um this year we do have a back of the
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
budget cut it's not targeted at
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
personnel only
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and to date that has freed us up and
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
allowed us to recruit a little bit more
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
aggressively than we have in the past um
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
so in almost a year we've seen a 5%
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
vacancy drop which I I think globally is
 
00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
fantastic um but I'll pause there okay
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for for that I guess
 
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
it's not our job to be in your hiring
 
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
but I'm I wonder if it might be easier
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
if there's people that deserve to be
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
promoted within and then recruit for the
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
other positions it might be a good thing
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
to think of yeah we always start um
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
within um and then go from there
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful that seems to be the least
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
disruptive especially when they know
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on representative
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
chair like reps the Weber I vacillate
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
between the roles
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
that I do respect and appreciate the
 
00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
separation of powers and the roles that
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
we both play however I'm also looking at
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
it from a pragmatic point of view that
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
if there's an agencies out there in a
 
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:55.750 align:start position:0%
if there's an agencies out there in a
state

00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the agency holds all the
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
cards there's the whether the agencies
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
that you're dealing with like it or not
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's your call all I'm trying to do is
 
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
find a vehicle that we can allow for
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
both sides of the fence to have a
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
conversation sort of maybe a neutral
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
body although according to the lawyers
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
that's not so neutral as I thought it
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
would be but I think it means there be
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
some safety valve in there if there's a
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
sounding board that people can go to and
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
people can at that point in time make
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
sort of a judgment call whether they
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
should go forward or not go forward I'm
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
not saying that you wouldn't be allowed
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
to go forward because ultimately you're
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
executive branch and you can do as you
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
wish because that's the way the law was
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
written however I think if you have a
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that you're responsible to
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
before you move forward it probably be
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
be in your best interest to be sure
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
things are Ved correctly before you move
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
forward against the advice of the
 
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
agencies or maybe the advice of the
 
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.390 align:start position:0%
agencies or maybe the advice of the
legisl

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
legisl
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
body thank you representative Merchant
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
um that's actually one of the reasons
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
why I think that continuing along with
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
this while perhaps having that
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee may be helpful because the
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee may be able to speak to the
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
Senate as they're hearing the bill and
 
01:01:09.309 --> 01:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
see if there is if there are any
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
necessary changes or if this was
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
required U my understanding when you
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
were discussing the change out to the
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
rate setting was that you're essentially
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
going to be doing a pilot program by
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
triing this with some providers is that
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.950 align:start position:0%
triing this with some providers is that
correct

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
so we're we're working with Myers and
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
stoffer and have been um throughout this
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
process and looking at rates um based on
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
in cost information that we're receiving
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
um we have not developed a pilot so to
 
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
speak as far as what the that would look
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
like as we don't have the rates yet we
 
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what the fiscal impact looks
 
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:51.559 align:start position:0%
like um to test those rates so um if we
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
were to do and again working with the
 
01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:55.839 align:start position:0%
area agencies and and the providers that
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
provide the services we would want to do
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
some sort of testing of those rates to
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
see if they're viable um or if we need
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
to course correct but we're we're not
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
even at that point yet as we don't have
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
draft rates um for the the entirety of
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
our service delivery okay so to clarify
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
that once you know what the draft rates
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
are you would roll it out to a subset of
 
01:02:21.549 --> 01:02:21.559 align:start position:0%
the population and not Statewide well
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
that that would be part of our
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
discussion with our setting group as far
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
as what does that testing look like does
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
it look like for a specific service does
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
it look like for a specific um entity um
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
so we haven't defined that because we
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
just haven't gotten to that place yet
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
but that would be a discussion that we
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
have with our rate setting group that
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
includes stakeholders as far as are
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
there certain service Service rates we
 
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
want to trial um to see if they uh make
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
a a service more intriguing for a
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
provider to provide um and and what does
 
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
that look like as far as Workforce
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
Development as well okay so with that
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
either Regional or targeted based upon
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
certain codes correct exactly yep thank
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
you um and then with the electronic
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
visit verification we're a rural state
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
with bad cell coverage uh is this one
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
that you all I know that this is
 
01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:16.039 align:start position:0%
federally required is this something
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
that you're planning to sort of run
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
parallel as you integrate the first
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
adoption and see if it's viable um and
 
01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
then see if there needs to be any
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
requests to DC to change the
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
requirements or are you planning on a
 
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide roll out when you do move
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
forward with the
 
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
evv um so evv can you hear me it doesn't
 
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
sound like the microphone's on evv is
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
larger than BDS it is um Medicaid home
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
health services and personal care
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
services and so there's been a lot of
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
work um with all so Home Health
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
Providers um choices for Independence
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
providers it's it's a large um
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
undertaking and so they are working with
 
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and working with the it
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's been extended a couple of times and
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
right now the roll out is March and
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's another compliance issue and we
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
have been paying fines up to this point
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
state and and just to give a little bit
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
of context for personal care services to
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
date we've about a million dollar um
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
back to the federal government that you
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
haven't really seen a big impact um on
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
our budget though because we've been
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
receiving the enhanced fmap rate um so
 
01:04:37.269 --> 01:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
instead of getting the 6 point
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
additional 6.2 we've effectively been
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
getting a 5.2 however come January 1 of
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
2024 all- enhanced fmap will be leaving
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
so um for personal care services we'll
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
be paying about $140,000 in penalties um
 
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
we have a waiver for home healthcare
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
Services up until January 1
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
2024 um uh quarterly we'll be paying
 
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.349 align:start position:0%
2024 um uh quarterly we'll be paying
about

01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:05:03.549 --> 01:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
$28,000 in 20 in state fiscal year 24
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's not too much um but that
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
essentially will um uh the the 0.25%
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
penalty we're paying it'll increase to
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
0.575 and then 1% um so by 2027 if we're
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
still not in compliance at that point
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
for Home Healthcare Services it'll be
 
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.549 align:start position:0%
for Home Healthcare Services it'll be
about

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
$112,000 annually if you adjust for um
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
utilization that'll probably a little
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
higher so uh collectively in four years
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
I mean we could be playing about 250,000
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
or more each quarter in penalties for
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
not being in
 
01:05:36.269 --> 01:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
compliance um thank you um and I guess
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
that also brings us back to the issue of
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
waivers um we're a small state we have
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
about the I I'm not sure when I last did
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
the math but we have about the footprint
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
of San Diego County with about the
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
population of um some some lines you can
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
draw around the city of San Diego um
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
other states like California which holds
 
01:05:57.309 --> 01:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
that are able to push back against some
 
01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
of the federal requirements when it's
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
not a good fit with waivers um and I've
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
seen some of those waivers in place that
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was unsuccessful about
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
pushing for our own waivers um I'm
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
curious what the process is and the
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
decisions are around pushing not just
 
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
for waivers of extension but simply
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
waivers because the prescription that's
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
coming from DC doesn't fit the reality
 
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
of how care is provided in New Hampshire
 
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
and who's in charge of those decisions
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
so I will have to reach out to our
 
01:06:27.549 --> 01:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director Henry Litman um
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
because this is work that he's been
 
01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
doing I do know that New Hampshire um
 
01:06:35.549 --> 01:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
did have a good faith exemption that
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
expires um in December January 1st so we
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
can follow up with Henry if there was
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
any other exemptions and get back to you
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you then as a followup um
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
did that does that mean that the
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
decision about whether or not to pursue
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
a waiver resided with Henry Lipman or
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
did it reside with somebody within the
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
department to ultimately not pursue
 
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.470 align:start position:0%
department to ultimately not pursue
another

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
extension well Henry Works within our
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
department so yeah so I'll I'll follow
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
up with Henry on that so he is the one
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
who made the decision not to proceed in
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
a waiver no um it's a collective
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
decision at the department so I'll
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
follow up with Henry on the details of
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
that okay I'd love to know who's
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
involved so I can speak with them some
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
more thank
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
Weber so to get back to the bill what
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
are we going to do with the
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
bill and I had another
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
thought even while we were
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
talking which
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
is perhaps the thing to do with the
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill is to refer it to interim study and
 
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
properly interim study it by having a
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
meeting every couple of months to see
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
where we are with it as as we have every
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
right to
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
do um and that will give the
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
committee the ongoing dialogue going
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
forward without putting what may turn
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
out to be a roadblock in somebody's way
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
so I wonder how committee members would
 
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
feel about that as an
 
01:08:16.269 --> 01:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
option um thank you representative
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
kofalt um I I think that's an excellent
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
idea um before we move on to a decision
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there are other
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the room who want an
 
01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak though so I so my
 
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
my initial reaction is I I like that
 
01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
that proposal quite a lot uh but I'd
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
like to hear from others if there are
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
others here um thank you I think that's
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
a very intriguing idea um we actually um
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're now a little bit after 2 o'clock
 
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
and I know that the department had
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
penciled Us in for 1 to two um I would
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
hope that before we hear the other
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we could recess this work
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
session and open up 317 so we could ask
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
some important questions from the
 
01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
department on that so with that I will
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh recess our work session on House Bill
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
608 you have to recess it to a Time
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
certain so res uh to to 2:30 or
 
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
something like that I I'll recess it
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
until 2:30 um and if we run over on 317
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit then we can figure that out
 
01:09:14.349 --> 01:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
okay um so I'll recess it until 2:30
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
today we can then start it again late
 
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
but yes we can well if we can start it
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
late let's recess it to h i yeah 2:30
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
works that way we can get some water
 
01:09:24.239 --> 01:09:25.669 align:start position:0%
works that way we can get some water
thank

01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:09:25.679 --> 01:09:27.430 align:start position:0%
thank
you

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay yes I think it's probably better to
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
stay sitting there I will open the work
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
317 um 317 is establishing a commission
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
to study the transition to a two tier
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
waiver for individuals eligible for
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
disability services um as far as I'm
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
concerned the largest question here is
 
01:09:49.709 --> 01:09:49.719 align:start position:0%
when is that expected to happen and is
 
01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
that going to be undertaken before we
 
01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
get through all of these other changes
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
to the system
 
01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
so do I have to Chris santinello
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner I'm not sure if I
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
have to if it's a different
 
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
committee Melissa hery division director
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
for long-term supports and services so
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
um about May of 2022 the department we
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
signaled and shared that we would not be
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
moving forward with a two-tiered waiver
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
and and not even looking at it
 
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
until later 2023 early 2024 and honestly
 
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
it is not even on our radar um so that's
 
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
not something um that we
 
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
have you know I kind of like think about
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's not anything we're
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
looking to pursue right now um I know
 
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
there's a number of changes to our
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
existing waiver there's been a waver
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
subgroup looking at and I think um
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
that's where we want to start
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
strengthening our existing waiver before
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
even looking at a two- teed waiver so
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's not on any
 
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
plans and I I just want to add that we
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
we paused any sort of work on that to
 
01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
tiered waiver based on the feedback that
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
we were received from the stakeholders
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
and families just questioning you know
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
why why would we do this now um you know
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
what this is what does this mean as far
 
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
as services for me and my family and so
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
since we announced back last year in May
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
that we weren't doing any you know work
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
on it we weren't even going to dust it
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
off until maybe at the end of this
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we have not um done any work
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
on developing a two-tier waiver system
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's not on our radar to to
 
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
complete um thank you would what would
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
trigger it to come onto your radar would
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
that be completion of of the current
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
waiver re-evaluation and these other
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
Integrations I think that would be part
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
of it but I also think getting the input
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
from individuals and families and
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
providers as far as is it something that
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
they would want or they would see as a
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
benefit um to the services that they
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
provide um so I think that would be
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
another trigger in looking at it again
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
it would wouldn't be something that we
 
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
could even Implement without you know a
 
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
a CMS waver change and and all of those
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
steps so it's not it's not something
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
that we can do quickly or easily and
 
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do without you know significant
 
01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
input from the community large so
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
timeline wise looking at everything
 
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
you're looking to digest would I assume
 
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't be taking this up
 
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
probably until
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
2026 just given that there are so many
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
challenges and we're practically in 2024
 
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
now I would agree with that yes
 
01:12:30.669 --> 01:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you madam
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
so my understanding now is the way that
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
you deal with patients is on a Case by
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
case patient centered point of view
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
rather than lumping people into
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
categories yes I would say um you know
 
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
individual needs are measured by you
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
know integration with their case
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
management with their family with
 
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
themselves um as far as their individual
 
01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
service agreement um but I think I think
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
you're getting to the point where people
 
01:13:01.229 --> 01:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
thought you were in one tier and maybe
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
if you at a lower tier you needed less
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
or more um and we don't want to create a
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
system where we have you know folks that
 
01:13:10.270 --> 01:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
are perceived as being haves or Have
 
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
Nots and I think that was a lot of the
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
feedback that we received from um the
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
community as far as when you're looking
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
at putting people in
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
buckets I guess I have a followup yes
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah this this issue always
 
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
really troubled me I mean everything
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
that I've dealt with since I've gotten
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
here we we've really stressed dealing
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
with patients as individ or I'm sorry
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
patients clients people
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
individuals you know and a patient
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
centered point of view with their own
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
individual needs and I really struggled
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
with this concept of a tiered
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
system just defying that and and that
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
bothered me a lot I understand from a
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents point of view it might
 
01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
have made sense but from a human point
 
01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
of view it really didn't um I'm
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
still struggling with this concept when
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
I read the the report though it it
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
talked about multiple tiers not just a
 
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
two or a three and I'm still confused
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
why a two would have even been picked
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
versus a three because they gave
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations for both um I mean the
 
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
Le the more tiers the better as far as
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned but why why would his two-
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
tiered even picked in the first
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
place I can see the recommendation from
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
a cons our consultant would have been
 
01:14:24.189 --> 01:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
people who you know require a higher
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
level of care whether that's Residential
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
Care um you know if they required
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
one-on-one supports which um cost
 
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
obviously more than folks that may need
 
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
a lower level of Assistance or services
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
in the community so kind of looking at
 
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
those two um separate tiers but I I
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
think we agree with you as far as you
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
know um even putting people in three
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
tiers there's still you know bucketing
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
of individuals and we really want to
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
make it a whole person approach thank
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:14:56.669 --> 01:14:56.679 align:start position:0%
Weber and
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
just sort of echoing and following on
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
from what representative Nagel was
 
01:15:02.910 --> 01:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
saying it seems to me that the thing
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
that people were
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
particularly pleased with and
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable with was the
 
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
flexibility that has been traditionally
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
available and I think anything we can do
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
to preserve that
 
01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
to preserve that
because

01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
um you
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's people and and nobody's going to
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
have the same set of needs they just
 
01:15:32.669 --> 01:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
aren't built that way so the more
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility we can build
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
in to any system going forward the
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
better and locking people into a tier
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
feels really wrong that brings me to the
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
question and you can all sing the chus
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
with me what are we going to do with
 
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.149 align:start position:0%
with me what are we going to do with
this

01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
bill uh because it seems to me in many
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
ways like having a commission to study
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
something that is not contemplated going
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
forward is probably not a good use of
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
anybody's time but once again I don't
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
want to lose sight of the problem or
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's attempts to address the
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
problem uh so I don't want anybody to
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
think that what we might be doing is
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
just throwing up our hands and walking
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
away or sweeping something under the rug
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
but I don't see this as being
 
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
particularly helpful at this point in
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
time um and and again I would like to
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
hear from other people on that side of
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
the table and I I noticed that the prime
 
01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor is also here thank you
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative Weber my my biggest
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
question would be is does is the
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
department comfortable in saying that
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
they will not they're not that they are
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
that they're not they're that they're
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
not going to start work on a two-tier um
 
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
waiver system until after 2026 at the
 
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
soonest yeah I think we can definitely
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
say that um we actually have a very
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
active w we had an very active waiver
 
01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
work group to look at adding more
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
flexibilities and services to our
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
existing waivers um so that's really
 
01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
where our energy has been and will be so
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
this will not happen before 2026 that's
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
incredibly help
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
um my thought would be that um I'd love
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
to listen to more any more input from
 
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
anybody who's here around this but given
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
um that confidence that the Department's
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
not going to move forward on that before
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
2026 I would think that this would make
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
sense to itl it so um thank you very
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
much for being here and thank you for
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
staying later to be able to get us the
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
information I expect we'll be seeing
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
more of each other just to make sure
 
01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
that everybody's confident in how this
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
process continues to move forward thank
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.110 align:start position:0%
you thank
you

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay um I wanted to see if there's
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wanted to speak to us
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
before we take a vote um would you like
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh Jerry Stringham uh
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
State Rep from Lincoln New Hampshire um
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
basically from what I heard you know
 
01:18:18.189 --> 01:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
when this when this bill was submitted
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh the the working uh plan was the the
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation from the Alvarez and
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
Marcelo report were to be implemented
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
actually by now so there and there was
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
no understanding really of uh how the
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
groups would be divided and what Ser
 
01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
Services would be limited how providers
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
would be uh what services that they were
 
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
used to being able to prescribe were now
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
going to be off limits for some uh for
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
some beneficiary so there was a lot of
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
lot of work to do um to understand that
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
and there was concerns there would be
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
massive unintended consequences if this
 
01:18:58.629 --> 01:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
was implemented um as far as I'm
 
01:19:01.709 --> 01:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
concerned um that uh you know we don't
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
need a commission if uh nothing is going
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
to change or we're going to focus on the
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
other changes that are going on uh you
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
know over the next two and a half years
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
so um uh there was certainly um
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
everybody I talked to from the
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
beneficiary side didn't say it was
 
01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily a bad idea they just didn't
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
understand what would look like and what
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
the consequences would be um there's
 
01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
plenty of willingness to participate in
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
something like that it sounds like uh
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
the department is going towards more
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
flexibility uh in empowering uh the case
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
managers and others to um be able to
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
tailor the services more not limit them
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
as a two-tiered waiver system might have
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
so uh I don't have any issue with iing
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
this bill based on uh where where BDS is
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh gone in the last last year or so so
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
this no thank you very much um is there
 
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else who yes Mr
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
kbis Alex kis
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
microphone my name is Alex kbis with
 
01:20:15.149 --> 01:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
Denny and ble I represent the Community
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
Support Network which is the association
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the tary agencies uh we actually
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
asked representative Stringham to file
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation and we greatly
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank him for being here this afternoon
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
and continuing to follow through on this
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
and it really uh the request came uh for
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
the simple reason that the the
 
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation for this two there's two
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
or three or however many tier waiver
 
01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
system it it it will become was made
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
without families providers at the table
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh we were never saying that we were
 
01:20:47.229 --> 01:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
going to shut the door completely on
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
this but it needs a tremendous amount
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
more study more involvement from the
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
participants in the syst system the
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
providers of the services the workers in
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
the system and obviously from the
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
previous bill you you understand that
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
now is not the time to be changing a
 
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
waiver that was put in place I believe
 
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
in 1983 so that'd be about 40 years it's
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
it's worked well a lot of people depend
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
on that waiver it's uh brought in
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
obviously a tremendous amount of federal
 
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
dollars and provided some unique and
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
Innovative services that keep people in
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
their Community which is where the
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
majority of them uh want to be so uh
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
certainly itl it's fine it's clear it's
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's probably not moving forward anytime
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
soon and uh I think the bill has
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
accomplished uh what we needed to which
 
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
is to put a spotlight on the issue slow
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
it down a little bit have a conversation
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
with our elected officials so we thank
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
the department for uh changing course on
 
01:21:41.709 --> 01:21:41.719 align:start position:0%
this and again thank you and and
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for your uh
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
advocacy for your
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
constituents thank you very much and
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here both at the
 
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
previous hearing and now this work
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
session thank you you're welcome is
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
there anybody else okay thank you I I
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
have I think we're ready for a v vote if
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to make a
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
motion representative Weber I would move
 
01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
itl with thanks to everybody involved
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
for the dialogue that this bill has
 
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
promoted because we have talked about it
 
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
probably more than a commission would
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
have by by now and and that has been
 
01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
very productive and it's also been an
 
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
education I think for all of us on this
 
01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
side of the table so would move
 
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
itl second you second that
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative n is somebody who became
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%

be 50 itl on house bille 317 um and so I
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
will close the work we'll recommend that
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
to the full committee and I will close
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
the work session on 37 we have about 7
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
minutes if we start on time for 6:08 so
 
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
everybody can perfect take care of
 
01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
moment thank
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.480 --> 01:33:13.590 align:start position:0%
 
mics

01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's just after 2:30 so if we can move
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
people back to their seats we can go
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
back to our regularly scheduled
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
programming representative
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
okay okay um and I do know that uh
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes sometimes it uh takes more
 
01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
than a moment to take a break so um I we
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
probably should go ahead and get started
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
seeing who else there is to hear from
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
um yes yes
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%

01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
yourself to the committee I guess I'm
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
officially reopening the work session on
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
608

01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon U my name is Robert
 
01:33:59.629 --> 01:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
Gillis I live in Hancock New Hampshire
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to thank the committee
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
members for allowing me this chance to
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill 608 um I work I'm
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
the executive director for madn
 
01:34:13.470 --> 01:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
WorkSource um we're a small provider of
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
Disability Services located in the badok
 
01:34:19.229 --> 01:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
region uh we've been delivering
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
Disability Services since 19 1971 and
 
01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
just celebrated our 52nd year in
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
existence um we're an incredibly flat
 
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
small entity there's myself I have an
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant four program
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
managers and 23 direct staff who provide
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
services for 34 individuals throughout
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
the madok region um and this process has
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
in some ways um been paralyzing for me
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
as an executive director um because we
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't have a finance department we don't
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
have a billing department we never knew
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
what mmis looked like or even meant
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
because our area agency always took care
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
of that billing for us and so um I've
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
had to dedicate probably 70 to 75% of my
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
time since July 1st on trying to get our
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
agency through the changes that have
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
occurred because of um you know yes the
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
man the
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
mandated CMS rules um but um I would
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
like to again go back and forth on
 
01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
whether I support uh of um the bill
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
itself but um to me as a small entity I
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
attended all of the trainings that were
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
offered by BDS I attended every meeting
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
I could possibly be involved in um and
 
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
we are still um truly suffering
 
01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
financially um and just with me being
 
01:36:01.229 --> 01:36:01.239 align:start position:0%
able to focus on the rest of my job um
 
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
because I've had to dedicate so much of
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
my time to trying to see where our
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
Billings at trying to investigate where
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
the problems are whether it's with
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
service um authorizations whether it's
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
with my managers and what they've build
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
um whether it's been with the third
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
party biller that we've signed up with
 
01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.149 align:start position:0%
party biller that we've signed up with
um

01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
small businesses are the heart of New
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy and you know
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've heard so far today
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
you know really talks about the area
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
agency and the provider agencies and
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
from the tables that I've sat around and
 
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
conquered when I've been part of some of
 
01:36:42.669 --> 01:36:42.679 align:start position:0%
these Endeavors um a lot of the agencies
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
are of the size of Easter Seals um yes
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
they're providers but um it's hard to
 
01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
have a voice as a a small provider in
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
the state and we're by no means the
 
01:36:57.629 --> 01:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
smallest providers um again we support
 
01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
34 individuals um our revenues for our
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
services are about $1.8
 
01:37:06.510 --> 01:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
million um but there are many agencies
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
that are much smaller than ours um and
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
to me a pilot program would have
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
eliminated many of the things that I had
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
to learn kind of on my own after July
 
01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
1st um and so I I would like to suggest
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
that there is close scrutiny whether it
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
be a pilot program um because again the
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
heart of our economy here in New
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a big part of our
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
disability delivery system is small
 
01:37:37.709 --> 01:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
providers like madn work Shores and we
 
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
are truly struggling um we have gotten
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
good billing um we have had money coming
 
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
in but um I am worried about us making
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
our payroll in another week I actually
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
just emailed back and forth with Melissa
 
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
earlier today to try to find a way to
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
possibly have access to some of the
 
01:37:59.470 --> 01:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
funds that they've talked about um
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
because our billing has not been
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
consistent and actually recently it
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
seems to have gotten worse as far as the
 
01:38:11.589 --> 01:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
service authorizations being done on
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
time and properly um and my ability as
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
an overwhelmed executive director to
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
wrap my brain around where the problem
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
is with our bill
 
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
um the mmis system is archaic and
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
Incredibly complicated and has been very
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
very difficult um certainly for myself
 
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
to incorporate into our our daily
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
function so and thank you for the time
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your service
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
to everybody and the amount of time that
 
01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
you spent providing services to people
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we really thank you um
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I just have one question as
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
and then I'll recognize you
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
representative Weber so you said that
 
01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
you're spending 70 to 75% of your time
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
on billing and you're using a third
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
party biller um on on yes on you know
 
01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
billing and as far as the mmis system
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
trying to learn even though we're not
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
doing the billing ourselves um trying to
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
understand what all the coding modifiers
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
mean trying to verify that the numbers
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
that we're receiving for our unit rates
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
are what we should be receiving um it
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
would be nice if we just pushed a button
 
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
and our biller did all the billing for
 
01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
us they've been doing a great Sky great
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
job one sky here um but making sure that
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
all of that billing is happening as it
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
should um is where my energies and time
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
has gone and trying to then investigate
 
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
why we haven't been paid for one of our
 
01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
individuals for over a month now
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
um has been a very cumbersome process
 
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and then with that it sounds
 
01:39:57.390 --> 01:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
like you need to know all the
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
intricacies of Medicaid billing in order
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
to pass it off to your third party
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
biller is that correct exactly yeah
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
maybe not all of it but 90% of it we
 
01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:07.719 align:start position:0%
have to understand because we need to
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
try to help find out why it's not going
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
through properly um and I'd like to be
 
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
proud of my managers it seems like them
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
submitting their attendance has not been
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the problem well thank you
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
and I want to AP my understanding of the
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
switch to third party billers is that it
 
01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
would be pretty easy and similar to what
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
was going on before but it seems that
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't the case representative
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
Weber well I had two things thank you
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for being here
 
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
today taking our questions and doing the
 
01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
work that you do because it's really
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
appreciated um I guess just to follow on
 
01:40:46.030 --> 01:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
what you were saying so the issue for
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
you is ensuring that you have input to
 
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
your biller the proper codes forms
 
01:40:56.189 --> 01:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
whatever needs to be sent to them so
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
that they can do the billing going
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
forward is that
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
correct again that's where the hard part
 
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
is that's one of the components you know
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
the the bigger component is you know
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
looking at what mmis has for manad work
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
source is a printout that's about six
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
feet long and to try to understand why
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
that rate isn't what we were expecting
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
it to be and trying to get to the bottom
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
of why it's wrong has taken me 152
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
emails back and forth to the Service
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
Coordination entities the billing
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
entities um and our organization to try
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I can try to get to
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom of what needs to be fixed for
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
our billing to occur properly and just
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
as a followup and could I just ask you
 
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
if if if we were to interim study this
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill and to try and keep an eye on
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
things going forward I I would just ask
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
please feel free to contact any of us
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm in walpool so I'm in the
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
manad region and I would love to hear
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
from you about issues going forward so
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
we can keep our eye fully on the ball
 
01:42:16.990 --> 01:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
because I I don't want us to just say
 
01:42:19.629 --> 01:42:19.639 align:start position:0%
aha we're done as a legislature I want
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
to keep
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
great thank you and I going forward so
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
please do stay in touch thank you I
 
01:42:29.709 --> 01:42:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
Brett thank you madam
 
01:42:35.589 --> 01:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
chair this is sort of post what you're
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
talking about what was it pre what I'm
 
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
trying to understand is that it's sort
 
01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
of an
 
01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
analogy before you could simply write
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
something on a piece of paper s to give
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
to somebody else who then go to the word
 
01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
process or Word document whatever it's
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
going to be Microsoft Word and so forth
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
and they would create the document for
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
you by using the
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
software I mean now all of a sudden you
 
01:42:59.589 --> 01:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
can't do that you have to understand how
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
to use Microsoft Word in order to create
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
the document because you can't simply
 
01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
just get somebody sort of an invoice but
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
maybe or simplifying what's there
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
because what happened pre that changed
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
Post Yeah we you know again our area
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
agency um was responsible for doing our
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
billing previously you know they also
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
were primarily The Entity that was
 
01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
responsible for our Service Coordination
 
01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
so they worked closely together behind
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
the scenes um and we submitted weekly
 
01:43:36.189 --> 01:43:36.199 align:start position:0%
attendance sheets that you know noted
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
the units that we delivered it was a
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
simple Excel spreadsheet and we gave
 
01:43:43.629 --> 01:43:43.639 align:start position:0%
that to the area agency and two weeks
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
later we got a nice little print out by
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
client that was about 11 pages long as
 
01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
to what we were paid for each of those
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
clients um we'd have a similar type of
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
sheet from one sky that we submit the
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
the days that our services um were
 
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
delivered what our units were um and now
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
the same printout we get is around 78
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
pages long um all on individual lines
 
01:44:15.589 --> 01:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
for individual days for each client and
 
01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:18.639 align:start position:0%
each of their cost centers and trying to
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
compare that to what we were expecting
 
01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
to come in as revenues um is is where
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
part of our difficulty has been then out
 
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
of those the denials that we've had
 
01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
trying to investigate with the area
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
agency Service Coordination folks um has
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
been has been difficult as we have had
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
difficulties with Workforce I know the
 
01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
area agencies have difficulties with
 
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce so many of those service
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
coordinators I know are new to this
 
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
whole process as well so they've been
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
learning you know their role in entering
 
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
information into um you know their their
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
system um and so the paperwork we submit
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed that much um but it's
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
making sure that all that billing is
 
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
happening happening properly that we're
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
receiving what we are expecting to
 
01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:19.239 align:start position:0%
receive and when it's not happening
 
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out why it's not
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
happening has been what a great part of
 
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
my burden is and that's only related to
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
the billing component of this systems
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
change a big part of the systems change
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
is also our responsibility as a provider
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
because there have been many changes
 
01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
that are part of this July 1st
 
01:45:41.709 --> 01:45:41.719 align:start position:0%
transition um that has changed the
 
01:45:44.910 --> 01:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
nature of our role with the area agency
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
and with service coordinators so I have
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
to also try to make sure as an agency
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know we're following what our new
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
expectations um
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
h504 the the provider regulation um
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that we're in
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
compliance with that that we're
 
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of that um so it's not
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
solely the billing that's of course
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
what's most important to me to my board
 
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
to being able to pay my staff um not
 
01:46:16.430 --> 01:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
knowing what the rates are going to be
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
and you know the Meers and stofer work
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
um that has you know we were expecting
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
that initially July of this year and
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
then we were expecting it of January of
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
this year and now it's July of next year
 
01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
um and not having the confidence to know
 
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
whether what our rates are going to be
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
um my board has not allowed me to give
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
my staff pay raises for a year and a
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
half because we don't really know what
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
our revenues are going to be because we
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
have all of these unanswered questions s
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
um so it's that whole package that's
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
taking so much of my time not just the
 
01:46:58.589 --> 01:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
billing component although that is a a
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
fairly major component especially for a
 
01:47:01.239 --> 01:47:03.950 align:start position:0%
fairly major component especially for a
small

01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
organization thank you so much for
 
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
coming and sharing that um I I'm
 
01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
expecting that we probably will um
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
regardless of the outcome of this bill
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee of this committee to
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
sort of see what's going on and I hope
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
that you'll come and help us exp help us
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
understand the transition in your role
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can understand how the
 
01:47:23.589 --> 01:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
legislature can support the department
 
01:47:25.589 --> 01:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
and you and everybody else involved in
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
this great thank you the small providers
 
01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
in the state really need a voice and I
 
01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
will do my best to be available for it
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you yes that's one of those places
 
01:47:35.229 --> 01:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
commissions are great to get a lot of
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
people in but hearings and coming and
 
01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
speaking and not and just even those
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
work sessions where the individuals
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
involved can come and have the same
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
voice is one of the beauties of the New
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature so thank you
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%

Maine thank you so much uh Madam
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and representatives for
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak a bit today um Mr
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
Gillis who you just heard from is one of
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
my peers on the private providers
 
01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
Network which is a coalition of uh small
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
and large providers across the state of
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire some of us are like Easter
 
01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:33.320 align:start position:0%
Seals uh very large and serve the entire
 
01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
State some are relatively small like
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
manad uh work source for Great Bay
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
Services we're relatively small and we
 
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
do straddle that main New Hampshire line
 
01:48:45.790 --> 01:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
so our experiences with uh changes that
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
have been happening in Medicaid is sort
 
01:48:47.639 --> 01:48:48.629 align:start position:0%
have been happening in Medicaid is sort
of

01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
multifaceted um I also feel Duty bound
 
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
to mention my older brother is also a
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
service recipient and because of delays
 
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
wrapped up in um the
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh we found him dropped from
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid as of July 13th along with I'm
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
sure tens of thousands of other new
 
01:49:11.550 --> 01:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
hampshirites uh a process which should
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
have really taken nine months uh was
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
condensed into a very short period and
 
01:49:17.950 --> 01:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
within the span of about an hour we got
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
a phone call saying he's he's not
 
01:49:22.109 --> 01:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
covered anymore so that is also
 
01:49:25.070 --> 01:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
impacting billing so organizations uh
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
like robs like my own um there are uh
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
client families that are racing to try
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
reapproved um in in the case of my
 
01:49:38.669 --> 01:49:38.679 align:start position:0%
brother it was he retired in his 401k
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
now now makes him a wealthy
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
man so figuring out how he can still
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
receive these supports that he
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
desperately needs um I will try to uh
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
address my comments to the things that I
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
think will be most helpful to you I do
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
want to mention that uh we as an
 
01:49:56.310 --> 01:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
organization are relatively fortunate
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
and that because we do straddle two
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
states and we address various different
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
needs we do have a halftime Finance
 
01:50:06.270 --> 01:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
director a halftime billing clerk um who
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
has already been using uh mmis in the
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
state of Maine we did make the decision
 
01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh despite attending all of the sessions
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
which we're very grateful for that uh
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
BDS uh and DHHS put on for us uh that uh
 
01:50:23.229 --> 01:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
many if not most of us from PPN did
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
attend uh that it was best for us to go
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
through a third party provider uh one
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
sky was the one uh third party provider
 
01:50:33.390 --> 01:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
who uh came and spoke to PPN and spoke
 
01:50:35.709 --> 01:50:35.719 align:start position:0%
to what they would be able to do which I
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciated one sky is one of
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
the two area agencies that we had
 
01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:42.679 align:start position:0%
experience working with so we' worked
 
01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
with Mr Cordo uh in the past and felt
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
very comfortable making that transition
 
01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
that said although it's it's been a
 
01:50:51.069 --> 01:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
relatively smooth transition from that
 
01:50:53.069 --> 01:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
perspective there have been some billing
 
01:50:55.229 --> 01:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
delays I did try to put together just an
 
01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
anecdotal piece because I know that was
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
a question um Madam chairwoman that you
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously uh we do have uh
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
our first payments related to the
 
01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
beginning of July we received
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
approximately mid August um we have
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
approximately 3 weeks worth of
 
01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:13.719 align:start position:0%
receivables that are over 3 weeks past
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
due and about one week uh worth of
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
receivables uh that are greater than 60
 
01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
days P du um I do want to say that I'm
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
I'm grateful that we don't provide any
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
case management or Service Coordination
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
out of great Bas Services because it's
 
01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
my impression that a great deal of of
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
this work has fallen to them uh that
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
does generally speaking uh speak to the
 
01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
what the area agencies are going through
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh because the vast majority of uh case
 
01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
managers and service coordinators are
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
employed by the area agencies um we are
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
thrilled to be this involved in the
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
conversation about rate setting
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh we all did kind of feel a bit falling
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
off the edge of a cliff uh as of July
 
01:51:59.069 --> 01:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
1st I know that's not what anyone wanted
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
I had a bit of a feeling like all of us
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
were with our eyes closed trying to
 
01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
describe an elephant by feel uh and all
 
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
of us were paying attention to our own
 
01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
little piece and not necessarily getting
 
01:52:13.629 --> 01:52:13.639 align:start position:0%
a full picture through I I feel no fault
 
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
of of anyone's we we tried our best to
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
be prepared and I'm grateful that we
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
decided to go through a third party uh
 
01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
to to do our Medicaid billing despite
 
01:52:24.109 --> 01:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
our experience billing with Medicaid uh
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
in the state of Maine um so we did have
 
01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
that experience of falling off the cliff
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
and there is some anxiety about the
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
other shoe to fall hoping there's not
 
01:52:34.589 --> 01:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
another Cliff approaching but with that
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
said this open conversation and and our
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
involvement in it does give give me and
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
I know my peers on PPN a great deal of
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
of comfort and I I again appreciate the
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much for providing that
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
in hopefully you'll stay involved thank
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:52:54.750 --> 01:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who would like
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair and members of
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
the committee I I realize you've been
 
01:53:13.629 --> 01:53:13.639 align:start position:0%
here a long time but I will uh I'll try
 
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
to be as brief as I can Alex kbis with
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
Denny and ble representing the Community
 
01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
Support Network the association of the
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
10 a agencies I I I just want to give
 
01:53:25.390 --> 01:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
you and I really appreciate the the
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
presentation from the Department I I it
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
was um good to see that there wasn't a
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
lot of finger pointing and um blaming
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
you know the sides of the issue but you
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
know I do I do represent a lot of
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
different um employees and and families
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
who want me to have you know say certain
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
things on the record we haven't had an
 
01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity as the area agency
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
collectively to to speak to you really
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
since the hearings on these bills uh
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
back in in February and March so I just
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
want to give you a kind of a flavor for
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
how things have progressed since July
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
1st from our perspective so there is a
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
little bit uh you reflecting on the past
 
01:54:01.629 --> 01:54:01.639 align:start position:0%
but also I think there's a there's a
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
hopeful message at the end where I think
 
01:54:05.310 --> 01:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
we are making some progress particularly
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
in the last week or so to to try and
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
move this forward so uh if you'll just
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
permit me to go through some opening
 
01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
remarks here that I have
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
um so again you obviously you heard from
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
from the department for about an hour
 
01:54:22.270 --> 01:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
and we do think it's important that you
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
hear from the the provider Community as
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
well because we have a different
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
experience and we represent uh different
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
constituencies and and from the air
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
agency's perspective one one one
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
moment we did hear one week ago yes from
 
01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
the gentleman sitting next to you yes
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
you did at Great length yes you did so
 
01:54:43.709 --> 01:54:43.719 align:start position:0%
let's not have quite so much no
 
01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard yes uh thank you
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
understood representative I appreciate
 
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
that I just want to make sure you can
 
01:54:54.589 --> 01:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
just go ahead I just want to make sure
 
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
that that was noted
 
01:54:59.550 --> 01:54:59.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you very much my name
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
is m I'm the CEO for one sky um I think
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
where this testimony differs is this is
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
the collective group um and not so much
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
just from my region thank you yes and
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
and certainly on behalf of the agenes we
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate you know this it's a Friday
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
afternoon and and we appreciate you all
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
being here we all know how much you get
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
paid and it's not very much so we I I I
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
don't mean to uh imply that you haven't
 
01:55:25.629 --> 01:55:25.639 align:start position:0%
been you haven't afforded us the
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh we just haven't had as a
 
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
as a collective uh we have not been
 
01:55:32.189 --> 01:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
before you I should say is the way to uh
 
01:55:34.270 --> 01:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
explain that so from the air agency's
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
perspective uh the go live has really
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
there there's been a lot of chaos and
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
confusion frankly since July 1st and
 
01:55:44.069 --> 01:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
many of the air agency staff who have
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
worked in the system for a long time
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
have told me that they felt really
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
stressed overwhelmed hopeless uh they've
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
never experienced this level of uh
 
01:55:57.069 --> 01:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
dysfunction not able to do not able to
 
01:55:58.589 --> 01:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
perform their job that they want to do
 
01:56:00.069 --> 01:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
which is to help people and to serve the
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
community uh in addition as you heard
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
most area agencies are experiencing
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
Financial challenges uh and financial
 
01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:09.639 align:start position:0%
shortfalls and this has required the
 
01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
agencies to apply for the stabilization
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
funds uh from the Department or some of
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
them have had to rely on credit lines
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
from from Banks and other financial
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
institutions some area agencies are
 
01:56:23.229 --> 01:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
freezing hiring they're freezing wages
 
01:56:25.709 --> 01:56:25.719 align:start position:0%
they're delaying necessary and important
 
01:56:27.790 --> 01:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
projects and you these actions are the
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
result of the uh the corrective action
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
plan and the implementation uh in in
 
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.310 align:start position:0%
plan and the implementation uh in in
July

01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
July
 
01:56:37.149 --> 01:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
um this is in spite of us adopting a new
 
01:56:39.149 --> 01:56:39.159 align:start position:0%
budget that had millions of dollars in
 
01:56:41.950 --> 01:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increases so it's not you
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
know it's it's it's with a lot of
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
disappointment that I'm reporting to
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
that some air agencies are freezing
 
01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
wages I don't think any of us would have
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
thought that when we were all
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
celebrating the the state budget that we
 
01:56:54.069 --> 01:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
passed but you know that's where we are
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
and again I don't want to reiterate too
 
01:56:58.589 --> 01:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
much in the past but because I haven't
 
01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
spoke for the agencies um really since
 
01:57:03.870 --> 01:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
the the winter on this we obviously know
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
that we we had a really bad data
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
migration I mean that really is a huge
 
01:57:11.709 --> 01:57:11.719 align:start position:0%
part of this issue and again from the a
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
agency perspective we were too slow to
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the cause of the issues with
 
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
the data migration and we were too slow
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
to begin to fix it and and as you know
 
01:57:22.510 --> 01:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
the challenges that everyone's facing
 
01:57:24.149 --> 01:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
here are around billing and software
 
01:57:27.069 --> 01:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
glitches serice service authorizations
 
01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
and a lot of growing pains because the
 
01:57:31.069 --> 01:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
air agencies used to upload their client
 
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
documents into E Studio and now they
 
01:57:35.229 --> 01:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
have to upload it into New Hampshire
 
01:57:37.629 --> 01:57:37.639 align:start position:0%
easy and many of the air agencies feel
 
01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:39.679 align:start position:0%
that they weren't given the proper
 
01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
training and tools to be successful with
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
that transition and as you heard again I
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to reiterate but I just want
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
to get it on the record many of the
 
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
software problems are around bad data
 
01:57:53.709 --> 01:57:53.719 align:start position:0%
entries missing information mismatching
 
01:57:56.350 --> 01:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
names and these issues require a great
 
01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
deal of time to fix and there's not a
 
01:58:00.189 --> 01:58:00.199 align:start position:0%
lot of people in this world who can fix
 
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
these issues uh the state HHS and their
 
01:58:05.470 --> 01:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
other Consultants who run these systems
 
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that really have the
 
01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:09.560 align:start position:0%
control we can't go in and necessarily
 
01:58:11.709 --> 01:58:11.719 align:start position:0%
fix a lot of these issues as the area
 
01:58:11.719 --> 01:58:12.750 align:start position:0%
fix a lot of these issues as the area
agency

01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
So In fairness there are issues on the
 
01:58:18.910 --> 01:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
air agency side as well um as you heard
 
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
there's problems with the uh area
 
01:58:22.990 --> 01:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
agency's internal Billing System and we
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
are working to address that and we have
 
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
to own those those challenges as well um
 
01:58:29.950 --> 01:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
so I guess the bottom line here is from
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
our point of view the train is is off
 
01:58:35.109 --> 01:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
the track and we've got to get the train
 
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
back on the track and we can argue
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
should we have piloted a section of the
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
track and tested it out and you know
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's in the past it's off the track
 
01:58:47.069 --> 01:58:47.079 align:start position:0%
we've got to work to get the train back
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
on the track the train can't go back to
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
June 30 it can only move forward so we
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
all have to move forward together we
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
want to work together we don't want to
 
01:58:57.709 --> 01:58:57.719 align:start position:0%
be finger pointing we don't want to be
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
arguing with each other uh we have to
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
work as partners providers and and the
 
01:59:05.950 --> 01:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
department to try and and bring come
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
together to resolve this issue because
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people who depend on
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
that train being on the track and those
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
are the people that get the services uh
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
so to that end now I'm going to sort of
 
01:59:20.430 --> 01:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
transition to the positivity uh we did
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
have a a really productive meeting with
 
01:59:24.830 --> 01:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the the air agency leadership and
 
01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
the department leadership had a meeting
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
on Monday of this past week and we
 
01:59:31.109 --> 01:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
discussed the system transformation uh
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
pretty in depth and the are agencies
 
01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
left that meeting cautiously optimistic
 
01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
that our concerns were heard and they
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
the concerns have been I think elevated
 
01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
to a new level of uh not that they
 
01:59:43.950 --> 01:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
weren't heard before but I think there's
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
a a increased Consciousness with the
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
decision makers at the department to um
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
really get get behind some of the things
 
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
that we're saying and and to try to
 
01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
resolve some of these challenges so
 
01:59:58.750 --> 01:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
we're cautiously optimistic that uh
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
there's an elevated awareness and that
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
we have a path forward so I think those
 
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
are two really important positive uh
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
developments that have happened this
 
02:00:07.950 --> 02:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
week we went into the meeting as the
 
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
area agencies with with really a simple
 
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
ask that we we need to clean up the New
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire easy implementation and that
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
is that is the system that has all this
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
bad data from mmis as you heard from the
 
02:00:25.470 --> 02:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
gentleman from from madok uh we need to
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
stabilize cash flow and we can't be
 
02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
interrupted by any new initiatives we
 
02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
have to be focused like a laser on the
 
02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan and imple
 
02:00:36.270 --> 02:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
implementing that and getting it right
 
02:00:38.430 --> 02:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
and getting these providers on on a firm
 
02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
footing so the good news is that as you
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
heard from the Department today they uh
 
02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
they seem to be understanding the fact
 
02:00:48.589 --> 02:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
that the system is very fragile right
 
02:00:51.149 --> 02:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
now and it cannot take on uh new
 
02:00:53.229 --> 02:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives we need to get what's what
 
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
we're working on now right before we
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
move forward so specifically electronic
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
visit verification yes it's been around
 
02:01:04.510 --> 02:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
since 2016 but I mean how how much have
 
02:01:06.589 --> 02:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
we really been focused on it since 2016
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
I would argue you know not very much
 
02:01:11.069 --> 02:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
there's there's a vendor that's behind
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
right now we're hearing that it may go
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
live in March uh we we don't think that
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to be enough time to to
 
02:01:21.229 --> 02:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
resolve these issues so we would we
 
02:01:23.790 --> 02:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
would Advocate that evv be put off even
 
02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
if it does cost a little bit in fines we
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
feel that that cost is is probably
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
modest when you compare trying to layer
 
02:01:35.069 --> 02:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
on another major systems change
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
particularly a software systems change
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
which is a lot of what evv is going to
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
end up being onto the system right now
 
02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh the folks who are in the trenches at
 
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
the a agencies can't be going to more
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
meetings about some new system
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
transformation it just it it will break
 
02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
the system in my opinion uh changes to
 
02:01:55.470 --> 02:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
the financial management services so
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
this is what we're looking for and the
 
02:01:58.830 --> 02:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
department has agreed to this they
 
02:02:01.069 --> 02:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
testified to it today we need to delay
 
02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
the implementation of rate and
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
wraparound broker Services uh this has a
 
02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
significant impact as you heard on the
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
participant managed Services which is
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
basically the the services that are
 
02:02:14.109 --> 02:02:14.119 align:start position:0%
managed by a family
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
member uh we need to reconfigure the
 
02:02:18.750 --> 02:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
paybacks to match any improvements in
 
02:02:21.870 --> 02:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
the system so as we start to clean up
 
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire easy and we start to get
 
02:02:25.229 --> 02:02:25.239 align:start position:0%
more comfortable and and agencies start
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
to get paid more
 
02:02:29.470 --> 02:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
regularly then we can start looking more
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
aggressively at the payback but until
 
02:02:34.149 --> 02:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
that happens we think it's premature to
 
02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
to have that date in there now the
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
department has said that they're not
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
willing to globally uh be flexible on
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
that it's they want to look at it more
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
from an individual agency perspective uh
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
I think we would probably prefer some
 
02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
some more Global flexibility around the
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
p paybacks and then uh it's not really
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
directly related to the cap but again
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
I've been asked by by by the area
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
agencies and and the people that they
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
support and represent to talk a little
 
02:03:01.229 --> 02:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
bit about the the Medicaid rate
 
02:03:04.270 --> 02:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
increases uh we we need those
 
02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
implemented as soon as possible I don't
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
think it's going to happen before
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
January 1st technically the department
 
02:03:13.149 --> 02:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
is in compliance if they uh execute
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
those rate increases by January 1st uh I
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
think a lot of folks were hoping that
 
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
they would recognize the workforce
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
crisis and and get those out a little
 
02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
bit sooner they they technically have
 
02:03:26.350 --> 02:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
until January 1st to do it they could do
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
it earlier if they want to uh it doesn't
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
seem like that's going to
 
02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
happen uh that's their right I I just I
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
I wanted to just express our
 
02:03:36.750 --> 02:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
disappointment that they weren't able to
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
get the money on the street a little bit
 
02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:41.790 align:start position:0%
get the money on the street a little bit
sooner

02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
sooner
 
02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
um but again we've been assured that
 
02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
they will they will provide those rate
 
02:03:48.109 --> 02:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
increases by January 1st and that will
 
02:03:49.549 --> 02:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
obviously help
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh with cash flow and and with uh
 
02:03:54.669 --> 02:03:54.679 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention of
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
staff so in closing uh as I said we had
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
a good meeting on Monday we recommitted
 
02:04:04.510 --> 02:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
I think both sides to try and start a
 
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
new and look
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
forward we're going to have bi-weekly
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
meetings with with the area
 
02:04:13.629 --> 02:04:13.639 align:start position:0%
agencies and the department staff the
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
decision makers at the department to try
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
and get this back on track and uh
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
I think we left the meeting with a
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
commitment on both sides that yes things
 
02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
have been rough since July 1 but that we
 
02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
together we can work on a smoother path
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
forward to try and um to try and get the
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
system where everyone wants it to be
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
because I agree with um with Pam who
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
spoke before no no nobody wanted this to
 
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
happen obviously um but it has happened
 
02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with it as I said we
 
02:04:46.990 --> 02:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
can't we can't bring the train back to
 
02:04:48.990 --> 02:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
June 30th we just have to work together
 
02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
to try to bring the train back and you
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
know I do think there's a role for the
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
legislature to um as as we've talked
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
about holding these types of meetings
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know that legislation
 
02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
is going to really fix the problem I
 
02:05:02.669 --> 02:05:02.679 align:start position:0%
think really what's going to fix the
 
02:05:05.069 --> 02:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
problem is time it's going to take time
 
02:05:07.229 --> 02:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
to work these Kinks out with the
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
software uh there's there's not really a
 
02:05:13.149 --> 02:05:13.159 align:start position:0%
Magic Bullet but I think if we if we can
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
signal to the area agencies and the
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
provider community that we're not going
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
to layer on new requirements at the
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
moment until we we get our house in
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
order and then we can be a little more
 
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
flexible with the paybacks so the people
 
02:05:27.229 --> 02:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
can uh pay their staff and deliver the
 
02:05:28.589 --> 02:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
services I think that's going to go a
 
02:05:32.069 --> 02:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
long way towards um giving us some
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
comfort and a little bit of breathing
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
room to try to clean up this this know
 
02:05:38.910 --> 02:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a mess that we're
 
02:05:41.950 --> 02:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
in thank you representative
 
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
nichel thank you that answered a lot of
 
02:05:46.669 --> 02:05:46.679 align:start position:0%
my questions and thoughts and comments
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
and I would also add that community
 
02:05:50.669 --> 02:05:50.679 align:start position:0%
indication as part of the process too
 
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
which you've already alluded to um what
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
do you think about the concept of
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
interim study for this
 
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
bill uh I think interim study makes
 
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
sense if it as a if it's a true interim
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
study I mean I think if you're asking me
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
what is the role what can you do as the
 
02:06:08.990 --> 02:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
legislature to help solve this problem
 
02:06:11.709 --> 02:06:11.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's a great question um I think
 
02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
having meetings like this staying
 
02:06:16.510 --> 02:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
involved um frankly putting pressure on
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
the department when you think that we're
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
um we have points that are that are not
 
02:06:22.470 --> 02:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
getting through as as representative
 
02:06:24.549 --> 02:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
marchan said I mean they they do Drive
 
02:06:27.629 --> 02:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
the Bus obviously I mean uh a lot of
 
02:06:27.639 --> 02:06:28.589 align:start position:0%
the Bus obviously I mean uh a lot of
these

02:06:28.589 --> 02:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
decisions they are very collaborative we
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
we talk to them all the time but
 
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes um you need a little bit of a
 
02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
legislative push as you know I mean
 
02:06:39.390 --> 02:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
that's often times why a lot of bills
 
02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
are introduced as as most of you know um
 
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
so if you can be an advocate for your
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
constituents hold meetings like this try
 
02:06:49.069 --> 02:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
to bring both sides together together
 
02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
and and and help us um Elevate the
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
issues um as I said the meeting that you
 
02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
had the representative Weber um
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
reference I think the meeting we had on
 
02:07:02.109 --> 02:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
Monday was a result of the subcommittee
 
02:07:03.629 --> 02:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
the previous subcommittee that you had
 
02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
all of that concern that was raised by
 
02:07:07.709 --> 02:07:07.719 align:start position:0%
this committee by you hosting that
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
meeting that I think created a positive
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
action and and then that's going to
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
continue to move forward so if if the
 
02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
department knows that the legislature
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
will stay engaged I think it's just a
 
02:07:21.149 --> 02:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
little extra check that um you know that
 
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
you're watching not not that they need
 
02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
to be watched don't don't misunderstand
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
me but um it it it does help us it it
 
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
does help us to have you as advocates
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
and someone that we can um that we can
 
02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
go to with concerns and that you can try
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
to Advocate on our behalf when you think
 
02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you there other
 
02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:42.390 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you there other
representative

02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
Merchant this is actually a question
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um question for my
 
02:07:50.109 --> 02:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
steam colleague to my right ter
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
we and looking at the Department of
 
02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
Health Human Services and the oversight
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
committee is it possible to create
 
02:08:00.030 --> 02:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee of that committee without
 
02:08:01.470 --> 02:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
going through the legislative process
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get to is I think the
 
02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:05.679 align:start position:0%
communication between the all the
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
parties has been shown to be beneficial
 
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
to all um instead of going through a
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
legislative process to create something
 
02:08:13.629 --> 02:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
that could doal with the Alzheimer's
 
02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of that oversight committee
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
is it possible for the committee itself
 
02:08:20.189 --> 02:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
or the chair of that committee to
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
convene a subcommittee of different
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
parties so we don't lose momentum that
 
02:08:27.629 --> 02:08:27.639 align:start position:0%
we created um as we go through the inim
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
study so at that point in time I guess
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
my colleague to my right give her a
 
02:08:33.549 --> 02:08:33.559 align:start position:0%
chance here to speak is can we do that
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
as a oversight
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
committee Madam chair if I may reply um
 
02:08:45.310 --> 02:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
yes we can but my what I'm hearing here
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
first of all what you do is you submit
 
02:08:50.109 --> 02:08:50.119 align:start position:0%
and it's all in statute you submit a
 
02:08:52.270 --> 02:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
written request to the oversight
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
committee to establish a subcommittee
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
and you give an outline of what the
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is supposed to be doing and
 
02:09:02.549 --> 02:09:02.559 align:start position:0%
it can be voted on by the oversight
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
committee and that's one thing that
 
02:09:06.990 --> 02:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely can be done it seems to me
 
02:09:10.549 --> 02:09:10.559 align:start position:0%
that it might be more
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
effective uh to Simply make sure that as
 
02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:18.950 align:start position:0%
effective uh to Simply make sure that as
a

02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
part of the interim study
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
process that either we or an ad
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
hoc um subcommittee of the health and
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
human conservices committee which is the
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
other way you can do it meets and I
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
think we've got
 
02:09:38.910 --> 02:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
enough uh motivation between all of the
 
02:09:41.430 --> 02:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
people sitting here to keep the process
 
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.549 align:start position:0%
people sitting here to keep the process
going

02:09:42.549 --> 02:09:42.559 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
forward um that um you know I would do
 
02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
it under the intern study committee and
 
02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
keep things going that way but if there
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
was any push back with that either an ad
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
hoc committee which can simply be named
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
by our chair or a subcommittee official
 
02:10:03.310 --> 02:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of Health and Human
 
02:10:06.549 --> 02:10:06.559 align:start position:0%
Services can be implemented if if people
 
02:10:06.559 --> 02:10:08.109 align:start position:0%
Services can be implemented if if people
feel

02:10:08.109 --> 02:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
feel
 
02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
like what we hope keeps happening going
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
forward isn't happening so we've got a
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of options
 
02:10:17.790 --> 02:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
there thank you I think we've actually
 
02:10:19.709 --> 02:10:19.719 align:start position:0%
built a of knowledge here amongst the
 
02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
people here um and I think that doing it
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
within the Health and Human Services
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee would mean that we don't need
 
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
to go back to Prior ground this is such
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
a dynamic situation than moving forward
 
02:10:32.109 --> 02:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee of Health and Human
 
02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
Services um and then moving towards
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
interim study would probably be most
 
02:10:37.390 --> 02:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
helpful so I I saw another hand that
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
there may be somebody else who wants to
 
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
speak with us um I I don't see any other
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
qu questions for these gentlemen thank
 
02:10:43.950 --> 02:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
you so much for everything that you
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
brought forward this is one of those
 
02:10:48.069 --> 02:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
that brings us the do the information
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
and and I do know that we have people
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
that do have some other appointments but
 
02:10:51.629 --> 02:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
also we want to also U make sure that
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear I think one last
 
02:11:03.470 --> 02:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:07.149 --> 02:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
hands good afternoon thank you so much I
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to take up too much time for
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Lisa Bodwin I'm a
 
02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
disability and Health Care policy
 
02:11:16.750 --> 02:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
consultant and a former executive
 
02:11:18.750 --> 02:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
director of a nonprofit here in New
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that advocates for people with
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
disabilities so I have a a a long
 
02:11:27.069 --> 02:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
history of being on the team um and I'm
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
here today wearing my hat as a family
 
02:11:31.549 --> 02:11:31.559 align:start position:0%
member and that voice you haven't heard
 
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
from today and I don't think you heard
 
02:11:36.430 --> 02:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
from that Voice last week
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
so I would like to say that the
 
02:11:42.549 --> 02:11:42.559 align:start position:0%
department has worked really hard at all
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
stages of this the staff and the
 
02:11:47.189 --> 02:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
department are really dedicated to
 
02:11:50.990 --> 02:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
trying to make the DD system a more
 
02:11:53.790 --> 02:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
robust system so that people with
 
02:11:55.709 --> 02:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities can have incredibly
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
inclusive lives there is no doubt that
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
everyone in the department is working
 
02:12:03.229 --> 02:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
really incredibly hard um and that a lot
 
02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
of collaboration has happened so that
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
has to be said
 
02:12:12.910 --> 02:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
um anecdotally I am hearing from
 
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
families that service coordinators are
 
02:12:19.310 --> 02:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
so overwhelmed by the new responsibility
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
is that they're leaving their jobs and
 
02:12:24.750 --> 02:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
there'll be data on that in the next six
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
weeks or so I also want to remind the
 
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
committee that families in New Hampshire
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
are in fact the backbone of the DD
 
02:12:35.790 --> 02:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
system um we have a severe housing
 
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
shortage and we have a severe Workforce
 
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
shortage so much of what um happens to
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
support individuals who are adults with
 
02:12:48.510 --> 02:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities happens on on
 
02:12:50.830 --> 02:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
the backs of families and family members
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
um give U thousands tens of thousands of
 
02:12:57.310 --> 02:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
dollars of free labor to support their
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
adult individuals who they are not
 
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
legally responsible to house or um
 
02:13:07.669 --> 02:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
become dsps for which there are many
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
brothers sisters Aunts Uncles and even
 
02:13:13.270 --> 02:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
parents who are now having to be paid as
 
02:13:16.549 --> 02:13:16.559 align:start position:0%
a DSP um because the workforce shortage
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:22.589 --> 02:13:22.599 align:start position:0%
uh getting the rates up and going would
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
go a long way toward strengthening the
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
workforce to help alleviate some of the
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
stress on the families and we really
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that service
 
02:13:33.310 --> 02:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
coordinators um are getting what they
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
need um because we cannot have the the
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
impacts to the service providers and the
 
02:13:44.549 --> 02:13:44.559 align:start position:0%
way that service providers are having to
 
02:13:47.149 --> 02:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
Bank in weekend hours to deal with
 
02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
billing great setting prior
 
02:13:53.229 --> 02:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
authorizations um we can't have those
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
staff leaving because then families will
 
02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:58.109 align:start position:0%
staff leaving because then families will
start

02:13:58.109 --> 02:13:58.119 align:start position:0%
start
 
02:14:01.310 --> 02:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
feeling the systemic change which is
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately supposed to be supporting
 
02:14:05.470 --> 02:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
individuals to have more robust
 
02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:06.950 align:start position:0%
individuals to have more robust
community-based

02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
community-based
 
02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:09.549 align:start position:0%
community-based
lives

02:14:09.549 --> 02:14:09.559 align:start position:0%
lives
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
um that's those are my notes I
 
02:14:16.109 --> 02:14:16.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time uh today and I know
 
02:14:18.109 --> 02:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
that everyone is working really hard to
 
02:14:21.790 --> 02:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
collaborate on the ultimate goal which
 
02:14:25.229 --> 02:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
is um a world where people with
 
02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities are embraced have a feeling
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
of belonging have access to work have
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
access to Rotary clubs
 
02:14:37.510 --> 02:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
voting um and the Appalachian Mountain
 
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
Club equally to their peers without
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities so let's keep staying
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
focused that this is really about the
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
the people thank you thank you and thank
 
02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:50.559 align:start position:0%

really appreciate you being here and for
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
everything you do um I I think we've
 
02:14:56.430 --> 02:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
seen just how important this is and how
 
02:14:57.910 --> 02:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
important it is to keep moving forward
 
02:15:00.189 --> 02:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
and doing this in the New Hampshire way
 
02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
um with that I would be willing to
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
motion okay I I would move interim study
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
608 uh with a committee report that
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
includes Our intention to work on the
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
bill going forward to work on not the
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
bill but the global situation going
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
forward um so that everybody is still in

touch and so that people have this as a
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
