agency that supervises a wide variety of
 
00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 align:start position:0%
financial instit institions we
 
00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 align:start position:0%

to New Hampshire
 
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
citizens uh the banking department for
 
00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
the purposes of the budget is structured
 
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
into two uh divisions or buckets I
 
00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes use those words
 
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
interchangeably that is what I mean when
 
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
I say that the first one of the the
 
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
first division is the banking trust
 
00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 align:start position:0%
division that oversees the activities of
 
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
16 State chartered Banks seven credit
 
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
unions and 45 non-depository trust
 
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
companies the other bucket is the
 
00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 align:start position:0%
consumer credit Division and that
 
00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 align:start position:0%
supervises the activities of over 7,000
 
00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
uh lenses those are companies that are
 
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 align:start position:0%

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 align:start position:0%
the licenses under our
 
00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction uh the banking department
 
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
is a self-funded agency we take no
 
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
General funds how that works is at the
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
start of every fiscal year we receive an
 
00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the legislature or
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget and then over the
 
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
course of the fiscal year we collect
 
00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 align:start position:0%
fees and fines and apply those towards
 
00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:22.789 align:start position:0%
fees and fines and apply those towards
the

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation at the end of the fiscal
 
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
year any shortfall between the initial
 
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation and the fees and finds
 
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
collected is um brought into the
 
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
department through an assessment um on
 
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
our licensed and chartered entities if
 
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
required um and that is that fully
 
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation so into our the meat of
 
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
our budget proposal um the banking
 
00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 align:start position:0%
department is approximately the banking
 
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
Department's budget is approximately
 
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
86% salaries and benefits we're all
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
people we don't have a lot of things um
 
00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 align:start position:0%
that need budgeting um we are 50 we have
 
00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
53 positions all of those positions will
 
00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
be filled on March
 
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
21st uh we have no unfunded positions no
 
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
vacant positions as of March
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
21st so when we prepare did you in
 
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 uh I mean occasionally
 
00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 align:start position:0%
we'd get one because of attrition sure
 
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
but no I mean other than like somebody
 
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
say they moved to a different job we
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
immediately fill it thank you
 
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
yep um
 
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
when we developed our budget proposal we
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
looked out on the landscape of what we
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
have to deal with and these are these
 
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
are some of the things I'm going to list
 
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
are some of the things that we noticed
 
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
and took into account When developing
 
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
our budget um New Hampshire continues to
 
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
experience growth in the trust
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
industry um as of today we have 45 by
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the fiscal year we're
 
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
projected to have at least 46 trust
 
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
companies chartered by us those trust
 
00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 align:start position:0%
companies have nearly $2 trillion doll
 
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
in assets under
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
Administration that makes new trust
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
companies charred in New Hampshire were
 
00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
the third largest for that group out of
 
00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
all the states so even though we're tiny
 
00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
little New Hampshire we have a lot of
 
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility and a lot of assets under
 
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.469 align:start position:0%
responsibility and a lot of assets under
our

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
supervision another thing that when you
 
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
look out at the landscape and see um
 
00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
there's an in a notable increase in the
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
last several years and anticipated into
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
the future of fintech
 
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
supervision so one of the entities that
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
we license are money transmitters
 
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
traditionally you would think of those
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
like Western Union somebody who takes
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
money from one person gives it to
 
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
another howo however in the Modern Age
 
00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 align:start position:0%
it's venmo it's PayPal we license Apple
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
pay we license Amazon um these are all
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
large companies that we have to send our
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
examiners into the field because oh by
 
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
the way most of these large companies
 
00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
want our examiners in their office doing
 
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
the examination so we have to have
 
00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 align:start position:0%
highly trained staff that can go out and
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
understand those Tech driven business
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
models and provide adequate protection
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire consumers so in a case
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
of something like Apple pay are they
 
00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
just in California and licensed in
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
California and you don't do anything or
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
or they have offices all over the place
 
00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
or it doesn't matter where they have
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
offices so it doesn't matter where they
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
have offices their headquarters I
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
believe I don't want to say wrong I
 
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
don't specifically know if Apple pay is
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
in California but let's say they are in
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
a California I would assume they
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
reasonably are they would have
 
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
headquarters there we in most instances
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
would send exam staff there to license
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
them they're licens in all 50 states in
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
most instances um last year last
 
00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
legislative cycle we did pass the money
 
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
transmitter model act which is a Act
 
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
passed by all 50 states to facilitate um
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
business-friendly licensure of companies
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
like that so all the states kind of work
 
00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879 align:start position:0%
together when we have so there's no
 
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
federal license of this no no all right
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
thank you keep going yep okay um so with
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
both the Trust Company the increase in
 
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
the trust companies and increasing
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
fintech industry regulation it requires
 
00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 align:start position:0%
the department to recruit and retain
 
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
adequate experience in professional
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
staff who can travel into the field and
 
00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 align:start position:0%
supervise those entities and really go
 
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 align:start position:0%
toe-to-toe with them and understand what
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
their business model is and what they're
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
doing and how make sure they're
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
following the laws and rules and
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
regulations additionally um last last
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
year in the legislative cycle we there
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
was a legislative change put into place
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
um at the request of the banking
 
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
Department working with industry um to
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
that effectively requires us to examine
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
auto dealers who take Finance
 
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
applications we always had the authority
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
to examine them but it was more
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
complaint-based and now um with the
 
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
supportive industry we're going to be
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
going in and examining all of them on a
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
regular basis and that resulted in um
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
300 additional exams that my staff has
 
00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
to do over the course of two the next
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
two uh fiscal years um to put that in
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
perspective last fiscal year and fiscal
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
year 24 we did about 370 exams so it's
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
requirement so that's kind of what the
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
landscape looks like for us at the
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
banking Department um so to get to the
 
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
nree of our actual proposal um we were
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
directed to Flat fund based on 20 25
 
00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:31.879 align:start position:0%
numbers but we were permitted to
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
increase travel and training
 
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
lines first I'll talk about travel um
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
when we send examiners on site The
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
Entity that we're examining fully
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
reimbursed the department for those
 
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
costs before the pandemic we used to go
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
on site all the time for almost
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
everything the pandemic happened we went
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
on site for nothing um now as we're
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic and trying to
 
00:08:59.069 --> 00:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
continue on with our efficiencies that
 
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
we learned during the pandemic but also
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
do an adequate job of accomplishing our
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
mission um we've learned that it's okay
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
to do some off-site work but there are
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
certain parts of the exam that it makes
 
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
more site to go on site for more sense
 
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
to go on site for um there's Parts where
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
the company wants us to go on site the
 
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
most frequent requests I get and um if
 
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
you want to call it a complaint they UND
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
they're very understanding I don't know
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
if it rises the level of complaint but
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
companies want our examiners to go on
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
site to them and when I tell them that I
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
can't send them because of the budget
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
they're like why we pay for it and then
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
I have to explain the whole
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
appropriation and the reimbursement and
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
all of that and then they understand but
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
I that's the most common thing that I've
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
been having to deal with is telling
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
entities under our jurisdiction no I
 
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
cannot send examiners on site to your
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
company to conduct the
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
exam so that's travel and then training
 
00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
obviously with all these large fintech
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
compan compies a huge um complex trust
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
industry um to complete um the mission
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
of the department and meet those growing
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
demands um I need to be able to train my
 
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
staff to go in and understand their
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
business models as I've talked about
 
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
additionally at the banking Department
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
much like I'm sure most state agencies
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
we're very lucky or at least I consider
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
myself very lucky at the banking
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
Department I have a lot of really
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
seasoned experienced staff I have one
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
staff member who's been at the banking
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
department for 30 years probably half of
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
the staff have been state employees and
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
most of them at the banking department
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
for 20 plus years and then there's
 
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:40.519 align:start position:0%
people like me I've been there for 13
 
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
years so we are very well experienced
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
but the flip side of that is a lot of
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
people could retire at any moment and so
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
I have to have the I have to be prepared
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
to send my new staff to training to get
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
them up to speed to replace that wealth
 
00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
of knowledge that would leave when my if
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
a if a staff a highly experienced staff
 
00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:00.949 align:start position:0%
a if a staff a highly experienced staff
member

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
retired so that's the travel and the
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
training um and then with regard to the
 
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
flat funding the rest of that that part
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
of it how we accomplished that um first
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
we sought internal efficiencies the last
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
time we redid our lease at the banking
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
Department we reduced our square footage
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
and we've gone paperless that's mostly
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
how we reduced our square footage
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
because we don't need the storage space
 
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
for all the paper um so that decreased
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
our rent a little bit made us be more
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
efficient because we don't we're
 
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.470 align:start position:0%
efficient because we don't we're
paperless

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
paperless
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
um the other another example of how we
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
sought internal efficiencies was to um
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
take administrative positions and
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
convert them into examiner positions so
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
for example the commissioner used to
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
have an executive assistant assigned to
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
her and I don't need an executive
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
assistant I can do my own scheduling um
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
so we took that position and converted
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
into an exam position so now that person
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
can go out in the field they can also
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
bill for their time as an examiner
 
00:11:59.629 --> 00:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
that's part of how we collect capture
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
our our uh fees and fines Etc um we also
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
had a team of Licensing staff that only
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
did licensing and we took those
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
positions and converted them to
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
examiners and then we took the licensing
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
tasks and distributed them amongst the
 
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
full team of examiners and we gained a
 
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
lot of efficiencies by doing that and
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's how we were able to absorb the
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
300 extra exams over the course of two
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
years without any additional positions
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
so regarding that one would it help if
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
we Chang two years to three
 
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
years two years to three no we've got a
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
plan for it I feel pretty confident
 
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
about it I don't with the positions I
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
have I can do it because we really
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
talked about that in the last
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
legislative cycle and sus that all out
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
as part of that I see yep okay so I
 
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
thank you though um so those were kind
 
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
of some of the internal efficiencies
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
that we looked at and then oh sorry go
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
ah okay yeah um and then um we also
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
reviewed external costs if you will um
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
so we were paying for an entire position
 
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
a full-time position at the Department
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
of Justice however we were really only
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
using it for a few hours every fiscal
 
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
year so we worked with the Department of
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
Justice to unfund that I don't think
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
they actually unfunded the position but
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
our funding of it they they changed
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
their funding so we don't pay for it
 
00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
anymore is that what I see on page 292
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
25 probably 49 yes 49 yep and you can
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
see we only paid maybe a th000 or 2,000
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
bucks in fiscal year 24 and but in 25 we
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
had to budget for the full position but
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
we probably won't spend all of that so
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
actually I know we won't spend all of
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
that okay so that's how that's like how
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
we gain the efficiency to um be able to
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
Flat Fund in The
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
20627 Proposal thank you yep
 
00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:03.759 align:start position:0%
my page um and then another example of
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
looking at um external costs um we have
 
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
a project underway to move to modernize
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
our um Data Systems at the department
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
we're moving out of kind of database
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
driven systems and into a SharePoint
 
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
system um that SharePoint system is
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
being designed by us at the banking
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
Department um and so it and once it's
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
maintained and we've we our goal is to
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
shut down make readon our dat bases
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
effective April 1st um once that
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully that'll go as planned and once
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
that happens we will we we feel
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
confident that we'll be able to defund
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
one of our two doit positions that are
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
embedded with us the database
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
administrator position so by defunding
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
that position defunding the doj position
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
that enabled us to Flat fund everything
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
but the travel and
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
training and that's really how we did it
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to go through more detail
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
dets about anything if you need have
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
questions um and thank you for hearing
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
me out thank you uh representative
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you Mr
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
chair um I see the increase is roughly a
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars and I know I know that's
 
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
funded by Revenue you charge your users
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering how much of that
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
increase is going to new users versus
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
previously existing uses so you mean
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
like lenses and chartered
 
00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:37.959 align:start position:0%
entities oh sorry oh the fees basically
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
are going up by a million dollars right
 
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
no so our fees are remaining the same um
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
the increas is really due to our staff
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
the normal step increases and um that
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
sort of thing that's designated by the
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
contract so you're saying that basically
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
most of the increase in revenue is going
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
to New Uses right or increased
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
uses I I guess I'm not fully we don't
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
have more we are increasing lenses and I
 
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:08.839 align:start position:0%
provide a chart on the back of us that
 
00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759 align:start position:0%
shows our kind of steady increase
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
particularly in the trust companies but
 
00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
there's not it's not a one for one um
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
situation like somehow our services let
 
00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:22.519 align:start position:0%
me ask it this one yeah what what's the
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
increase going to be for a typical Bank
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh probably very little because the the
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
banks would pay the assessment at the
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
end and thank you yeah perhaps a tiny
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
bit for increased salary costs for our
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
people because we build their time yeah
 
00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:42.389 align:start position:0%
people because we build their time yeah
other

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing too much here
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
um so so I think what you what you're
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
tell representative Griffin was sort of
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
what I was going to ask that
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
um in what the existing um banks are
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
paying you you're not changing fees
 
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:05.799 align:start position:0%
you're not changing uh so on how much is
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
fees and how much is uh
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
fines um I'd have to look and get back
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
to you it sort of varies so we also have
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
the two buckets recall so the chartered
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
entities are the trust companies credit
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
unions and Banks they get very little
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
fines almost no fines what they get what
 
00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:28.039 align:start position:0%
they pay is examination costs and then
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
an assessment at the end of the year the
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
assessment is based on asset size the
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
trust companies pay I think 90% 85 90%
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
of the assessment because they're so big
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
um per the back of the chart um so
 
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
that's the bank's Credit Unions trust
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
companies are you saying an entity that
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
was two billion would have twice the fee
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
of one that's 1 billion it's not quite
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
that simple but yes give or take well
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
and it's so the fees that they pay for
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
certain things is the same but when
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
comes to the assessment that's when the
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
amount that they have so they pay 25,000
 
00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:10.039 align:start position:0%
for an examination regardless of size or
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
not quite but give or take depending on
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
how long the exam takes it's by the hour
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
and then so much per asset yeah I see
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and the asset if you if
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
you really want to geek out and go look
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
at it it's by Statute in RSA 383 11 I
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
want to say it is 11 11 um and it shows
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
the tit ation of how it's sort of um
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's by assets and it shows that
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
titration of what they pay for the
 
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.630 align:start position:0%
titration of what they pay for the
assessment

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
okay do you want me to talk about the
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
CCD fines because the CCD yeah tell me
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
about fines
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
because right now you're you're mix
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
you're mixing fines with fees right yeah
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
they all go into one rep like we don't
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
so we actually separate them out when we
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
transmit them to das there's buckets
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
with there's like one big but within
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
that we categorize them so I could
 
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
probably run you an exact report but I
 
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
would want to get it to you after just
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
to give you the exact numbers in the
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
sense that you're spending the
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
fs it's part of your budget yeah yeah
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
the revenue the revenue yes that's how
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
we so it's it's in my mind a little um
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
distasteful for agencies to raise money
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
for themselves in that sense right I
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
mean so like you could decide to find
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
somebody more in order to get more money
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
for yourself no well so we take
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions when there's
 
00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
violations of law I'm an attorney
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
there's ethical concerns if I'm taking
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
actions just to raise money um I would
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
that would be an ethical violation for
 
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
me I would lose my bar license I don't
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
want to do that so is there how much
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
decision- making do you have in terms of
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
do you find somebody
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
,000 or $10,000 or something it's set by
 
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
Statute our fines are set by Statute um
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
each consumer because we're going to
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
talk mostly about CCD entities there's
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
each statute that governs CCD entities
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
outlines the legislature sets the feap
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
or the fine cap for me so it's generally
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
$2,500 per violation can be the maximum
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
but you can go look at our website all
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
the enforcement orders are public and
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
you can kind of get a sense of what we
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
normally find people um it depends on
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's a knowing violation a
 
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
negligent violation there's all sorts of
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
factors we take into account did they
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
self-identify it and try to fix it all
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
those things go into account when we do
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
an enforcement
 
00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
action and this
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
$2,500 hasn't changed in a long time it
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't not since I've been at the
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
banking Department which is 13 years
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
okay and I started as an enforcement
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
attorney I see okay
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
um is it enough to
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
um encourage good behavior or is it I
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
believe it is I feel confident about it
 
00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:06.919 align:start position:0%
I feel okay about it so you're not
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
recommending that we would increase it I
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
would not okay all right go ahead
 
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.190 align:start position:0%
would not okay all right go ahead
anything

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
else representative wer we see
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
Christina it's based on how we collect
 
00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
our Revenue so our assessment that we do
 
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
is 08 so anything that we collect for an
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
assessment is an ' 08 anything that we
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
collect for a fee or a fine is an
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
09 and that's broken out by 2046 which
 
00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
is our Banking and Trust and 2043 which
 
00:21:53.559 --> 00:21:57.190 align:start position:0%
is our Banking and Trust and 2043 which
is

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
CCD all right
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
no so would representative um eil like
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
to make a motion yes I'd like to make a
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
motion that we accept the banking
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
Department's uh budget proposal as
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
presented in hq1 I will second that
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
motion okay um any discussion no no okay
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh show
 
00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:26.919 align:start position:0%
F all right thank you very much thank
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:27.430 align:start position:0%

10:30 um we've been cautioned to make
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
sure when we speak our our red light is
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
on okay so we will um welcome the
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
energy and he starts on page
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
319 but maybe we'll we'll start on
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
339 just to see the bottom line to get
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
GRE all right welcome commissioner
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
chin good morning uh thank you Mr
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee my
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
name is Jared chakin I'm the
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and I'm joined this
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
morning by our chief of operations Lenny
 
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
radio um I can give some brief
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
background remarks or we can just jump
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
right in so um yeah we have a fair
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
amount of time if you have any kind of
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
small uh overview of what's going on
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
financially that might be good oh you
 
00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:05.559 align:start position:0%
you you handed something
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
out all right so let's
 
00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh yeah yeah let's start with this fuel
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
assistance because it's going you're
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
there losing on fuel yes I'll have Lenny
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
take that one first so if you're looking
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
at the um the fy2 24 actuals in
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
comparison to what we're budgeting now
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's because um in fy2 24 we had
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
remaining arpa funds and cares act funds
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
and everything else that was that's um
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
um supplemented that that program so
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
those have those have gone away um and
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
this is um just a result of what we what
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
we anticipate um having for those um
 
00:32:46.279 --> 00:32:49.110 align:start position:0%
we anticipate um having for those um
future

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
years so we're just being a little bit
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
less generous I guess is the that the
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
idea yes we're well we're we're we're uh
 
00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:00.039 align:start position:0%
we're not being able to use those um
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
excess supplemental funds so um this is
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
on page 325 by the way what we're
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
talking about just to so everybody can
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
be on the same page but this this is a
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
federal program it's a federal program
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's they're
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
losing uh they had spent in fiscal year
 
00:33:18.519 --> 00:33:20.990 align:start position:0%
losing uh they had spent in fiscal year
24

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
24
 
00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
37.7 uh million but they're expecting
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
more like 30 so it's about a sixth of
 
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.149 align:start position:0%
more like 30 so it's about a sixth of
the

00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:30.830 align:start position:0%
the
program

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
less if you see right in the middle of
 
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
the page
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
then okay but you're saying that wasn't
 
00:33:39.389 --> 00:33:39.399 align:start position:0%
really the basics from the federal
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
government those
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
were no the 30 million is more in line
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
with what we see um on a typical fiscal
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
year C all right um good all right let's
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
so weatherization um so weatherization
 
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
typically um that that Grant is around
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
$2 million per year um and we weatherize
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
about 140 homes on average right in
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
program you have a a big list of waiting
 
00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:22.839 align:start position:0%
people waiting for this weatherization
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
typically has a waiting list um New
 
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a very old housing stock um
 
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
so there are many many homes that um
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
need weatherization Services um and so
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
it's with this grant we do the best we
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
can um but there typically is a waiting
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
list for this program unlike Li Heep
 
00:34:42.669 --> 00:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
which we've not had a a waiting list in
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
years could you restructure the program
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
so that there was twice as many serve
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
for half as much each or something like
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
that well that so it's difficult because
 
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
the federal government um essentially uh
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
the the program requirements the
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines are all set out by uh by the
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
federal government there's a a
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
requirement to uh keep the price at a
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
certain cost per unit um so okay not a
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
lot of room for creativity there thank
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
you representative evil thank you um
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
this may apply to other programs as well
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
but how does the federal government
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
determine how much grant money you get
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
like for
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
this uh that's a great question I'm
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
trying to recall off the top of my head
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
for weatherization um I don't know I
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
you and maybe when you when you bring up
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
a program like this you could point to
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
it in the in the house build one that
 
00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:53.990 align:start position:0%
it in the in the house build one that
would

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.950 --> 00:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so if I recall
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
reading through the budget uh there's
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
going to be a trans for Reggie funds
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
like $10 million could you tell us the
 
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
impact that will have um it's actually
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
not Reggie funds it's the renewable
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
energy fund yeah sure which is funded
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
through um alternative compliance
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
payments to the RPS um so uh we believe
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
that um you know that that transfer uh
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
even with that transfer we can continue
 
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
to fund the staff um and continue to um
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
implement the programs for uh this
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh and of course new Revenue
 
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
will be in for the next fiscal year so
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
we believe we can continue to um uh
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
essentially carry out our statutory
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
obligations um with the funding that
 
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.670 align:start position:0%
obligations um with the funding that
will

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
remain so what kind of an impact will
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
that have obviously $10 million less is
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
going to have an impact it it will can
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
we be directed to a certain page to talk
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
about this let's
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
see it's page it's page 71 of House Bill
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
2 it's not a budgeted accounting unit oh
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
I see okay yeah we're going to get the
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
house built to next
 
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
week so maybe that would be a good time
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
to wait yeah was just there was there
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
was a line in here but I'll find it s
 
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
ianes yeah sorry I don't know if we want
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
to jump ahead to that but I mean I'm
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
interested in where in hb1 the RFS are
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
could you just tell us where it is it's
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
a continually appropriate non-lps
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
accounting unit so it's not in the um
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
bional budget it's a dedicated fund
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
which we report to the dedicated fund
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
committee and do you have do you have
 
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
information on how much is in the fund
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
now yes yes ma'am we do okay I mean is
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
maybe it's here maybe we're jumping
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
ahead but I'd be it's not in the budget
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
it's do you have something here no not
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
it's okay I'd be interested in the total
 
00:37:59.390 --> 00:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
amount of funds okay we can get you that
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
information we can do that is it quite a
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
roughly it depends on what your um like
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
what number you want do you want the
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
number that's currently sitting in the
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
fund or the number that um we've
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
budgeted for the the year so currently
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
sitting in the fund um it leaves about
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
uh 12 million that um we have left to
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
spend and then if you subtract this 10
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
million it would leave about 2 million
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
okay and under what circumstances do you
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
make decisions on to spend it I mean
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
have you been spending it down in the
 
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
way that it's supposed to be
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
or we have been and I will say that the
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
legislature has proposed um changes over
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
the last couple years there was a bill
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 303 uh that did make changes
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
for instance it eliminated the uh the
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
residential solar rebate uh which was a
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
$1,000 rebate um and that was I believe
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
had bipartisan support um and we were
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
tasked with using those funds um or
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
creating a process for those funds
 
00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
whereas they would promote um Solar
 
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
Development in a different way um so
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
we're currently in the process of uh
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
creating a proposal that will go out for
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
public comment very soon um where those
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
funds in particular uh will be uh
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
repurposed for uh Municipal I should say
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions um that are
 
00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.990 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions um that are
pursuing

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
pursuing
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh solar for their communities so we'll
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
have a a new proposal for that so even
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
though um so that's just an example of a
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
change that was made um to the program
 
00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.630 align:start position:0%
change that was made um to the program
uh

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
recently so so why don't let's let's
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
wait until next week when we talk about
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 and I'll make copies of the
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
page on the dedicated fund so everybody
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
can see what's in it as of the last
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
report and and what's been change how
 
00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079 align:start position:0%
it's changed over the years how's that
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
that I mean thank you Mr chair I would
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
just say I'm just going to express uh
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
some concern that funding that was uh
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
generated in a very specific way um to
 
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
put into this dedicated fund to be used
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
in a very specific way is um under hb2
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
would be removed and put into the
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
general fund and I guess my other
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
observation would be that if you have
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds that can be re rated
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
what is the point of them and I also
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
wonder about the
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
constitutionality so just to um express
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
my concerns about the proposal in hb2
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
upfront so we can talk about it some
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
more when you come sure representative I
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
I would just also mention that it had in
 
00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:45.079 align:start position:0%
the past um funds have been taken from
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
the RF for purposes not related to
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
energy uh for instance I believe in 2014
 
00:40:50.839 --> 00:40:51.550 align:start position:0%
energy uh for instance I believe in 2014
or

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
2015 um Governor Hassen I believe in her
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
budget or may have been a standalone
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
00:40:59.950 --> 00:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
removed uh more than a million dollars
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
to assist the um Community Action Agency
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
Tri County um they were facing serious
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
Financial uh issues um and they were
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
given RF funds to essentially help them
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
get back on their feet so it has been
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
done in the past just just so everyone
 
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.829 align:start position:0%
done in the past just just so everyone
knows

00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
knows
 
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
that thank you represent LE so is it
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
your plan not to discuss any of the
 
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
house bill two items dealing with the
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
Department of energy today yes since we
 
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
don't have hopefully Friday we'll have
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
the real thing okay there there's a
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
section and what we do have in house
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill to but I guess we'll wait until
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
Friday yeah because I think there's
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
plenty in house bille one that we can
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
talk about right I don't know got plenty
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
of time but we gotta let's wait till the
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
end okay if there's still time yeah okay
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
ahead the state energy program sure so
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
the state energy program it's 100%
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
Federal uh funding um this essentially
 
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
funds our um policy work at at the
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
department um as I'm sure most of you
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
are aware we uh our department is tasked
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
with um creating the 10year state energy
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
strategy which we are up for a revision
 
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
this year um so projects such as that
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
are funded through um State energy
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
program funds uh also for several years
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
um we have entered into a memorandum of
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
agreement with the Department of
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
ministrative Services and we have
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
provided them with federal funds to um
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh conduct Energy Efficiency upgrades in
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
state buildings um for instance uh we
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
did a lighting project at a department
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
of safety facility uh those sorts of
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
projects um many states use this funding
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
almost entirely for staff um we've tried
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
um our best to um find opportunities for
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
the funding Beyond uh Staffing um so
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
that just an example on page
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
322 3 counting unit
 
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:11.230 align:start position:0%
322 3 counting unit
3352

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.829 align:start position:0%
 
322

00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
322
 
00:43:13.839 --> 00:43:15.549 align:start position:0%
322
um

00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
3352 yes I see
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
yes uh I was going to ask on this page
 
00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
on on page
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
323 what's contracts for program
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
services going away what's that so in
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
the past um that was done for what we um
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
for uh School Energy Efficiency um
 
00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
projects um we have a different source
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
of funding uh a state energy um program
 
00:43:46.549 --> 00:43:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh from the bipartison infrastructure
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
law and we're using those funds to fund
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
these so we reduce that amount and the
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
remaining amount is going to das like
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
the commissioner just stated on um
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:04.839 align:start position:0%
state so if you'll see class 85 Federal
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
transfers to other agencies um that that
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
increased quite
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
see okay so this is what you just said I
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
mean this is uh improving state
 
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
buildings yeah that's correct yeah and
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
there's also a big in increase in
 
00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
indirect costs what's that
 
00:44:30.549 --> 00:44:30.559 align:start position:0%
so we have a um federally approved
 
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
indirect cost rate um be because when we
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
became the department of energy it was
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
kind of delayed through our cognizant
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
agency is Department of um Health and
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
Human Services because that's where we
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
get most of our funding so there was a
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
delay in them approving it so we were at
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
the DI Minimus rate for previous year at
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
which is 10% and now we've um after
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
calculations were done and it was
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
approved the indirect cost rate is
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
25.1% so that that had to go up gotcha
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay and also oit is going up
 
00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
significant that is based on we we um
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
previously only had one position
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted in here and now there's two and
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
we we uh do costs by person so um
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
increased do doit cost for the extra
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
person and why is the extra person
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
necessary it's um it it's not really a
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
an extra person it's just there was a
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
there was a funding shift we did a um
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
what we call a a kind of like a a
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
reshuffling of personnel within the
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
department which was given to us by um
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
when the department was created we had
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
that ability to go to the um uh governor
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
and councel and that was just a result
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
of the shift of um personnel and and
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
things that everybody was doing um for
 
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
more efficiencies in the department and
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
that's that um person was ended up being
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
funded by this um this uh Federal
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
program I see
 
00:46:01.549 --> 00:46:01.559 align:start position:0%
all right let's move on Heating Oil and
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
Propane sure so uh the shop program it's
 
00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
a data collection program that provides
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
fuel information um from the Energy
 
00:46:12.549 --> 00:46:12.559 align:start position:0%
Information Administration at the US
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
Department of of energy it benefits
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
consumers by providing uh reliable and
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
accurate energy uh prices for New
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumers um we update uh
 
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
during the winter time those prices are
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
updated um on a weekly basis basis uh on
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
information p and that that program is
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
so small that it's mixed in with um
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
other accounting units so that um that's
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
also in uh 3352 for 24 and 25 and it
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
just recently moved to a different
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
accounting unit for which will be for
 
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
well for part of the 25 but the rest
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
will be um be going to uh the
 
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement division in uh counting unit
 
00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:03.829 align:start position:0%
enforcement division in uh counting unit
1888

00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
okay okay next pipeline hazardous
 
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
another small one yes so um the
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy our enforcement
 
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:14.559 align:start position:0%
division um receives an annual Grant
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
from the US Department of Transportation
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
fimsa uh to oversee construction
 
00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
operations and safety practices of
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
natural and propane gas systems within
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
the state so we have two Gas
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
Distribution utilities um Unitil and
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
Liberty and we have about 900
 
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional uh propane uh systems so
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
we have inspectors that go out and do uh
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
inspections on these systems um uh to
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
ensure uh compliance with uh safety uh
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
standards and regulations um also in
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
included in this would be what is
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
commonly known as Dig Safe um so when
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
there are Dig Safe violations uh our
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
inspectors go out um to um investigate
 
00:47:59.309 --> 00:47:59.319 align:start position:0%
those situations um so we also conduct
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
training for Escavating companies and
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
utilities around Dig Safe um so that's
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
327 starting at the bottom of the page
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
1888 is the accounting
 
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.150 align:start position:0%
1888 is the accounting
unit

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.710 align:start position:0%
unit
enforcement

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay so this is also gaining a
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
person so there was a um a movement
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
between this accounting unit and
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
3357 we have certain people that are are
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
budgeted certain percentages and in the
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
past if there was any funding from the
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
assessment they would be in a different
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
accounting unit but since the person is
 
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
budgeted 75% from this program I move
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
that person into this program instead to
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:52.839 align:start position:0%
easier and what's inter agency
 
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
transfers that is a transfer because
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
people are budgeted 75 25 some some 10
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
and 90 um I have to transfer the
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
different funding sources from one
 
00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:05.079 align:start position:0%
accounting unit to the other accounting
 
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
unit and that's the mechanism we use to
 
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.270 align:start position:0%
unit and that's the mechanism we use to
do

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
that and so you moved things around
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
between within within the department yes
 
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
so on page 328 right um at the top
 
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
for class 29 you're talking about right
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so um because I moved that person
 
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
that was funded SE with 75% of it out of
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
the other accounting unit where before I
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
had to transfer it into that accounting
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
unit back into this one now it's fun
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
that funding is is just sited here
 
00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.109 align:start position:0%
that funding is is just sited here
seated

00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
seated
 
00:49:46.119 --> 00:49:48.630 align:start position:0%
seated
here

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
right why don't
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
we there seems to be so much motion here
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
between from from one section to another
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
let's let's go back to the bottom line
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
three page
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
overall right from 100 to 102 how many
 
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
unfunded so in this budget there were 10
 
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
positions that were um budgeted as
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
vacant however nine of those have
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
already been filled so there's really
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
only one position in this budget that is
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
currently vacant um the two new
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
positions are just conversions so we
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
were already paying those um those were
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh temporary full-time positions that we
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
were paying out of class 59 and this was
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
just um to convert those to full-time
 
00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:46.799 align:start position:0%
permanent position so there was which
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
was a zero sum of the for the
 
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:51.640 align:start position:0%
budget so are you saying from what you
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
actually had in
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
2024 you're
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
adding uh two temps became full-time and
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
nine new
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
people nine were vacant and now they're
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they were vacant the
 
00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
whole year um they were at some point in
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
the year they were
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
vacant probably the only a few months we
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
we pretty we we pretty much fill
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
positions as soon as they become open at
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
least we post them and hope to fill them
 
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.190 align:start position:0%
least we post them and hope to fill them
gotta

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
gotta
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Le thanks
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
so U the site evaluation committee which
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
was generally funded the last time
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to have applicants pay that
 
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
fee the cost of that moving forward is
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
or well I'll just say that there were
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
changes made to the SEC um there was
 
00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:50.839 align:start position:0%
legislation that that passed last year
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
um so now for instance the administrator
 
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
is an employee of the Public Utilities
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
Commission um in terms of the funding I
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
think the goal has always been to have
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
it be um uh fees from from applicants
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
but um I I probably should defer to um
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
well I'll let Lenny well I was just
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
going to mention that it falls under the
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh Public Utilities Commission which is
 
00:52:14.349 --> 00:52:14.359 align:start position:0%
will be next it's not really part of the
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
Department of energy except for being
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
administratively attached okay because I
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
saw there's one position there that's
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
eliminated you're saying that's going to
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
the Pu in the next budget yes that's
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
under the pu's bu so if you compared
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
page 336 and
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
338 if you put those together you'll see
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
the person right so in fiscal year 24 he
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
was on page
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
338

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
338
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
now for some reason for 25 that a very
 
00:52:58.750 --> 00:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
there um
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
under class 68 remuneration but maybe we
 
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.789 align:start position:0%
under class 68 remuneration but maybe we
should

00:53:06.789 --> 00:53:06.799 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
wait until we get to that
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
point and
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
consultants and Etc
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
so we should probably defer to the chair
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
of the Public Utilities Commission yeah
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right so let me go
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
see oh let's talk about enforcement page
 
00:53:47.000 --> 00:54:02.630 align:start position:0%
see oh let's talk about enforcement page
329

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
so so there's enforcement and
 
00:54:05.119 --> 00:54:06.589 align:start position:0%
so so there's enforcement and
enforcement

00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
non-federal so what's going on with
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
those why why is the difference first
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement 1888 on page 328 or 327 and
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
328 those are the ones that do the um
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
the pipeline and hazardous material
 
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
which is partially funded by the federal
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
government and the other part is funded
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
by an assessment against gas pipeline
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
utilities only the uh those that are in
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
3357 the enforcement nonfederal they do
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
more of the electricity and other type
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
of um enforcement work for like electric
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
lines and Sewer sewer and water and and
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
other things that's a non-as accounting
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
unit and the gas accounting unit is the
 
00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
1888 got you are any of these group two
 
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.990 align:start position:0%
1888 got you are any of these group two
employees

00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
no no okay and
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
um do they create
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
fines they do the Dig Safe program
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
creates fines which all goes to the
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
general fund okay and it's not a lot
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's only like $60,000 a year I see
 
00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:16.190 align:start position:0%
it's only like $60,000 a year I see
um

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
and is is really um 16 people necessary
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
two well 16 would be the entire division
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
um so we have an electric inspector um
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
we have um administrative staff we have
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
an a director an assistant director um
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
so yes I would I would say this
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
team sure the audit team is also part of
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement so we have five Auditors who
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
audit the books and records of the
 
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
utilities um and their work is primarily
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
in the sort of regulatory functions of
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
the agency um but they're in the
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh and Safety Division so so
 
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
yes it's uh it's uh a what I would say
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
is a a small team with um a lot of
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility I see but they rarely
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
find problems it seems like um it that's
 
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
a good thing um we do we do a lot of
 
00:56:16.589 --> 00:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
Education um especially around Dig Safe
 
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
um so uh you know our teams are
 
00:56:22.109 --> 00:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
proactive and um we we don't want
 
00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
problems yeah okay
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
right um all right so that was let me
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
see here
 
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.750 align:start position:0%
see here
enforcement

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.390 align:start position:0%
enforcement
okay

00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
page so on this one regulatory
 
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
support um both it it and plant and
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
property went away I assume that moved
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
yes um for the 2223 budget I had
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
separated these out to each individual
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
division but um for more efficiencies
 
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
within the department I took all the uh
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
regular um utility assessment related
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
charges and I put them all in our um
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
administrative and support um accounting
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
unit which is 1891 so anything in 28 and
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
27 that you see as a zero would have
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
moved to
 
00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.039 align:start position:0%
1891 just makes it more efficient for
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
the uh the accountant and stuff to pay
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:40.150 align:start position:0%
 
month

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
so that's on page 331 and 332
 
00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:50.309 align:start position:0%
so that's on page 331 and 332
1891

00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
right but I don't see oh I see okay I
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
see yeah yeah yeah
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
TW class 27 and 28
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.119 --> 00:58:08.190 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
so in spite that going
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
away expenses under regulatory
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
20124 so from 2024 actuals to budgeted
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
um it's not not really going up it's we
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
spent less than was budgeted because you
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
if you saw the 2024
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
budget it would have been probably
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
similar to 2025 just we didn't spend as
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
much as we had
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
budgeted and then but it actually goes
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
27 is that cuz some positions were
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
something we had some internal movements
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
um of different positions um you can't
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
really see it here because it was uh
 
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
Zero Sum movements when we did our our
 
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:24.390 align:start position:0%
Zero Sum movements when we did our our
re-budget

00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
re-budget
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
really the only the only difference is
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
we we decrease some cost in uh part-time
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
um we went from two positions to one pos
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
down to one position that was the
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
biggest decrease in that in that uh
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
division than you all right um
 
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
representative evil this is more of a
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
general question um are you concerned
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
since your since your uh budget is
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
largely federally funded could you talk
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit about um any concerns you
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
might have anything you've heard
 
01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
anything you've already observed as far
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
work so for the programs that aren't
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
related or or or are not a part of the
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
iig the IRA um so those funding
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
opportunities that came up in the last
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
two or three years uh laws that P
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
Congress passed um you know I I we've
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
not seen anything uh any substantial
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
changes in the last month for instance
 
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:32.839 align:start position:0%
to Li Heap um or to weatherization um
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
other than complying with uh the
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
president's executive orders that might
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
pertain to the programs um we've not
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
seen any major changes um you know we
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
are uh I I would imagine with any change
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
in administration um there are some
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
communication delays on um programs
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
related to the IRA and some of those
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
newer Federal programs um but in terms
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
of what's in the budget um there have
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
been no major changes and we're
 
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
communicating with staff at H HHS US
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
as it relates to Li Heap um and usdoe on
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
WAP so um I don't see any
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
issues so there were no lines of um
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
money coming from the federal folks that
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
were turned off and then turned on again
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
or anything like that just different
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
programs not for these programs right
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
for the newer Federal programs we have
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
seen that but but not for these we've
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
Downs all right so since we have time
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
let's why don't we go to this uh house
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
build two issue that you wanted to talk
 
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:56.789 align:start position:0%
build two issue that you wanted to talk
about

01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
we will get there but we still have an
 
01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.510 align:start position:0%
we will get there but we still have an
hour

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
hour
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
okay okay there you go see how quick
 
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
this is so I happen to be the chair of
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
the joint committee on dedicated funds
 
01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
thank you or have been and
 
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
um this is what we look at stuff that
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
looks like this and and we every five
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
years we we um review every dedicated
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
fund and I don't remember um this
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
particular one but uh when we reviewed
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
it but what you can see from this report
 
01:02:44.029 --> 01:02:44.039 align:start position:0%
is um fund revenue and fund expenses
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
over time so why don't we start with the
 
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
2023 sure and uh for the record my name
 
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
is uh Chris Alon the Deputy Commissioner
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
of the Department of energy um so I to
 
01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
take a sort of step back the renewable
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
energy fund is funded as part of the
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
state's renewable portfolio standard
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
which is a requirement that electric
 
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
suppliers be they default Service uh
 
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
providing Electric utilities competitive
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
suppliers Community aggregators what
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
have you uh that they purchase a certain
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of their supply uh from one
 
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
of five buckets or what we would call
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
classes of renewable Technologies um and
 
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.039 align:start position:0%
and so every state in New England has a
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
a renewable portfolio standard of some
 
01:03:36.269 --> 01:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
kind or several uh but there's a common
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
market product called a renewable energy
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
certificate which is generated uh when
 
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:44.039 align:start position:0%
when uh a megawatt hour of electric
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
generation from a particular resource is
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
generated uh the those attributes are
 
01:03:51.549 --> 01:03:51.559 align:start position:0%
built into this Market product uh that's
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
tracked regionally um and then used by
 
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
those suppliers to fulfill their
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
obligations under every State's
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard so this is
 
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
a common currency this renewable energy
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
certificate or a wreck and so given the
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
competitive nature of that market and
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's designed to in part
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
incent New Generation uh there might be
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
that risk that we don't have enough
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
renewable uh certificates uh available
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
to meet uh the obligation and so if that
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
happens instead of just having a
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
ridiculous situation where the price
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
goes up infinitely they've built in a a
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
price cap mechanism called an
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payment and so
 
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
those payment rates are set in statute
 
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
and index to inflation for each of the
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
classes and so when uh A supplier goes
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
out and they say okay the cost of these
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
Rex is higher than what the ACP would be
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire they go out and they
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
purchase the alternative compliance
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
payment and that payment goes into the
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund uh and and that
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund is you know in
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
statute its uh purpose is in part to
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
incent uh you know either new renewable
 
01:05:02.349 --> 01:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
electric or thermal generation uh so it
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
funds uh a number of things for the
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
department so uh the staff who deal with
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
the compliance with the renewable
 
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard uh that there's a
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
variety of tasks uh that are um you know
 
01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:17.559 align:start position:0%
uh related to compliance and Analysis of
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
the RPS that our that our staff do uh
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
then there are the programs there are
 
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
the staff administering with the
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
programs and then recently the
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
legislature has given us new tasks um
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
that fall within the renewable energy
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
fund such as the office of offshore wind
 
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
industry development and energy
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
Innovation uh as well as a couple other
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
related to smaller pieces of legislation
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
in the last few years is any of this
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
compliance related to the PE done in the
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
Pu or or is it all in your department so
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
when a uh like a default service utility
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
has to recover the costs associated with
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
their compliance with renewable
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard that uh that recovery
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
happens through the Public Utilities
 
01:05:59.789 --> 01:05:59.799 align:start position:0%
Commission and the department uh we
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
weighs in in those processes to say yep
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
these are reasonable costs to have
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
incurred they can be collected from
 
01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
customers so we set the you know we
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
ensure that people are complying with
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
the law and the recovery of that cost
 
01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
from a utility happens at the Public
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission all right so the
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
utility pays you the ACP payment and
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
then collects it from the customer via
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
the Pu mechanism sure and and yeah and
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
you look into things like did they make
 
01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
the right decision to do an alternative
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
compliance payment versus going out and
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
trying to go to a broker of Rex to maybe
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
save money there and so that's something
 
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
that comes up from time to time in your
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
department or in the Pu at the Public
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission is where that would
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
happened but so the renewable energy
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
fund comes in so sorry that was a long
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
way of getting to it's there's this
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
market right and so the revenues that
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
come in are are variable there's a lot
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
of things that impact the generation
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
what might be out there for Rex whether
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
it's the weather because like a lot of
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
these are renewable technologies that
 
01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
are season
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
dependent whether it's uh you know Hydro
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
solar wind uh you know there there are
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
fuel and supply chain constraints such
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
as like with with biomass resources um
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
and then there's just State policy
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
changes that can impact the market and
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
so uh as you can see in the dedicated
 
01:07:14.109 --> 01:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
funds report thing that you gave me and
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
I just lost um we did see a jump in the
 
01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
previous uh two compliance years uh in
 
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
that Revenue where it had been hovering
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
in the two two and a half million up to
 
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
eight8 and a half million so that was um
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
obviously a pretty pretty big jump and
 
01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh that was happening at the same time
 
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
that we were undergoing some of these
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
pending legislative uh questions about
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not because uh prior to the
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
passage of Senate Bill 303 that the
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner referenced earlier there
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
had been more stringent statutory
 
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
requirements on the spending uh that uh
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
I think basically had been in wide
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
agreement from from us from stakeholders
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
from the legislature uh to not be um as
 
01:07:58.109 --> 01:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
effective at doing its job particularly
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
with a residential solar rebate program
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh and and we also you know in part due
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
to uh things we've seen through uh the
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned the Das transfers
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
we've also pursued some programs with
 
01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities where there's a real
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
value that we've seen and demand um from
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
towns to see if there are opportunities
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
for either Energy Efficiency or solar um
 
01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
in a way that we think is beneficial not
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
not just because it incense renewable
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
energy but also because there are those
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
benefits to taxpayers and it makes a
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
more broad-based um benefit of renewable
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know initiatives uh then then you
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
might see if it was just sort of a say a
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
handout to a solar developer so uh we
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
were happy to see that go forward but
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
you know a consequence of that was that
 
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
we've been um developing these programs
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh that we're going to be be working
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
towards and uh you know I think kind of
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
as referenced earlier uh the
 
01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned that we we don't
 
01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
anticipate there to be major negative
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
impacts with this transfer and that's
 
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
that's true because as you see what's
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
happened isn't that we're planning to
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
decrease the spending the spending is
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
going to be kind of in line with where
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
it where it had been uh what would
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
change is that this $10 million rather
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
than going to increasing the spend for
 
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
for these uh programs that fall under
 
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
the RF would then be going to the
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
general fund and you know it's our view
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
that the legislature and the governor uh
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
can prioritize the spending
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately but you won't see uh a
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
decline in in the spending um it you
 
01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
just won't see an increase so I would
 
01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
say it looks like the spending is
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
increasing if you look at the
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
commitments column of 2024 there's a
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
much bigger number there sure and and
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
and that might uh just be a function of
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
uh you know we we did have you know in
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of that first year we see the
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
revenue coming in so we are going to
 
01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
ramp up the spending a little bit that
 
01:10:00.669 --> 01:10:00.679 align:start position:0%
commitments um obviously uh based on
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
when the dedicated funds report numbers
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
have to come in kind of lines up right
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
in that sweet spot of we've had the
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
revenue come in but we haven't yet got
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
the money out the door because you know
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
projects take time to happen and you go
 
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
through through the process um so those
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
commitments of of $5
 
01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
million uh you know are are mostly due
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
to had been mostly due to existing uh
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
encumbered grants programs things like
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
that um and you know I I I know we can
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
get you the official numbers but we had
 
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.709 align:start position:0%
get you the official numbers but we had
in

01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
September um allocated another $6
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
million uh dollars uh you know budgeted
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
towards towards program spending um I
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
that uh and then yeah so so what we're
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
seeing is a I
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
got yeah so uh one once you take away
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
that 20 million that 5 million that's
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
incumbered the additional 6 million we
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
had some Revenue coming in uh you know
 
01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
takes us to approximately after this 10
 
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
million comes out uh and another 250,000
 
01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
which Dees has uh as a footnote in their
 
01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
section of hp1 uh which is gives a an
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
option for them to take $250,000 to help
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
I think offset some permitting fees uh
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
it it brings us to the neighborhood of
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
about uh 2 million uh remaining uh for
 
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
this this fiscal year and do you expect
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
this increased Revenue in the 8 million
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
range to continue or not uh it's hard to
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
say I I I know that just sort of the
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
initial what we saw for this this
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
upcoming fiscal year it's been down from
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
there I think it's probably more in the
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
line yeah for okay I was going to say 45
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
million so 4.5 uh million dollars in
 
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue um it it really is hard to
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
project but I don't I think these were
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
particularly High what we saw the the
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
previous two years all right
 
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
representative eel and then
 
01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.229 align:start position:0%
representative eel and then
representative

01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
lman um well if it wasn't obvious from
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
what I said before um it strikes me as
 
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
very concerning that this money that was
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
uh raised through statute statute for
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
very very specific purpose is now just
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
being uh taken away from the renewable
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
energy fund and put into the general
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
fund I understand what you said about uh
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
Governor Hassen I don't know what the
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
purpose was for the million dollars and
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
what happened with triap triap may have
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
used it in a way that uh was beneficial
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
from a Energy Efficiency standpoint but
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
just because somebody did it before
 
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't justify it now um and um I I
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
know that we need Revenue in this budget
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
but you know we have a lot of dedicated
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
funds in this state
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that this sets a
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
precedent number one and I was thinking
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
about it driving down this morning and
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
it's like we could run through a field
 
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
of flowers if the at if each dedicated
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
fund was a flower and just go merrily
 
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
plucking uh these flowers to help our
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue situation and honestly Nobody
 
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
Does it so I think there are real uh
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
policy reasons not to go pulling money
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
out of the dedicated fund yes it sounds
 
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
like you could continue to function but
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
it undermines the whole purpose of
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
having gathered this money in the first
 
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
place because you want it to be able to
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
make grants um so I have a problem from
 
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
it on a policy basis I also really
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
question the legality of taking money
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
that was uh gathered in this way or
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
accumulated in this way and putting it
 
01:13:59.310 --> 01:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
into the general fund so
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
um that's my view well and Mr chairman
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
if I may note I think the commissioner
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
did understate um the the previous uh
 
01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
you know uh transfer that we had talked
 
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
about in the 2013 House Bill 2 it was
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
$16.1 Million that was transferred from
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
this fund uh to the general fund and and
 
01:14:21.149 --> 01:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know a million uh or so was was I
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
think dedicated to Tri count cap but
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
there were there was a a greater
 
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
transfer uh you know from the
 
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
Department's view it's it's up to the
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
the governor and the legislature to
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
determine the spending priorities and we
 
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
will do what she tell us to do thank you
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
did representative lean have more of a
 
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
question or I guess a followup to
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative eel's well stated
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
comments it shows on the uh renewable
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
energy fund sheet that we have the
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
commitments being by 5.3 million those
 
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
are commitments what about applications
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
that have been filed
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question it varies by
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
program there are a number of uh
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
programs underneath uh the renewable
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
energy fund and we do have some
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements with how to break
 
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
down that funding including a
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
requirement that uh you know a
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
percentage of the funding be uh
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
allocated to commercial industrial
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
customers and a uh a percentage to
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
residential customers based on
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
essentially their their load share uh
 
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
you know in New Hampshire uh so
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
depending on the program we have some
 
01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
rebate programs that are pretty well
 
01:15:31.229 --> 01:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
subscribed and and could have a wait
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
list there have been others where we've
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
we've struggled to get uh enough
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
applicants uh and certainly quality
 
01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
applicants to to justify each bucket uh
 
01:15:42.629 --> 01:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
of of the programming so we can get you
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
information to whatever extent the
 
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
committee uh desires uh but I I can't
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
say that there's a a particular answer
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
for all of the programs out of the
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund it really is
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
program dependent a followup Mr chairman
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
lks so I guess back to my question if we
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
remove the $10 million what kind of an
 
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
impact will that have on applications
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
that may be
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
pending uh so for what we have already
 
01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
uh essentially allocated we said we were
 
01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
going to spend that that $6 million that
 
01:16:12.189 --> 01:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
I referen in September it would have no
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
impact on those programs uh it would
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
have no impact on our staffing um it
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
would say uh if if you weren't to do
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
this we we would have an extra $10
 
01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
million that we would spend on these
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
programs at at you know at some time I I
 
01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
guess Mr chairman I'm not I guess stting
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
my question accurately because I still
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
not hearing from you if applications are
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
out there and we remove the $10 million
 
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
will that have an impact on those
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
applications so to the extent that an
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
individual applicant feels like they
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
might not want to apply because they
 
01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
think the money is not there that's
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
something that's in up for them what I'm
 
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
just telling you is that it will not
 
01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
affect the the programming the the
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
budget that we've already put out there
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
um I I can't speak to what a particular
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh customer might might think I I'm
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
sorry if I'm not understanding your
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
question so in other words there are no
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
applications pending that the removal of
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
this $10 million will have an impact on
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh correct okay thanks let me ask about
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
this you you keep talking about you
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
approve 6 million in September what was
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
that for because that's obviously new
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's a much bigger number than anything
 
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
page yep uh so that was just as as part
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the the normal course of uh spending
 
01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
out of the renewable energy fund the
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner um will put out uh
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
essentially an order authorizing an
 
01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
allocation of x a million dollars uh you
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
know to fund these programs open the a
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
program window take in applicants for
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
say a rebate program or open an RFP for
 
01:17:57.149 --> 01:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
the competitive programs uh and so
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's just part of the statutory
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the fund is to is to
 
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
spend uh out of it and the commissioner
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
in September it was September 20th um
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
put out a memo confirming that
 
01:18:13.229 --> 01:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
allocation um of $6
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
million so you can't say in particular
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
it went to more solar or more this or
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
something like that I I I'd be happy to
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
provide the memo uh you know after the
 
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
hearing but it it did have allocations
 
01:18:30.990 --> 01:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
specifically to you know uh
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
$244,000 to do to our bulk fed pellet
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
central heating rebates program 100 uh
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
1.5 million to our LMI grant program and
 
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
so on uh dividing up that $6 million
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
within the variety of programs that fall
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
under the renewable energy fund right so
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
to to representative Lehman's question
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
you could have if you didn't if this 10
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
million didn't go away you could do this
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
again next year for example right then
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
and those programs could have that much
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
more stuff yeah I I would anticipate so
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
so the revenue is still going to come in
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
after July 1st and we'll likely have a
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
spending allocation that allocation
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
could be $10 million larger uh if this
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
was available it's up to the legislature
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not that $10 million is
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
better spent in these programs or with
 
01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
in the general
 
01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:19.639 align:start position:0%
fund representative cell thank you Mr
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
chair uh do you know if any of that
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
allocation went to Offshore wind uh
 
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
only to the um extent that our office of
 
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
offshore wind industry development and
 
01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
energy Innovation staff worked on issues
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
related to Offshore wind there were no
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
specific programs or funding that were
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
sent to say an offshore wind developer
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
or anything like that um and and
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
obviously uh you've seen because it just
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
passed the house that there is a bill
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
that would look at reforming that office
 
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
and uh refocusing its Mission uh
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
renaming it to the office of energy
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
Innovation um you know there were
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
recently nuclear related activities
 
01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
added to that office uh that have picked
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
up and and will uh likely continue to
 
01:20:03.629 --> 01:20:03.639 align:start position:0%
pick up and we'll see maybe that'll
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
become more of the focus there are
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of technologies that
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
fall within the idea of energy
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
Innovation representative evil um I
 
01:20:15.629 --> 01:20:15.639 align:start position:0%
actually have here the New Hampshire
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund annual report
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
dated November 1st
 
01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
2024 and it looks like there were a
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
great number of wood pellet boiler
 
01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:31.639 align:start position:0%
furnace uh um grants that were made and
 
01:20:34.350 --> 01:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
and applications um so there's actually
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
quite a variety of things that um have
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
been done and again if you remove the
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
$10 million um you can't you don't have
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to make those grants so
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
um I again I think it's
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
not even though Governor Hassen did it I
 
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
don't know the circumstances yes she's a
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
Democrat blah blah blah I still don't
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
think it's really a great practice to go
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
pulling uh money that was generated for
 
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
specific purposes and dedicated funds to
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
go and do other things it just doesn't
 
01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.510 align:start position:0%
go and do other things it just doesn't
seem

01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
seem
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
right so let me ask about this um
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
residential pellet boiler thing uh what
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
does that program do
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh good question and and I'm I'm the not
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
the perfect person to talk to you about
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
the specifics of all the program and
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative eel for
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
highlighting we do have uh in additions
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
to our uh dedicated funds reporting we
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis send to the uh
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional uh energy Committees of
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate our annual
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
report and there's a lot of good
 
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
information there uh there are two uh
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
residential uh well not two programs
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
related to the wood pellet uh you know
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
heating systems one for residential
 
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
customers one for uh commercial
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
industrial customers um the the
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
residential one has a cap I believe of
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
10,000 it's in here somewhere uh 10,000
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
persistent up to 40% of the cost of the
 
01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
system uh and then uh I'm sorry I don't
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
have the specifics uh off the top of my
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
head for the commercial would it just be
 
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
first come first served among applicants
 
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
uh there is a there is a process that we
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
go through to to um allocate those
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
rebates ensuring that folks are eligible
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
I would have to get back to you if we
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
had enough sub description to get to the
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
weight list kind of exactly how we
 
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
waterfall that priorities I think it
 
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
might be you think it's fully funded
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
there's never a weight list or uh no I I
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
I'd have to get back to you on that
 
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
there there might be we certain be
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
interested yeah just because I heat with
 
01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.149 align:start position:0%
interested yeah just because I heat with
pellets

01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
pellets
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
so and it's my my system needs a new one
 
01:22:44.719 --> 01:22:46.709 align:start position:0%
so and it's my my system needs a new one
so

01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
anyway um okay uh other questions about
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
this I think we understand what it's
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
doing what's going on here I think but
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
we haven't yet decided what to do okay
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
um let's go to the is it the Pu next is
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%

does all right go ahead you can I'll
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
make it very
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
brief um so the Public Utilities
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
Commission has tasked with overseeing
 
01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
safe adequate reliable service adjust
 
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
and reasonable rates for our state's
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
Electric Gas and Water
 
01:23:58.510 --> 01:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
Utilities the Comm the commission's role
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
is as the
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
Arbiter of the customer and regulated
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
utility interests so we're we're
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
balancing that scale the commission
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
regulates over $2 billion in annual
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
revenue and over 8 billion in assets
 
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
with a small staff of 12 that's uh 15
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
including Commissioners where the
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
electric and gas Commodities can vary
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
greatly in Good Times providing
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
affordable energy for New Hampshire
 
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
citizens and businesses and in times of
 
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
high prices an area of considerable cost
 
01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
and stress to the residents and
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state which the
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
commission Works to ameliorate through
 
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
its oversight
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
work uh the site evaluation committee uh
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
has responsibility for the sighting of
 
01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
energy facilities the committee was
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
reformed by the legislature last year
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
from nine to five members moving
 
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement to the doe who you just
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
heard from and combining the SEC and
 
01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
pu's the resources are fungible the SEC
 
01:24:59.950 --> 01:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
um to the point of the representative
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
employee so I can uh I can go over the
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
the budget if you like or yeah let's
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
talk about that so U just on page
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
339 you're going up by 1.1 million over
 
01:25:20.669 --> 01:25:20.679 align:start position:0%
2024 to 2025 now some of that is the
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
extra 300,000 for the site evaluation
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
a committee right but
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
um what what's the rest of it for is it
 
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
is it just normal step increases and so
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
that so you're looking at the actuals
 
01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
versus what was budgeted yeah once again
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
like I'm I I might be some laps involv
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
just we didn't spend as much um compared
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
to what was budgeted for 24 mhm um
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
um and it could be there was uh well
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
there was quite a few of um vacancies
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
that were filled for the for the Pu
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
during that time frame so that could be
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
a big because it's you know is still a
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
fairly new um new agency with new
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
positions um so that that could be a big
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
portion f are any of these 17
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
vacant uh yes one is vacant okay but in
 
01:26:22.109 --> 01:26:22.119 align:start position:0%
2024 more were yeah we had some ins and
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
some outs but there were more vacancies
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
okay and because of the hiring frees
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
you're not going to fill this one that's
 
01:26:29.199 --> 01:26:30.990 align:start position:0%
you're not going to fill this one that's
correct

01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right and that's an
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
unclassified position it's not a
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
classified position that's vacant okay
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
what is all right under evaluation
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
remuneration that's basically for um
 
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
payments to board members for certain
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
things like travel and things like that
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
and and that is only that is coming over
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
from the site evaluation committee um
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's not wasn't part of the Pu before
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
when site evaluation committee was its
 
01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.590 align:start position:0%
when site evaluation committee was its
own

01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
agency so you think that's not going to
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
be spent probably it was decreased from
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
60,000 to 5,000 right but I mean even
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
the 60,000 probably wasn't spent no it
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't spent uh we because of the
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
funding situation with that program we
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
were very cognizant of the money we
 
01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
spend things on and we're very frugal in
 
01:27:27.790 --> 01:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
there CU we don't want to come to the
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to request General
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
funds thank you I'll also just add
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
briefly with the legislative change that
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
moved the SEC from 9 to five members
 
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
there's of course less uh less less need
 
01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
for that funding moving forward gotta
 
01:27:43.239 --> 01:27:45.350 align:start position:0%
for that funding moving forward gotta
okay

01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
um other questions representative wer
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
then representative evil yeah it's been
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
a while since I kept up with the Pu is
 
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
it still three Commissioners that's
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
correct now at one point it was
 
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
recommended that one be an engineer one
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
be an accountant one being a lawyer is
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
that so what is the makeup now of the so
 
01:28:08.669 --> 01:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
I'll answer that question two ways the
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
statute requires that one as a lawyer uh
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
one of the others has to be uh Finance
 
01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh business accounting economics
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
engineering and uh the third is
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
unspecified currently on the commission
 
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
we have uh one lawyer as required I'm an
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
engineer in an MBA and the other
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner is an has a PHD in
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
economics thank
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
you representative V thank you Mr chair
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
I just wondered if you could explain the
 
01:28:45.149 --> 01:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
uh application fee structure to us for
 
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
like the SEC and SEC yeah and when they
 
01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
were last raised Etc May complicated the
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
table is in the is a statute is in
 
01:28:57.229 --> 01:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
statute so it is required that the com
 
01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh the SEC reviews it once a year and
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
can under the statute make changes we
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
have not in the last two or three years
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
that I can recall made any changes to
 
01:29:06.159 --> 01:29:07.109 align:start position:0%
that I can recall made any changes to
the

01:29:07.109 --> 01:29:07.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
statute um I was um um in terms of
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
current SEC activity there's one item
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
before us it's the x178 transmission
 
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
line for
 
01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
eversource uh we resolved a pipeline
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
issue last year but the AC AC it in the
 
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
SEC has been very light uh we have not
 
01:29:29.350 --> 01:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
had a lot of activity lately and that
 
01:29:31.149 --> 01:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
was what was helpful about the
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
legislation last year making resources
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
fungible if we get a northern pass to
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to be able to move
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
resources around to be able to handle a
 
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
heavy load and when it's a light load we
 
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
can um we can leverage the SEC
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate to to what extent for a
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
large project like that do application
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
fees help to offset the costs of the
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
work that you folks do I'm I'm I'm doing
 
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
this off the top of my head I don't know
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
if attorney spidel behind me knows the
 
01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
answer but my recollection is that the
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
table varies from like 60,000 for a huge
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
project to a few thousand for smaller
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
projects and what we've seen while I've
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
been chair of the SEC since November of
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
21 is very very little coming in the way
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
of of fees because we just haven't had
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
that many
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
applications okay thank you yes I just
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
I'm Alexander theor advisor and I just
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
amplifi those comments by mentioning
 
01:30:39.629 --> 01:30:39.639 align:start position:0%
that microphone you can use that one use
 
01:30:41.709 --> 01:30:41.719 align:start position:0%
this one you can use that
 
01:30:41.719 --> 01:30:43.430 align:start position:0%
this one you can use that
M

01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
M
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you state your name again um
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
Alexander spidel senior advisor at the
 
01:30:49.629 --> 01:30:49.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Public Utilities
 
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
Commission um I would just amplify that
 
01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
by saying that when Northern pass came
 
01:30:58.109 --> 01:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
in the the original application and all
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
its permutations from about 11 through
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
18 uh they were paying a lot of fees and
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursing um the SEC for a lot of
 
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
spending for the council for the SEC and
 
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
all those other invoices so when a large
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
project comes in they do reimburse the
 
01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
SEC for its ongoing expenses and the the
 
01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
figures can be very significant hundreds
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars
 
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
Consultants right uh yes and also
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
attorne attorneys and all the folks that
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
do the work thank you so I heard him say
 
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
the commissioner say um northern pass 2
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
is there such a thing is that well there
 
01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
had been the Twin States project that
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
had been proposed recently and then the
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
developer withdrew it on their own so it
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
could come back uh there's always
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
discussions about uh Canadian Hydro
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
power coming down and new New England
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
Atomic power going up sort of in a swap
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
depending on market conditions so
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's still thoughts about that but
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
it's dependent on the investors the the
 
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
business people decide on their own the
 
01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
SEC and the Pu do not control
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
that so this summer I visited um uh lran
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
2 in Rison Quebec which is 20 M North 20
 
01:32:23.229 --> 01:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
hours north of Montreal and um it's one
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
of seven giant hydroelectric power
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
plants on this one giant River and um
 
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
what they told me was they want to sell
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
to us because an awful lot of people in
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
Montreal heat with
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
electricity so their heavy period is the
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
winter and our heavy period for
 
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
electricity is the summer because we
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
cool with electricity right so they
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
thought it would be that's the reason
 
01:32:54.510 --> 01:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
they'd like to sell to us so yes it's
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
very interesting I don't want to waste
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
the committee's time but it may be um of
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
interest that in Canada uh in Montreal
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
there's curtailments being discussed in
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
the winter period there uh they have a
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
lot of heavy industry in Montreal that
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
was drawn in by the cheap electricity
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
from Ontario and elsewhere aluminum
 
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
smelters and steel mills and things of
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
that uh sort and in fact they're talking
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
about the fact they don't have adequate
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
capacity to serve their load so that's a
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
thought so they're interested in our
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
power as much as we are interested in
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
theirs so uh I we don't know if and when
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
any sort of proposal would be made but
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
it's always something that can come
 
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
about thank you other
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
questions no I don't see any all right
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
um did I have any general questions
 
01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.270 align:start position:0%
um did I have any general questions
here

01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:33:52.830 --> 01:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
um I guess we sort of asked right why
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
the 800,000
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
increase over 2024 some was laps some
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
was the site
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
evaluation and some was filling
 
01:34:07.149 --> 01:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
vacancies yeah okay all right should we
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
go on to the consumer
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
Advocate who I see in the
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
room which is Page
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
page good morning Mr chairman members of
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Donald Cree I
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
am the consumer Advocate I just passed
 
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
my 9th anniversary on the job and our
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
task as a small and feisty office of uh
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
six people when we're fully staffed is
 
01:34:38.669 --> 01:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
to represent the interests of
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
residential utility customers of this
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
state uh wherever those interests arise
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
most of the time they arise in front of
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission they
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
also Arise at ISO New England our
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
regional grid operator before the
 
01:34:53.709 --> 01:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
 
01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
before neol which is the stakeholder
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
advisory body to ISO New England and
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
occasionally in proceedings in other
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
states and things like that um our uh
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
budget request as reflected in house
 
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
bill one is I think somewhat less
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
interesting than those that you've just
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
been discussing uh about the Pu and the
 
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy in that it's
 
01:35:19.950 --> 01:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
basically um business as usual for us
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
the OCA is funded via utility assessment
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
not the general fund and uh we developed
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
a budget proposal consistent with the
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
instructions we got from the governor's
 
01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
office and what you see in front of you
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
is the result of that are uh it costs
 
01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
about $1.1 million a year to have the
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
OCA and uh I like to compare us to Maine
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
my counterpart in Maine the public
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh her job is to represent all
 
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
customers not just residential customers
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
and uh up in Maine they have a office
 
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
that has I think about three times our
 
01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
budget and about twice our staff so they
 
01:35:58.430 --> 01:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
do somewhat more than we do but they
 
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
also have a lot more resources than we
 
01:36:00.199 --> 01:36:02.149 align:start position:0%
also have a lot more resources than we
do

01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
um I can certainly talk about what we're
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
up to if you're interested uh or I can
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
answer your questions happy to do
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
whatever would be help let me just start
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
with some Financial questions so you
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
have six people all V all full nonone
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
vacant is that right we do have one
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
vacancy at present yes but in the budget
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
right the budget is fully there's no
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
vacancies in the budget that that person
 
01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:27.149 align:start position:0%
vacancies in the budget that that person
left

01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:27.159 align:start position:0%
left
 
01:36:31.229 --> 01:36:31.239 align:start position:0%
recently gotcha okay and
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
um but in 2024 there were more vacancies
 
01:36:37.390 --> 01:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
right no I'm curious about what's making
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
you think that well if I look on page
 
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
334 the first line um P permanent
 
01:36:51.149 --> 01:36:51.159 align:start position:0%
classified Personnel went from 250,000
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
to 400,000 that's because we added a new
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
staff member to handle Regional and
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
federal work for us okay but the count
 
01:37:02.910 --> 01:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
didn't go up so they had they had the
 
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
position authorized in the budget just
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
took a while for it to get filled okay
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so that there was a
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
vacancy I guess and this is an expensive
 
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
person basically probably relatively
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
speaking we we have an attorney who does
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
that work for us but their benefits what
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
what's weird is is their salary went up
 
01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.390 align:start position:0%
what's weird is is their salary went up
in

01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
2026 I don't understand that yeah that
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
would be above my pay grade as
 
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
well do you know or yeah well it all
 
01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
just depends on what you budgeted at and
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
what you you filled it with so you could
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
bu when you budget a vacant position you
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
budgeted as um you know Health Plus one
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
and you could have hired somebody that's
 
01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
married and has a has a um has a family
 
01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
plan okay um there could have been I
 
01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if there were other vacancies
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know people being um throughout the
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the year not it wouldn't have
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
been the entire year um but really when
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
you're looking at what was budgeted and
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
what was spent you know spent is actual
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
so you may not realize what was in the
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
budget um and that goes for um Personnel
 
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
costs and and for benefits also okay so
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 25 you budgeted for um
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
consultants and temps did you actually
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
use any or are you this year no that's
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
what for the uh tempor temporary
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
positions that's why we removed it from
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
the budget um so that that 56,000 that
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
was budgeted in um fy2 will not be spent
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
and for Consultants
 
01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
um uh that we mainly budget out or we
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
mainly pay contracts out of the
 
01:38:50.589 --> 01:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
litigation line 233 so that will also
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
not be spent gotcha
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay and that's why it was removed in 26
 
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
27 right so why is this sort of an a
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
separate entity and not part of the
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:39:07.950 --> 01:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
energy um the department of Energy's job
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
is to advance the policy agenda of the
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
executive branch with respect to energy
 
01:39:16.830 --> 01:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
and our job is to advance the interests
 
01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
of residential utility customers so that
 
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
basically means trying to make sure that
 
01:39:23.669 --> 01:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
rates are as low as possible and and
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
also that there is as much uh individual
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
freedom I guess you would say as
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
possible for uh customers and
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
um I've I've held the job for nine years
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
so I've worked under Democratic
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
Governors and Democratic legislatur and
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
Republican Governors and Republican
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
legislatur and everybody who uh has a
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
partis an affiliation has a particular
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
policy agenda that they pursue and I uh
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
I it's not my job to complain about any
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
of those things but it is my job to make
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
sure that those things are not unfairly
 
01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:01.639 align:start position:0%
placed on the backs of residential
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
utility customers and so that's the
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
interest that I I assert and I do that
 
01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
independently we uh unlike the Pu
 
01:40:12.750 --> 01:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or the commissioner or
 
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of energy or really
 
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
any of the other Commissioners in the
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
executive branch I'm truly independent
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
I'm insulated from the kind of uh
 
01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
political considerations that most
 
01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
executive branch appointees feel because
 
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
we have an Advisory board that operates
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
as a kind of a buffer between me and the
 
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
governor and the
 
01:40:37.629 --> 01:40:37.639 align:start position:0%
council and and what power do you have
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
to do things for the consumer that's an
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
excellent question and I I I hope this
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't come across as a glib answer but
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
the the the honest answer is none uh I
 
01:40:52.669 --> 01:40:52.679 align:start position:0%
am the consumer advocate so all I can do
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
is martial my team and be as persuasive
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
as we can in uh calling for results that
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
are rate pay or favorable so both in the
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
legislature and at the Pu yes although I
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
would say primarily at the Pu uh
 
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
legislative work is uh a relatively
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
modest slice of what we do because from
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
my perspective policy choices made by
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature you folks are the
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
elected officials and I'm not so you
 
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
answer to your constituents in a way
 
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
that I don't and so I I accept it face
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
value as a given the policy choices you
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
make you know you were talking earlier
 
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
about the renewable portfolio standard
 
01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
and Reggie and things like that I I tend
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
not to testify about bills that relate
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
to those things because I think those
 
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
are environmental policies that the
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
legislature gets to
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
make represent leean thank you Mr
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
chairman I guess kind of a followup just
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
where I think the chairman was going
 
01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:55.719 align:start position:0%
have you have a fairly good success rate
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
your recommendations to the Pu to
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
because I think politically speaking I
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
don't think Democrats and Republicans
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
are that different on the issue of
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
seeing lower rates for our constituents
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
and we often hear that our rates are
 
01:42:12.270 --> 01:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
some of the highest in the country so
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
have you had some success in promoting
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh constituents lower rates with the Pu
 
01:42:22.350 --> 01:42:22.360 align:start position:0%
or are you just uh pounding at windmills
 
01:42:24.270 --> 01:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
so to speak
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh most of the time we negotiate
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
agreements with other players in puc
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
proceedings and we do pretty well with
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
them so it's relatively unusual to fight
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the death in front of the Pu and have
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
the Pu say it does happen occasionally
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
but it's relatively unusual for the Pu
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
to say well I listen to the utility and
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
I listen to the Department of energy and
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
I listen to the consumer Advocate and
 
01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
gosh the consumer Advocate is right so
 
01:42:54.589 --> 01:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to adopt the consumer
 
01:42:57.390 --> 01:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
Advocates position usually it usually
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
those things are hammered out in
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
negotiations and I think we have a
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
pretty decent success rate thanks thanks
 
01:43:05.229 --> 01:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative Griffin thank
 
01:43:07.589 --> 01:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I'd like to get back to the
 
01:43:10.990 --> 01:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
numbers for a minute the um benefit
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
package it looks like it's approaching
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
60% of
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
salaries and that seems quite a bit
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
higher than the other state agencies are
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
running and um I'm wondering what it's
 
01:43:27.149 --> 01:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
made up of this driving
 
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
it it's basically if someone has a
 
01:43:31.629 --> 01:43:31.639 align:start position:0%
family plan they get a family plan if
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
they don't they then they get a
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
different plan and there's really
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
nothing we don't negotiate or put in the
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
the benefit rates that's all done by
 
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services it
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
could be that OCA has a higher
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
percentage of married Personnel that
 
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.229 align:start position:0%
 
other

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
questions yeah representative this is
 
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps sort of an obvious question but
 
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
if your office didn't exist who would
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
represent the interests of the rate
 
01:44:06.910 --> 01:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
payers in New
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh again without trying to
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
seem glib uh I think the answer is
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
nobody right that's the reason that
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
there are I I just counted this
 
01:44:17.790 --> 01:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday over the weekend uh in light
 
01:44:19.629 --> 01:44:19.639 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 610 which calls for the
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
abolition of our office there are 43
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
states that have some version of our
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
office uh at least as measured by
 
01:44:30.589 --> 01:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
membership in our National Association
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
so there's something of a national cons
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
consensus that the regulatory process is
 
01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
helped by the existence of a independent
 
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
rate payer Advocate ultimately what we
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
do I think is help the Pu make good
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
decisions right because the the Pu
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
exists to arbitrate between the interest
 
01:44:50.430 --> 01:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
of utility shareholders and utility
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
customers well the shareholders are very
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
well represented
 
01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh as I I think you can understand and
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
so if you put a little weight on the
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
other side of the scale then then the
 
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
process the public can have more
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
confidence that the process was
 
01:45:06.910 --> 01:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
conducted in a fair and thorough Manner
 
01:45:08.790 --> 01:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
and and then you have the department of
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
energy which is caved off of the Pu four
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
years ago and so it is doing some of the
 
01:45:19.350 --> 01:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
same work that used to be done by the Pu
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
in a more neutral way our job is to
 
01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
Advocate and that's what we
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
do who are the seven states that
 
01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
don't uh off the top of my head uh there
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
are weird assortment of States Georgia
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
North Dakota New York for some reason uh
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
I think um
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
Idaho and I forgotten the other three
 
01:45:46.189 --> 01:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
but it's it's it's a weird list because
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't tell you anything like it's
 
01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
not it's red States and blue States it's
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
States all over the country it's well
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
you did mention the state that has the
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
lowest electric rates in the
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
country uh meaning North Dakota
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
Idaho they have the most um
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hydro of any any state so it makes their
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
electricity very cheap I just came home
 
01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
from a trip to Iceland and in Iceland
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
they are just using electricity there
 
01:46:16.830 --> 01:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
like it's there's no tomorrow because
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
they they have tons of hydr capacity and
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
they have tons of geothermal capacity
 
01:46:22.750 --> 01:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
because it's basically a big volcano on
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
top top of a glacier that's uh that's
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous but it's great for cheap
 
01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
electricity other
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
questions okay we'll let you go thank
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
you all right so we're coming back at
 
01:46:36.159 --> 01:46:38.270 align:start position:0%
you all right so we're coming back at
115

01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
115
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
doit that's a tough one would you have
 
01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
any interest in just passing on this I
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
mean all they have with General funds is
 
01:46:52.189 --> 01:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
$2,500 yeah but I I want to we have that
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
house bill we he's talking about so we
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
have to talk about that
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
why why the elimination of the agency
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
yeah but it didn't pass oh it didn't
 
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
pass well I don't know I don't know what
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:51.830 align:start position:0%

03:16:31.189 --> 03:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and members of
 
03:16:33.189 --> 03:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
the division one finance committee my
 
03:16:34.830 --> 03:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
name is Dennis goule I'm the
 
03:16:36.070 --> 03:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
03:16:39.790 --> 03:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
Information Technology with me is um Ken
 
03:16:41.469 --> 03:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
Dunn who's the Deputy Commissioner and
 
03:16:43.750 --> 03:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
normally I'd have my Director of Finance
 
03:16:45.150 --> 03:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
but she retired right in the middle of
 
03:16:47.670 --> 03:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
the budget so
 
03:16:50.309 --> 03:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know so you're Flying Blind
 
03:16:52.990 --> 03:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
yeah well we are weaker than usual I
 
03:16:55.790 --> 03:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
will say that um don't don't be
 
03:16:57.309 --> 03:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
concerned that I have this lengthy
 
03:16:58.830 --> 03:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
presentation I'm not taking you through
 
03:17:01.110 --> 03:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
every word but some of this may be stuff
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
you'd want to look at after the fact um
 
03:17:05.510 --> 03:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
on the first page just introductions and
 
03:17:07.189 --> 03:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
some background the one thing I'd call
 
03:17:09.150 --> 03:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
out is you know we are a centralized
 
03:17:11.229 --> 03:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
organization in New Hampshire and and
 
03:17:12.830 --> 03:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
from what I can tell in the research
 
03:17:14.269 --> 03:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
that I've done we began that
 
03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
centralization Pro uh process earlier
 
03:17:18.550 --> 03:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
than any other state that I'm aware of
 
03:17:20.870 --> 03:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
the the other Mo were probably one of
 
03:17:23.550 --> 03:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
the two most centralized states that and
 
03:17:26.830 --> 03:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
Louisiana of all places um are very
 
03:17:29.349 --> 03:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
similar in how they're organized moving
 
03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
on to page two um this is just a top
 
03:17:34.429 --> 03:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
level look at our strateg current
 
03:17:36.830 --> 03:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
strategic plan we actually I was just
 
03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
talking to representative eel because
 
03:17:40.469 --> 03:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
she's on the uh Information Technology
 
03:17:42.189 --> 03:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
Council and she was part of that
 
03:17:44.189 --> 03:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
development of this strategic plan along
 
03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the council and we're
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
working on on the next iteration of that
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
and there'll be some changes coming but
 
03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
one thing I would note is that there you
 
03:17:55.349 --> 03:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
don't see if you go into the uh details
 
03:17:57.429 --> 03:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
of our strategic plan you won't see
 
03:18:00.750 --> 03:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
technology there it's about outcomes for
 
03:18:03.070 --> 03:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
us and you know I use technology to
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
deliver those
 
03:18:08.590 --> 03:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
outcomes um page three again goes over
 
03:18:10.469 --> 03:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
um kind of some top level things that we
 
03:18:13.110 --> 03:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
think about as related to the Strategic
 
03:18:15.990 --> 03:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
plan and activities we do to support it
 
03:18:17.550 --> 03:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
um the one thing you know a couple
 
03:18:20.910 --> 03:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
things there that are um really driving
 
03:18:22.630 --> 03:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh what we're doing lately obviously
 
03:18:26.349 --> 03:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
adapting to Ai and what you know what
 
03:18:28.750 --> 03:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's doing to us or what we would do
 
03:18:31.269 --> 03:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
with it um one of the challenges that
 
03:18:32.990 --> 03:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
states are are dealing with with
 
03:18:35.750 --> 03:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence is the privacy
 
03:18:38.349 --> 03:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
of information and making sure that our
 
03:18:40.469 --> 03:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
our vendors who are embedding AI in in
 
03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
their products are doing so in a
 
03:18:44.469 --> 03:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
responsible way from a privacy
 
03:18:47.229 --> 03:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
perspective um the other is obviously
 
03:18:50.189 --> 03:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
the transformation from traditional on
 
03:18:52.349 --> 03:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
premise systems to Cloud systems which
 
03:18:55.349 --> 03:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
is happening in the past 5 years of all
 
03:18:58.630 --> 03:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
the procurements that agency agencies
 
03:19:01.110 --> 03:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
have done or or doit has done for
 
03:19:04.830 --> 03:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
Solutions all but one were uh the the
 
03:19:07.269 --> 03:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
winning bidder was a Cloud solution and
 
03:19:10.550 --> 03:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
that one uh that wasn't was the rim
 
03:19:12.269 --> 03:19:12.279 align:start position:0%
system the revenue information system
 
03:19:15.309 --> 03:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
and that vendor is also now deploying
 
03:19:17.429 --> 03:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
all their new customers in the cloud
 
03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
so moving on to page four um cyber
 
03:19:24.910 --> 03:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
security um I'll suffice to say that I
 
03:19:27.469 --> 03:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
feel like a hamster on a wheel as it
 
03:19:30.070 --> 03:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
relates to cyber security we we keep
 
03:19:33.229 --> 03:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
running uh the criminals and and and our
 
03:19:36.510 --> 03:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
enemies keep adapting uh more quickly
 
03:19:39.550 --> 03:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
than you know it seems each year they're
 
03:19:41.469 --> 03:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
they're adapting more quickly and and
 
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
and developing new solutions to disrupt
 
03:19:46.830 --> 03:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
or steel or both um so that's a you know
 
03:19:49.469 --> 03:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
a big Focus for us so I have to ask a
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
question here do you do easy
 
03:19:55.990 --> 03:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
pass uh that that's actually um the um
 
03:19:57.910 --> 03:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
there's a a vendor that supports Easy
 
03:20:00.750 --> 03:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
Pass under contract with DOT okay
 
03:20:02.750 --> 03:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
because I think they've been hacked I
 
03:20:06.349 --> 03:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
just got over lunch an email a text that
 
03:20:10.389 --> 03:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
said um you owe money to Easy Pass click
 
03:20:13.710 --> 03:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
here yeah and and their website is down
 
03:20:15.590 --> 03:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
because I tried to log in to see my
 
03:20:15.600 --> 03:20:17.349 align:start position:0%
because I tried to log in to see my
account

03:20:17.349 --> 03:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
account
 
03:20:19.070 --> 03:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm worried that they they've been
 
03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
hacked Yeah well yeah don't don't click
 
03:20:25.870 --> 03:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
no yeah they came out yeah don't click
 
03:20:31.910 --> 03:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
on of course I didn't click on I got the
 
03:20:34.950 --> 03:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
very but the point is I know enough not
 
03:20:37.870 --> 03:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
to but maybe not everybody does well and
 
03:20:39.670 --> 03:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
and that's a big big challenge because
 
03:20:41.750 --> 03:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
when something happens people want to
 
03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
know how will how can you stop that and
 
03:20:45.510 --> 03:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
the and the answer is you can't I mean
 
03:20:48.670 --> 03:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to creatively spam you
 
03:20:51.269 --> 03:20:51.279 align:start position:0%
with you know to steal your um identity
 
03:20:54.110 --> 03:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
and then use it for nefarious purposes
 
03:20:55.550 --> 03:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
um you know there's nothing we can do to
 
03:20:57.870 --> 03:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
stop that via well for emails it we're
 
03:21:00.510 --> 03:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
better off because we have tools that
 
03:21:02.269 --> 03:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
look at the emails and try to evaluate
 
03:21:04.229 --> 03:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
so most of that gets filtered out but
 
03:21:06.269 --> 03:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
for the texts that's not the
 
03:21:09.510 --> 03:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
case and and cold calling as well but
 
03:21:12.309 --> 03:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
that isn't in your department easy in
 
03:21:15.469 --> 03:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
particular well it it's we assist uh
 
03:21:17.309 --> 03:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
back when that contract was entered into
 
03:21:19.469 --> 03:21:19.479 align:start position:0%
we were assisting with the the contract
 
03:21:21.429 --> 03:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
but the implementation and support is is
 
03:21:23.950 --> 03:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
all a third party gotcha all right thank
 
03:21:32.189 --> 03:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
you and uh so uh moving on to page five
 
03:21:36.030 --> 03:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
um key points here um we work you know
 
03:21:39.630 --> 03:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
we have an IT lead for every agency um
 
03:21:42.189 --> 03:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
in fact one it lead we have one it lead
 
03:21:44.790 --> 03:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
who does 20 plus agencies all the small
 
03:21:46.870 --> 03:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
agencies is one and then but the other
 
03:21:48.550 --> 03:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh agencies mostly have their own it
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
lead that person and our finance folks
 
03:21:53.429 --> 03:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
work with the agencies to develop their
 
03:21:57.389 --> 03:21:57.399 align:start position:0%
class their doit budgets and um and the
 
03:21:59.590 --> 03:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
results of that are what you see here
 
03:22:02.189 --> 03:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
today um some trends that I just really
 
03:22:04.150 --> 03:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
think are as valuable to go over and
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
then we'll jump into the numbers
 
03:22:09.469 --> 03:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
is uh the the switch from traditional
 
03:22:11.710 --> 03:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
license and maintenance model you know a
 
03:22:14.150 --> 03:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
capital intensive model to the operating
 
03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
mod operational intensive model has is
 
03:22:20.670 --> 03:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
nearly completed but but and and so just
 
03:22:22.469 --> 03:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
about every procurement that we do to
 
03:22:24.710 --> 03:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
replace an old system it goes from the
 
03:22:26.950 --> 03:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
capex model to the operating model
 
03:22:30.590 --> 03:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
what's the big difference there well the
 
03:22:32.349 --> 03:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
the uh the operating model or the
 
03:22:33.790 --> 03:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
subscription model is the gift that
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
keeps on giving in the in the old in the
 
03:22:39.309 --> 03:22:39.319 align:start position:0%
old days you would potentially have a
 
03:22:41.070 --> 03:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
you know a one-time expense that might
 
03:22:42.830 --> 03:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
have even been capitalized to buy the
 
03:22:45.229 --> 03:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
licenses and then you'd have a say 15 or
 
03:22:47.670 --> 03:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
177% of that annually to pay for
 
03:22:50.990 --> 03:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance but once that Capital
 
03:22:53.910 --> 03:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
initial investment was um you know Debt
 
03:22:55.550 --> 03:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
Service there really wasn't any so if
 
03:22:57.670 --> 03:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
you ran the if you Debt Service over
 
03:22:59.870 --> 03:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
three or five years after that's done
 
03:23:01.429 --> 03:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
you know the software was essentially
 
03:23:04.469 --> 03:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
free except for the maintenance now um
 
03:23:07.630 --> 03:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
with in the case of um subscriptions it
 
03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
goes on forever and that was a that was
 
03:23:13.309 --> 03:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
done by the software industry to uh to
 
03:23:15.150 --> 03:23:15.160 align:start position:0%
flatten their revenue curve because it
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
was really bumpy but also you can see
 
03:23:19.229 --> 03:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's a revenue enhancer for them
 
03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
and a stability over the long term but
 
03:23:22.510 --> 03:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
it costs us more
 
03:23:25.750 --> 03:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
money um very significant price
 
03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
increases particularly over the last
 
03:23:30.389 --> 03:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
three or four years really we're seeing
 
03:23:34.510 --> 03:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
steep increases way way larger than what
 
03:23:38.349 --> 03:23:38.359 align:start position:0%
the the stated rate of inflation is um
 
03:23:41.429 --> 03:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
and the the vendors have realized that
 
03:23:44.630 --> 03:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
um you can't you can't not upgrade
 
03:23:46.150 --> 03:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
anymore because of cyber security
 
03:23:47.990 --> 03:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
concern concerns and particularly in a
 
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
state environment where we're regulated
 
03:23:52.910 --> 03:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
by the multiple federal agencies and the
 
03:23:56.309 --> 03:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
payment card industry um they shorten
 
03:23:58.670 --> 03:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
their life cycles arbitrarily so you
 
03:24:01.590 --> 03:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
have to buy new stuff and then we have
 
03:24:03.110 --> 03:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
to buy the new stuff in order to stay in
 
03:24:05.790 --> 03:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
compliance so it's a game and um so
 
03:24:07.229 --> 03:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's happened and that drives
 
03:24:09.030 --> 03:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
costs up as well and
 
03:24:09.040 --> 03:24:10.550 align:start position:0%
costs up as well and
then

03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:24:13.469 --> 03:24:13.479 align:start position:0%
uh can I ask you about are we on page
 
03:24:17.670 --> 03:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
six here or Beyond y
 
03:24:20.150 --> 03:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
I want to ask you about the very last
 
03:24:24.309 --> 03:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
thing fiscal year 2024 expenditures
 
03:24:29.349 --> 03:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
12.8 million plus 14.8 incumbrance carry
 
03:24:31.750 --> 03:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
forward what does that mean well that's
 
03:24:34.070 --> 03:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
what was encumbered during that fiscal
 
03:24:36.990 --> 03:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
year but hadn't been spent
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
yet so you ordered stuff and that hadn't
 
03:24:42.429 --> 03:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
shown up or a contract was entered into
 
03:24:44.710 --> 03:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
or or something like that yeah okay so
 
03:24:46.670 --> 03:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
that was and we put that there because
 
03:24:48.550 --> 03:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
it all if you just put the um
 
03:24:50.070 --> 03:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
expenditures it looks like we're over
 
03:24:52.229 --> 03:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
budgeting by quite a bit but we're we're
 
03:24:54.389 --> 03:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
kind of we're fairly close in on that
 
03:24:58.309 --> 03:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
year to um actually encumbering what we
 
03:25:00.070 --> 03:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
spending and encumbering what we had in
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
the budget so did that 14.8 million not
 
03:25:10.150 --> 03:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
show up as an expense in fiscal year
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
2024 I mean it doesn't look like it from
 
03:25:16.510 --> 03:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
my point no huh no it didn't it didn't
 
03:25:19.429 --> 03:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
okay but you're not expecting to in
 
03:25:22.870 --> 03:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2025 to encumber
 
03:25:25.830 --> 03:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
another 15 million or something well
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's the Run rate we'll end up
 
03:25:30.070 --> 03:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
with you know carry forward incumbrances
 
03:25:30.080 --> 03:25:31.389 align:start position:0%
with you know carry forward incumbrances
every

03:25:31.389 --> 03:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
every
 
03:25:31.399 --> 03:25:33.309 align:start position:0%
every
year

03:25:33.309 --> 03:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:25:36.030 --> 03:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
03:25:38.830 --> 03:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
so in fact this this year it'll be
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
probably more because we had arpa funds
 
03:25:43.150 --> 03:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
in in in there as well so but that we
 
03:25:44.750 --> 03:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't include that in reports to you
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
on the operating budget but it'll
 
03:25:48.670 --> 03:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
probably be the largest ever carry
 
03:25:50.309 --> 03:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
forward okay so on the same page it says
 
03:25:54.790 --> 03:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2025 137 million right yeah
 
03:25:56.309 --> 03:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
but you're expecting to add to it
 
03:25:59.670 --> 03:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
another 15 no we're expecting to show a
 
03:26:03.550 --> 03:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
exp a a outflow an expense of less than
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
137 plus a carry forward encumbrance
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
which would then be our what our total U
 
03:26:11.790 --> 03:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
commitment for that
 
03:26:14.670 --> 03:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
year okay all right so you're expecting
 
03:26:18.550 --> 03:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
to lapse some yeah from 137 yeah well it
 
03:26:19.750 --> 03:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
could be you know I don't know what our
 
03:26:21.349 --> 03:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
carry forward on expense will be this
 
03:26:24.269 --> 03:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
time it's probably going to be um we
 
03:26:26.309 --> 03:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
probably will lapse and I because of
 
03:26:27.950 --> 03:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
what we've done on the labor side of
 
03:26:31.110 --> 03:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
things which I'll explain um but we've
 
03:26:33.189 --> 03:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
you know we kind of stopped filling most
 
03:26:34.670 --> 03:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
positions back
 
03:26:37.830 --> 03:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
in you know late September early October
 
03:26:39.750 --> 03:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh We've we've hardly filled any
 
03:26:41.189 --> 03:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
positions since
 
03:26:45.150 --> 03:26:45.160 align:start position:0%
then um so so the labor Line's probably
 
03:26:47.670 --> 03:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
going to be pretty low relative to
 
03:26:50.429 --> 03:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
budget for what I'm trying to get at is
 
03:26:53.630 --> 03:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples comparison of fiscal
 
03:26:56.750 --> 03:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
year 24 25 26
 
03:27:00.550 --> 03:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
27 okay MH so should I start with fiscal
 
03:27:03.389 --> 03:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
year 24
 
03:27:03.399 --> 03:27:05.429 align:start position:0%
year 24
36.7

03:27:05.429 --> 03:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
36.7
 
03:27:08.790 --> 03:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
136.6 yes y okay and what's the
 
03:27:11.790 --> 03:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
corresponding number for the next three
 
03:27:19.070 --> 03:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:21.670 --> 03:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
the a completed year will be a
 
03:27:23.349 --> 03:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
combination of what we spent plus what
 
03:27:25.910 --> 03:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
we can inumber and carry forward that
 
03:27:28.710 --> 03:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
will be true for all of these years okay
 
03:27:30.750 --> 03:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
how much we carry forward will depend on
 
03:27:35.309 --> 03:27:35.319 align:start position:0%
how much got was uh encumbered at the
 
03:27:37.950 --> 03:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
later stages of a fiscal year or a
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
larger contract that was going over over
 
03:27:45.790 --> 03:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
a period of time so um we probably could
 
03:27:47.870 --> 03:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
get you the what we think a carry
 
03:27:51.189 --> 03:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
forward would be 425 but I I don't have
 
03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
that with me today okay CU because I
 
03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
really want to
 
03:27:59.070 --> 03:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
know how much this budget is
 
03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
increasing from year to year to year
 
03:28:05.349 --> 03:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
right because basically the amount of
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
money we have to spend is what we had in
 
03:28:11.469 --> 03:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
03:28:17.309 --> 03:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
2024 okay and so we can't have a 15%
 
03:28:20.710 --> 03:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
increase over that number that's our
 
03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
problem okay well and and I I'll talk to
 
03:28:25.830 --> 03:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
you about that in fact we're on page six
 
03:28:27.670 --> 03:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
so if you like I can jump into these
 
03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
numbers okay so there's there's
 
03:28:33.469 --> 03:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
uh this is the heart and soul of the
 
03:28:35.150 --> 03:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
presentation the first line direct
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
agency that's a bunch of different
 
03:28:38.590 --> 03:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
accounting units that
 
03:28:42.389 --> 03:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
are basically the agency direct piece of
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
the budget which is largely driven by
 
03:28:47.189 --> 03:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
the agency themselves so what we did
 
03:28:50.830 --> 03:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
once again this this period was work
 
03:28:53.309 --> 03:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
with the governor's budget director um
 
03:28:58.590 --> 03:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
James and agreed that agency overall
 
03:29:01.870 --> 03:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
targets could include increases in doit
 
03:29:03.389 --> 03:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
as long as they made their own their
 
03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
overall budget targets so that's
 
03:29:10.910 --> 03:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
why this is that particular line went up
 
03:29:13.550 --> 03:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
a lot because the agencies decided to
 
03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
invest in
 
03:29:19.150 --> 03:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
it um and and um you know cut elsewhere
 
03:29:20.990 --> 03:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
is what I'm assuming I you know I don't
 
03:29:22.870 --> 03:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
have visibility into everybody's budget
 
03:29:25.030 --> 03:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
I didn't look at it but right that's
 
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm assuming because they they were
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
able to make the the budget targets and
 
03:29:32.550 --> 03:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
still have but what I'm telling you is
 
03:29:34.710 --> 03:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
their targets were
 
03:29:39.189 --> 03:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
inaccurate okay so by a large number MH
 
03:29:42.429 --> 03:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
okay so if and the way this works is if
 
03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
if an agency's under pressure and they
 
03:29:46.550 --> 03:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
say that they'd like to cut their doit
 
03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
budget we work with them to do that okay
 
03:29:50.229 --> 03:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
in fact we've worked with if if you if
 
03:29:52.189 --> 03:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
we showed you every single agency you'd
 
03:29:55.269 --> 03:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
see that some had cut their doit budgets
 
03:29:57.349 --> 03:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
and others had increased it and the net
 
03:30:01.389 --> 03:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
of that became you know a you know a six
 
03:30:08.349 --> 03:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
6.26 uh about 6.2 increase from the um
 
03:30:11.790 --> 03:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
from year-over-year from the um previous
 
03:30:14.910 --> 03:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
so so that again we we're happy to you
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
know if if B if agencies were under
 
03:30:18.349 --> 03:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
pressure and they want to cut their doit
 
03:30:20.830 --> 03:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
budgets in these in that area we're
 
03:30:22.229 --> 03:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
happy to work with them to do that and
 
03:30:24.990 --> 03:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
we have already um in fact we've done a
 
03:30:26.910 --> 03:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
lot of work particularly you know Dr
 
03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
we've done some work with we've done
 
03:30:30.189 --> 03:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
some work with liquor on that banking so
 
03:30:31.710 --> 03:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
there's there a number of agencies where
 
03:30:33.070 --> 03:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
they said all right we we want to make
 
03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
adjustments and we did that made some
 
03:30:37.950 --> 03:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
fairly large ones at liquor that's
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
represented in in in this budget
 
03:30:43.469 --> 03:30:43.479 align:start position:0%
already so that area is again it's a
 
03:30:45.469 --> 03:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort we we Chang the
 
03:30:47.070 --> 03:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
numbers but it's business priority
 
03:30:49.150 --> 03:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
decisions inside the agencies now the
 
03:30:50.950 --> 03:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs there
 
03:30:52.710 --> 03:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
03:30:56.950 --> 03:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:01.349 --> 03:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
the most agencies didn't give us any in
 
03:31:03.670 --> 03:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
fact none of them gave us APNs except
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
for DHHS and I I have that that detailed
 
03:31:09.910 --> 03:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:12.630 --> 03:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
presentation um so moving down to
 
03:31:15.469 --> 03:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
Central IT services uh that that's the
 
03:31:17.429 --> 03:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
stuff that everybody
 
03:31:20.229 --> 03:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
runs um and and everybody's dependent on
 
03:31:23.550 --> 03:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
we basically to get to this number we so
 
03:31:27.870 --> 03:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
we there's a a $400,000 reduction from
 
03:31:31.670 --> 03:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
25 authorized to uh 26 efficiency and
 
03:31:36.189 --> 03:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
then another 119 going from 26 to 27
 
03:31:38.790 --> 03:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
that we got by pulling anything that was
 
03:31:42.429 --> 03:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
new and anything that we could do
 
03:31:45.510 --> 03:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
without that's this that's a really skin
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's no no fluff or Headroom in that
 
03:31:49.229 --> 03:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
at all in fact we're kind of worried
 
03:31:51.269 --> 03:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
about that number because if anything
 
03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
goes bump in the night which it almost
 
03:31:54.630 --> 03:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
always does during a banum I don't have
 
03:31:56.990 --> 03:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
any head room to adjust to it but but
 
03:32:00.150 --> 03:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
that is um that's a pretty um aggressive
 
03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
Target there that that we went after and
 
03:32:05.349 --> 03:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh so so I'd say and that's one of our
 
03:32:07.150 --> 03:32:07.160 align:start position:0%
challenges is all of the stuff almost
 
03:32:09.269 --> 03:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
all the stuff in there is running and
 
03:32:11.630 --> 03:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's inflating in how much it costs us
 
03:32:13.790 --> 03:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
every year and more than on that more
 
03:32:16.750 --> 03:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
than the rate of inflation
 
03:32:19.189 --> 03:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
moving on to salaries and benefits when
 
03:32:21.750 --> 03:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
we learned about the initial targets
 
03:32:25.630 --> 03:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
from from Governor sonunu um I I sto I
 
03:32:28.510 --> 03:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
asked I stopped approving
 
03:32:31.189 --> 03:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
backfills um that was back in you know
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
sometime in October and um so we haven't
 
03:32:36.870 --> 03:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
been filling for the most part a couple
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
strategic positions we filled in fact I
 
03:32:41.790 --> 03:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
did get a waiver to backfill our
 
03:32:43.469 --> 03:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
Director of Finance because we thought
 
03:32:45.950 --> 03:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
that was kind of important and uh so so
 
03:32:47.389 --> 03:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
that will be filled but for the most
 
03:32:49.229 --> 03:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
part we haven't filled positions and we
 
03:32:52.150 --> 03:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
did unfund all of the open positions at
 
03:32:55.110 --> 03:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
that point in time in in the budget and
 
03:32:56.750 --> 03:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'll go over that more detail later on
 
03:32:58.510 --> 03:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
in the presentation but we unfunded a
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
bunch of positions
 
03:33:04.870 --> 03:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
already um and and one of the you know
 
03:33:07.630 --> 03:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
things about the structure that we have
 
03:33:09.550 --> 03:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at it we we pull pulled to
 
03:33:12.189 --> 03:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
you know 2 million in reduction there
 
03:33:15.110 --> 03:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
and then it's up 1.2 in the next year
 
03:33:17.790 --> 03:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
and that isn't because we added people
 
03:33:20.070 --> 03:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's just structural step increases
 
03:33:24.550 --> 03:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
things like that so uh so that is our
 
03:33:26.269 --> 03:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits going on to
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
Telecom there's a savings there um you
 
03:33:32.550 --> 03:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
know about almost 700,000 each year year
 
03:33:34.990 --> 03:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
over year um that's really came from
 
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
rate card we were able to rec reduce our
 
03:33:40.389 --> 03:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
rate cards a bit and that resulted in
 
03:33:42.790 --> 03:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
some savings there on the Telecom um
 
03:33:42.800 --> 03:33:44.110 align:start position:0%
some savings there on the Telecom um
accounting

03:33:44.110 --> 03:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
03:33:49.189 --> 03:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
unit and that's that's page six um if if
 
03:33:51.389 --> 03:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
you look at the top of page seven that
 
03:33:54.269 --> 03:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
just details out the changes in in a
 
03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
narrative form but I've kind of already
 
03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
gone over that the top part of just
 
03:34:02.670 --> 03:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
Telecom is the the standard phones and
 
03:34:06.030 --> 03:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
cell phones both or uh no Telecom is
 
03:34:09.150 --> 03:34:09.160 align:start position:0%
actually the phones and the wide area
 
03:34:11.710 --> 03:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
network connections of which we have
 
03:34:16.269 --> 03:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
okay um we have over 400 connections to
 
03:34:17.990 --> 03:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
different Lo State locations and that
 
03:34:19.670 --> 03:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't if you include all of the
 
03:34:22.150 --> 03:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities and and police
 
03:34:23.990 --> 03:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
departments they're connecting it's it's
 
03:34:27.030 --> 03:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's almost a thousand total connections
 
03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
but but we aren't paying for those those
 
03:34:31.510 --> 03:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
are paid for by the the other entities
 
03:34:34.670 --> 03:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
so but they use your services well
 
03:34:36.750 --> 03:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're like for example the law
 
03:34:38.790 --> 03:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement's coming in to spots to look
 
03:34:40.710 --> 03:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
at to look up things and and the
 
03:34:43.070 --> 03:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities are interfacing with with
 
03:34:45.950 --> 03:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
um DMV for the work that gets done there
 
03:34:48.590 --> 03:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
and they're using what's called a a VPN
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
virtual private Network so they actually
 
03:34:52.229 --> 03:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
connect to our network but there's not a
 
03:34:54.550 --> 03:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
Hardline wire connect it's it's a
 
03:34:57.070 --> 03:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
virtual connection and the way those are
 
03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
structured is they're structured so that
 
03:35:00.910 --> 03:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
they can only get to the systems that
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
they need to get to they're not on the
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
entire State network but if a cyber
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
incident happens in a
 
03:35:10.349 --> 03:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
municipality we disconnect that right
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
away anyway and that happens fairly
 
03:35:14.389 --> 03:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
regularly it's a regular thing you know
 
03:35:16.349 --> 03:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's a cyber incident in a you
 
03:35:17.550 --> 03:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
know particularly if it's a ransomware
 
03:35:19.269 --> 03:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
incident in a municipality we'll
 
03:35:21.189 --> 03:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
disconnect that connection and then
 
03:35:22.990 --> 03:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
primex goes in with their remediation
 
03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
team if it's one of the primex entities
 
03:35:28.950 --> 03:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
which is almost everybody and um when
 
03:35:30.590 --> 03:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
they tell us it's safe we'll reconnect
 
03:35:32.389 --> 03:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
it again so that's kind of how that
 
03:35:35.469 --> 03:35:35.479 align:start position:0%
works that's your VPN vendor is it I V
 
03:35:38.429 --> 03:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
what that's the vendor of the VPN oh no
 
03:35:40.590 --> 03:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
primex is the risk pool manager for all
 
03:35:42.389 --> 03:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
of the for most of the cities and towns
 
03:35:45.630 --> 03:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire oh I see yeah so they
 
03:35:47.910 --> 03:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
so what happens in know if if a let's
 
03:35:52.229 --> 03:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
say a town um gets ransomed and they're
 
03:35:53.870 --> 03:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
a primex customer which almost all of
 
03:35:55.790 --> 03:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
them are or a
 
03:35:58.469 --> 03:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
school um primex sends an incident
 
03:36:00.309 --> 03:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
response team in there we communicate
 
03:36:01.950 --> 03:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
with that incident response team when
 
03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
that team says all right we've got
 
03:36:05.870 --> 03:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
everything safe now you can reconnect
 
03:36:09.269 --> 03:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
then we'll reconnect I see thank
 
03:36:12.790 --> 03:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
you the a lot of this is just analysis
 
03:36:14.950 --> 03:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
here that you could look at and and and
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
maybe find interesting but the top the
 
03:36:20.429 --> 03:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
bottom of page seven and the top of page
 
03:36:24.269 --> 03:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
eight is just the total doit budget by
 
03:36:26.229 --> 03:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
class so that's all of the accounting
 
03:36:29.189 --> 03:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
units highlighted are the areas that had
 
03:36:31.630 --> 03:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
changes that were worth
 
03:36:34.229 --> 03:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
noticing and you can see where the the
 
03:36:36.030 --> 03:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
large number of additional prioritized
 
03:36:39.150 --> 03:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
needs and what buckets they fell into
 
03:36:41.870 --> 03:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
and again most almost all of that's
 
03:36:46.630 --> 03:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
HHS um and uh and then on the bottom of
 
03:36:49.790 --> 03:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
page eight we'll we start with the
 
03:36:52.110 --> 03:36:52.120 align:start position:0%
detailing out each of the areas so your
 
03:36:54.830 --> 03:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
direct budget the bullets below it this
 
03:36:57.670 --> 03:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
is a a repeat of that table that had
 
03:37:00.189 --> 03:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
everything and the what's meaningful
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
here is just what kind of stuff is going
 
03:37:03.550 --> 03:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
on inside that budget what type of
 
03:37:06.630 --> 03:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
things are they funding with that moving
 
03:37:08.189 --> 03:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
on to page
 
03:37:13.389 --> 03:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
nine um we have um the additional
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs for um
 
03:37:20.349 --> 03:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
HHS and this is detailed out and you'll
 
03:37:22.590 --> 03:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
see later they requested that we remove
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
one of them so there's one that's off
 
03:37:28.670 --> 03:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
the table but um the rest of them are is
 
03:37:32.229 --> 03:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
what DHHS is requesting for for apn's in
 
03:37:34.830 --> 03:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:38.469 --> 03:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
Budget moving down to we we like this
 
03:37:40.590 --> 03:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
table at the bottom of page nine it kind
 
03:37:45.630 --> 03:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
of shows you where like the top
 
03:37:49.309 --> 03:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
uh seven agencies represent you know 92%
 
03:37:52.830 --> 03:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
of all of the doit budget and spend and
 
03:37:56.110 --> 03:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
you know it h HHS is at the very top it
 
03:37:59.550 --> 03:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
falls off very quickly from there um
 
03:38:01.469 --> 03:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
safety being number two and and then you
 
03:38:05.349 --> 03:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:10.389 --> 03:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
there again page 10 is our centralized
 
03:38:12.750 --> 03:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
services and again
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
we those are the things the bullets down
 
03:38:17.630 --> 03:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
below that's exact same amounts that are
 
03:38:20.030 --> 03:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
in the the summarized table earlier in
 
03:38:21.870 --> 03:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
the presentation but this details what
 
03:38:25.429 --> 03:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
we're actually supporting with those
 
03:38:29.269 --> 03:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
dollars and then the Broken Out by class
 
03:38:32.309 --> 03:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
on page 11 for the centralized and again
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
highlighting what's what's happening
 
03:38:37.710 --> 03:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
there and you can see that um you know
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
there's some some Trends downward and
 
03:38:45.790 --> 03:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
upward netting out to a a downward trend
 
03:38:48.269 --> 03:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
and again that budget is running very
 
03:38:50.309 --> 03:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
close to the edge there's no fluff there
 
03:38:53.710 --> 03:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
at all so why is there no Personnel in
 
03:38:56.469 --> 03:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
this uh the Personnel is all in a
 
03:38:58.870 --> 03:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
Accounting in a single accounting unit
 
03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
which is the next one next one I'm going
 
03:39:07.469 --> 03:39:07.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
12 so I talked to you about unfunded
 
03:39:11.520 --> 03:39:13.830 align:start position:0%
12 so I talked to you about unfunded
positions

03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
um we we right now we're carrying in
 
03:39:20.469 --> 03:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
this budget as proposed we unfunded
 
03:39:22.870 --> 03:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded a total of 39 full-time
 
03:39:25.750 --> 03:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
positions that breaks down to 37
 
03:39:28.030 --> 03:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
classified and two unclassified
 
03:39:30.630 --> 03:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
positions and it also breaks down to 14
 
03:39:33.670 --> 03:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
in the shared services and 23 direct
 
03:39:38.349 --> 03:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
support so our roughly half of our our
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
staff are supporting an agency a
 
03:39:43.870 --> 03:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated support to an agency so we
 
03:39:46.510 --> 03:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
Bild their salaries and benefit
 
03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
fully 100% to that agency the other half
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
are shared like Ken and myself we're
 
03:39:53.269 --> 03:39:53.279 align:start position:0%
allocated out by
 
03:39:55.710 --> 03:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
agency um according to a
 
03:39:59.110 --> 03:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
formula and in the case of us it's
 
03:40:01.830 --> 03:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
device count PC count the total number
 
03:40:04.269 --> 03:40:04.279 align:start position:0%
of PCS in the state divided by the
 
03:40:06.590 --> 03:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
expense then multiplied by the PC number
 
03:40:09.910 --> 03:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
of PCS that that agency has ount they
 
03:40:12.070 --> 03:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
get build
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
proportionally so it's not the um the
 
03:40:18.269 --> 03:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
dollar thing that was on this other page
 
03:40:21.469 --> 03:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
like um
 
03:40:26.429 --> 03:40:26.439 align:start position:0%
56% HHS 165% safety oh that's total
 
03:40:30.110 --> 03:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
expense yeah okay yeah but you're not
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
sort of allocating based on that no I I
 
03:40:34.590 --> 03:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
mean that's just how it comes out based
 
03:40:36.150 --> 03:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
on the allocation methods we have a
 
03:40:38.910 --> 03:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
bunch of different allocation methods or
 
03:40:41.590 --> 03:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
shared we try to we try to tailor the
 
03:40:44.469 --> 03:40:44.479 align:start position:0%
allocation method to to what makes sense
 
03:40:46.229 --> 03:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
so for us it would make sense device
 
03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
count the number of devices drives a lot
 
03:40:50.229 --> 03:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
of the activity so that kind of makes
 
03:40:52.870 --> 03:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
sense for in a generic sense but say
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's a system we're allocating out we we
 
03:40:57.070 --> 03:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
would try to allocate that out by the
 
03:41:00.189 --> 03:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
usage of the system for each agency so
 
03:41:02.710 --> 03:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
in the case of oplc for example they're
 
03:41:04.349 --> 03:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
going to pay a lot more for the
 
03:41:07.389 --> 03:41:07.399 align:start position:0%
licensing system than say um you know an
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
agency that's only has one license type
 
03:41:13.750 --> 03:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
like like lottery for example so so that
 
03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
that just it seems to make
 
03:41:21.189 --> 03:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
sense okay thank you um so the UN UNF
 
03:41:24.429 --> 03:41:24.439 align:start position:0%
funding of these positions is not in
 
03:41:27.189 --> 03:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
consequential that that um you know they
 
03:41:28.590 --> 03:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
were open positions and we were
 
03:41:31.590 --> 03:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
operating with them open but you know
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
we're we're you know you always Trend to
 
03:41:36.510 --> 03:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
a new Norm running you know 8 to 12%
 
03:41:39.389 --> 03:41:39.399 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate so we'll we'll be down and
 
03:41:41.229 --> 03:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
it based on how the budget comes out
 
03:41:42.990 --> 03:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
once we know a little bit more you know
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
later on in the process we'll be
 
03:41:44.640 --> 03:41:46.189 align:start position:0%
later on in the process we'll be
resetting

03:41:46.189 --> 03:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
resetting
 
03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
expectations to the agencies as it
 
03:41:50.550 --> 03:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
relates to this reduction uh in
 
03:41:53.469 --> 03:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
capability of doit so so all right
 
03:41:56.070 --> 03:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative lean has a question thank
 
03:41:57.110 --> 03:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
chairman so looking at your numbers as
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
far as the uh
 
03:42:05.189 --> 03:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
reducing these presently supported
 
03:42:05.199 --> 03:42:06.269 align:start position:0%
reducing these presently supported
funded

03:42:06.269 --> 03:42:06.279 align:start position:0%
funded
 
03:42:08.189 --> 03:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
positions I would have thought there'd
 
03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
be a greater decrease in your 26 and 27
 
03:42:15.670 --> 03:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
requests and I don't see that but maybe
 
03:42:21.349 --> 03:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:26.750 --> 03:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
they well yeah um the so there were to
 
03:42:29.229 --> 03:42:29.239 align:start position:0%
be fair there were already seven
 
03:42:32.349 --> 03:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
unfunded in this budget so the net is
 
03:42:35.830 --> 03:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
lower than that um but that's where it
 
03:42:39.229 --> 03:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
came out for us when we calculated it so
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
and certainly I'm
 
03:42:44.269 --> 03:42:44.279 align:start position:0%
gonna U raas this I hope Mr chairman in
 
03:42:46.469 --> 03:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
the right way but I can remember when
 
03:42:48.750 --> 03:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner Bailey was sitting in your
 
03:42:52.269 --> 03:42:52.279 align:start position:0%
seat years ago and he often would say
 
03:42:55.070 --> 03:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
well if we do this this year we should
 
03:42:57.950 --> 03:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
see a decline in expense next year The
 
03:43:00.910 --> 03:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
More We computerize Them less the cost
 
03:43:03.750 --> 03:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
but I have never seen that
 
03:43:06.389 --> 03:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
occur and it concerns me and I guess
 
03:43:10.110 --> 03:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
following up what the chair said this um
 
03:43:12.030 --> 03:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty significant increase
 
03:43:15.269 --> 03:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
here and we're facing as you well know
 
03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
huge Revenue projections negative re uh
 
03:43:19.760 --> 03:43:21.389 align:start position:0%
huge Revenue projections negative re uh
Revenue

03:43:21.389 --> 03:43:21.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
projections and on top of that I guess I
 
03:43:26.429 --> 03:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
was also looking for something we
 
03:43:29.309 --> 03:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
requested last term the general fund
 
03:43:31.309 --> 03:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
dollars I know you're an agency that
 
03:43:33.750 --> 03:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
just shows other funds but most of a lot
 
03:43:35.630 --> 03:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
of those are general fund dollars if you
 
03:43:38.070 --> 03:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
could put that together for us so sure
 
03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
what in your budget are actually general
 
03:43:42.910 --> 03:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
fund dollars that other agencies are
 
03:43:44.710 --> 03:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
providing you know I'll I'll tell you
 
03:43:48.349 --> 03:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
it'll be between 45 and
 
03:43:51.229 --> 03:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
47% General funds on this and it varies
 
03:43:53.309 --> 03:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot by agency refunding
 
03:43:55.590 --> 03:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
sources for different agencies but
 
03:43:57.750 --> 03:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's what it'll be in net total yeah
 
03:43:59.309 --> 03:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
varies by agency and that's one of the
 
03:44:01.870 --> 03:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
reasons I that drives agencies to either
 
03:44:04.149 --> 03:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
cut or not cut you see the general fund
 
03:44:06.429 --> 03:44:06.439 align:start position:0%
agencies may have been more aggressive
 
03:44:08.429 --> 03:44:08.439 align:start position:0%
on asking for their direct budgets in
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
doit to be reduced I'll talk about the
 
03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
sir the uh your question about
 
03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
implementing systems and having that
 
03:44:18.750 --> 03:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
drive cost down I mean that that was a
 
03:44:21.070 --> 03:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
thing you know
 
03:44:24.189 --> 03:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
when when back in the day when we were
 
03:44:27.389 --> 03:44:27.399 align:start position:0%
taking manual systems and implementing
 
03:44:30.070 --> 03:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
Technology Solutions to replace them
 
03:44:32.110 --> 03:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
that was absolutely a thing but not
 
03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
anymore well for the most part we're not
 
03:44:36.189 --> 03:44:36.199 align:start position:0%
replacing manual systems anymore we're
 
03:44:39.510 --> 03:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
replacing existing systems I I've yet to
 
03:44:42.189 --> 03:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
see a new system come in that was less
 
03:44:44.590 --> 03:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
expensive than the one it replaced and
 
03:44:47.389 --> 03:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
that again and goes back to the cloud
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
inflation and the fact that um you know
 
03:44:51.790 --> 03:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
there subscription based systems versus
 
03:44:51.800 --> 03:44:52.630 align:start position:0%
there subscription based systems versus
the

03:44:52.630 --> 03:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:44:56.309 --> 03:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
traditional um licensed uh you know
 
03:44:59.590 --> 03:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
Capital capitalized license purchase in
 
03:45:04.030 --> 03:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
um maintenance system so that you know
 
03:45:06.229 --> 03:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
in a in a situation where we were fully
 
03:45:08.750 --> 03:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
automating an existing manual thing I
 
03:45:10.429 --> 03:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
would expect there' be an opportunity
 
03:45:12.429 --> 03:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
and again that's at the agency level to
 
03:45:16.510 --> 03:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
start um uh start you know look at it
 
03:45:18.990 --> 03:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
and say all right can I can I hire fewer
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
people now that I have this system um
 
03:45:23.349 --> 03:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
what I'm also observing is in a lot of
 
03:45:26.469 --> 03:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
cases that that if agencies are running
 
03:45:29.469 --> 03:45:29.479 align:start position:0%
um systems and and the support of those
 
03:45:30.750 --> 03:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
systems a lot of times they they're
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
having trouble keeping up already so if
 
03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
a system marginally improved things um
 
03:45:38.030 --> 03:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
that makes that puts them in better
 
03:45:42.309 --> 03:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
stead for for uh completing their
 
03:45:45.070 --> 03:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
requirements versus some you know
 
03:45:48.630 --> 03:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:51.189 --> 03:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
savings so
 
03:45:54.429 --> 03:45:54.439 align:start position:0%
um the reason for
 
03:45:57.429 --> 03:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
upgrading if you're not getting anything
 
03:46:00.309 --> 03:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
cheaper is because the old system can no
 
03:46:03.790 --> 03:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
longer be maintained or just to get new
 
03:46:05.469 --> 03:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
features that the old system doesn't
 
03:46:07.830 --> 03:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
have so there's there's um that's
 
03:46:09.870 --> 03:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
usually it I mean I'm a big fan of
 
03:46:11.590 --> 03:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
running systems as particularly in this
 
03:46:13.189 --> 03:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
context running them as long as it's
 
03:46:15.670 --> 03:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
practical because it's a lot cheaper
 
03:46:17.309 --> 03:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
than putting a new one in both you
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
because you have the putting a new
 
03:46:20.030 --> 03:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
system in especially when you're
 
03:46:21.750 --> 03:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
replacing an old one is extremely
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
expensive just the work of getting it in
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
and then if it's actually costing you
 
03:46:28.189 --> 03:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
more to run it once it's in then you
 
03:46:30.309 --> 03:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
haven't you know you haven't benefited
 
03:46:33.429 --> 03:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of dollars but what
 
03:46:36.189 --> 03:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
you have benefited from is you have
 
03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
something that's supportable now and and
 
03:46:41.429 --> 03:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
that's what's driving it and and in most
 
03:46:43.830 --> 03:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
cases we run our systems are really long
 
03:46:46.510 --> 03:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
it'sit Broken Out by class again one of
 
03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
the things I you kind of get a sense for
 
03:46:50.950 --> 03:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
there is we're not you know the Lion
 
03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
Share of the spend there is in CL you
 
03:46:57.189 --> 03:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
know classified employees the people who
 
03:46:58.870 --> 03:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
are doing the work were not super
 
03:47:00.750 --> 03:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
topheavy you know you can see there's
 
03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
not a ton of you know comparatively
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
there's not a ton of spend in the
 
03:47:07.189 --> 03:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
unclassified space so pretty well
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
balanced in that
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
respect and uh page 15 is again Telecom
 
03:47:16.630 --> 03:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
Broken Out by class line you can see the
 
03:47:21.030 --> 03:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
the reductions there there's the one
 
03:47:22.750 --> 03:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
thing I neglected to mention both on
 
03:47:26.710 --> 03:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
page 14 and on page 15 is the additional
 
03:47:28.990 --> 03:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs I think that was rent
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
that Das asked us to put in there right
 
03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
so we I don't know what's driving that
 
03:47:36.830 --> 03:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
or what where that number came from
 
03:47:38.550 --> 03:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
other than they said put this put this
 
03:47:41.349 --> 03:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
in as as an uh additional prioritized
 
03:47:46.510 --> 03:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's it for the current Governor's
 
03:47:51.670 --> 03:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
budget if you look at page 16 you'll see
 
03:47:55.189 --> 03:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
some changes that have already occurred
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
since then um one is police standards
 
03:48:01.950 --> 03:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
and training decided to take an existing
 
03:48:04.189 --> 03:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
position reclass it so they're not
 
03:48:06.030 --> 03:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
spending actually planning on spending
 
03:48:08.550 --> 03:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
more but the police standards and
 
03:48:10.469 --> 03:48:10.479 align:start position:0%
training wants to add an IT lead they
 
03:48:12.990 --> 03:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
feel like they have enough you they're
 
03:48:15.149 --> 03:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
essentially using business folks to
 
03:48:16.389 --> 03:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
support their you know all over the
 
03:48:18.149 --> 03:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
place to support their it function so
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
they want to concentrate that into a
 
03:48:21.990 --> 03:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
single person and we're working with
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
them on
 
03:48:26.910 --> 03:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
that and uh so that's an increase we had
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
a a decrease at
 
03:48:29.279 --> 03:48:30.950 align:start position:0%
a a decrease at
Dr

03:48:30.950 --> 03:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
Dr
 
03:48:34.550 --> 03:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
um and then a u a
 
03:48:37.550 --> 03:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
corresponding decrease in agriculture
 
03:48:40.229 --> 03:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
which is an increase in the judicial
 
03:48:42.830 --> 03:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
Council and that really is for a part
 
03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
of agriculture's it lead would work for
 
03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council you know so part of
 
03:48:49.750 --> 03:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
his time would go there so they're
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
splitting which is there's precedent for
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
that like the fishing game and the
 
03:48:56.349 --> 03:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
Veterans Home are sharing an IT lead
 
03:48:58.309 --> 03:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
presently it's kind of different
 
03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
businesses huh for the same person but
 
03:49:04.429 --> 03:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
um and then uh fishing game did ask for
 
03:49:06.670 --> 03:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
reduction in their class 27 which we'll
 
03:49:09.030 --> 03:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
we'll do as part of the next you know
 
03:49:11.309 --> 03:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
this phase hopefully we can get that in
 
03:49:14.830 --> 03:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
and then the last thing was the the
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized need that HHS
 
03:49:20.590 --> 03:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
asked to re you know to remove but they
 
03:49:22.149 --> 03:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
still have all the other ones in there
 
03:49:25.269 --> 03:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
so that's it's 6 million 6.2 million
 
03:49:28.389 --> 03:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
minus this would be what you'd see for
 
03:49:29.990 --> 03:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
their additional prioritized need
 
03:49:34.510 --> 03:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
request and that kind of that that's it
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
other than the next couple pages are hb2
 
03:49:39.309 --> 03:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
requests but I'll stop for budget stuff
 
03:49:44.750 --> 03:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:46.510 --> 03:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
I think for 20 years we've been talking
 
03:49:47.830 --> 03:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
about business
 
03:49:52.070 --> 03:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
onetop do we have it yet actually uh
 
03:49:54.030 --> 03:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
Taylor caswell's group's Implement
 
03:49:56.349 --> 03:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
working on implementing the uh New
 
03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business Gateway and it's and
 
03:50:01.070 --> 03:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's looking really good that was that
 
03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
was funded with arpa arpa money and um
 
03:50:06.269 --> 03:50:06.279 align:start position:0%
we did we had a bunch of steps first
 
03:50:08.750 --> 03:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
they did that analysis with McKenzie and
 
03:50:11.070 --> 03:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
then we did a competitive procurement
 
03:50:13.990 --> 03:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
and um a deoe won that procurement and
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're implementing
 
03:50:18.030 --> 03:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
a similar solution to what Connecticut
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
did so we weren't starting from scratch
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
we have a really good project manager on
 
03:50:24.030 --> 03:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
that and and I don't know exactly where
 
03:50:26.309 --> 03:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
we are but I think we're either in
 
03:50:28.950 --> 03:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
initial pilot phase with business users
 
03:50:32.349 --> 03:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
or we're about to be live so that that's
 
03:50:34.229 --> 03:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
um I can I'll you know what I'll I'll
 
03:50:35.670 --> 03:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
get a status on that for you because I
 
03:50:37.309 --> 03:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
know you ask you ask me about it every
 
03:50:38.790 --> 03:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
time but it's really going to happen
 
03:50:40.349 --> 03:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
this time and it's it could be as long
 
03:50:42.389 --> 03:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
as 25 years that it's
 
03:50:44.790 --> 03:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
been thank you that speed of government
 
03:50:48.149 --> 03:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
on steroids I think yeah um yes no it
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
looks really good and and the project
 
03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
manager we have is has a great deal of
 
03:50:55.469 --> 03:50:55.479 align:start position:0%
expertise in uh in in Salesforce as well
 
03:50:59.630 --> 03:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
as holding our our um vendor Partners
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
accountable so they're they're right now
 
03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're running um under the we're going
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to implement more
 
03:51:07.550 --> 03:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
functionality with the same amount of
 
03:51:09.710 --> 03:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
money because of the discipline that's
 
03:51:11.229 --> 03:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
been in that project so it's pretty
 
03:51:14.990 --> 03:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
well-run project and I think the the
 
03:51:18.710 --> 03:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
that Bea has shown too it's it's really
 
03:51:20.070 --> 03:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know they have an understanding of
 
03:51:22.189 --> 03:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
how to interact with the the businesses
 
03:51:23.469 --> 03:51:23.479 align:start position:0%
stuff so I think that was a really good
 
03:51:25.269 --> 03:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
place to be running that project out of
 
03:51:27.030 --> 03:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
because their their leadership's helping
 
03:51:27.040 --> 03:51:30.510 align:start position:0%
because their their leadership's helping
a

03:51:30.510 --> 03:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:34.149 --> 03:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
lot representative Lehman yeah I guess
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
before we venture over the house bill
 
03:51:40.429 --> 03:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
tour hearing representative Wilder's
 
03:51:42.189 --> 03:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
question got me thinking back to the
 
03:51:45.389 --> 03:51:45.399 align:start position:0%
audit that we heard in fiscal while ago
 
03:51:48.189 --> 03:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
month or so ago uh one of the requests
 
03:51:48.199 --> 03:51:48.990 align:start position:0%
month or so ago uh one of the requests
was

03:51:48.990 --> 03:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:51:51.790 --> 03:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
legislation uh was required and
 
03:51:53.830 --> 03:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative wer said he'd be
 
03:51:55.590 --> 03:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
available to take that has that been
 
03:51:58.269 --> 03:51:58.279 align:start position:0%
accomplished yeah we'll we were talking
 
03:51:59.750 --> 03:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
about it today we'll get that we'll get
 
03:52:02.469 --> 03:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
some language over to you yeah I think
 
03:52:03.910 --> 03:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's one or two items that that would
 
03:52:06.510 --> 03:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
take care of and just further if I could
 
03:52:09.429 --> 03:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman U it was suggested a
 
03:52:11.630 --> 03:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan to try to take
 
03:52:14.550 --> 03:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
care of some of these U oversights
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps on your department is that have
 
03:52:18.590 --> 03:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
you got a group together or you
 
03:52:20.590 --> 03:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
developed a plan to address some of the
 
03:52:23.110 --> 03:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
concerns yeah actually we have a a plan
 
03:52:26.750 --> 03:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
for each item um and that we're uh we're
 
03:52:29.309 --> 03:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
targeting knocking those all off we
 
03:52:31.269 --> 03:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
we're slowed down a little with our our
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's most of them are in the finance
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
department so we've got we have hired a
 
03:52:36.590 --> 03:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
new Finance director we're going to get
 
03:52:39.070 --> 03:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
rolling on those but uh yes we do have a
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
plan for each item thanks thanks Mr
 
03:52:45.910 --> 03:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
chairman so I want to ask about a age in
 
03:52:48.590 --> 03:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
um so so I I wrote that I looked through
 
03:52:50.590 --> 03:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill one and looked at the
 
03:52:52.750 --> 03:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
individual agencies and how much more
 
03:52:55.590 --> 03:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
they were spending on it and the worst
 
03:53:05.630 --> 03:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:10.149 --> 03:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.389 --> 03:53:15.399 align:start position:0%
Dr okay um so Lottery is going in 2024
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
750,000 so what's what's going on with
 
03:53:26.640 --> 03:53:27.750 align:start position:0%
750,000 so what's what's going on with
that

03:53:27.750 --> 03:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:29.950 --> 03:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
one first of all I don't believe that I
 
03:53:31.910 --> 03:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't know how they H how Lottery can be
 
03:53:35.830 --> 03:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:40.510 --> 03:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
100,000 yeah worth a ID right they're
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
planning on the
 
03:53:46.349 --> 03:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
slots yeah yeah I I suspect they shifted
 
03:53:48.710 --> 03:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
some existing funds into class existing
 
03:53:51.750 --> 03:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
expenses into class 27 because we're the
 
03:53:55.030 --> 03:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
only increase that that you know so why
 
03:53:58.269 --> 03:53:58.279 align:start position:0%
is Lottery only have forly only have
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
100,000 in there because most of the
 
03:54:04.510 --> 03:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
systems are funded out not in the doit
 
03:54:07.630 --> 03:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
budget but that that looks like they
 
03:54:09.670 --> 03:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
shifted some existing funded the only
 
03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
increase they had was they're
 
03:54:12.630 --> 03:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
implementing a customer relationship
 
03:54:15.630 --> 03:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
management system in Salesforce but that
 
03:54:18.189 --> 03:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't to me that wouldn't account for
 
03:54:20.510 --> 03:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
750,000 but we we'll get I'm not going
 
03:54:23.550 --> 03:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
to try to pretend I know so I'll I'll
 
03:54:25.189 --> 03:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
get you an answer they're in a different
 
03:54:28.429 --> 03:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
division so I'd like to okay find out
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
yeah but Dr them Dr is just as bad well
 
03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
not quite just as bad well it's going
 
03:54:38.389 --> 03:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
from 800 and something to 3.8 million so
 
03:54:40.269 --> 03:54:40.279 align:start position:0%
it's an extra three million it's not as
 
03:54:43.309 --> 03:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
big a a multiplier but
 
03:54:48.070 --> 03:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:50.670 --> 03:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
number yeah yeah so it's in the
 
03:54:55.229 --> 03:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:58.870 --> 03:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
item yeah is it so this is 25 and then
 
03:55:01.469 --> 03:55:01.479 align:start position:0%
they cutting they're cutting it
 
03:55:04.229 --> 03:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
actually yeah so you're you're talking
 
03:55:07.189 --> 03:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
about class 46 the Consultants line item
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
I guess so yeah which was
 
03:55:17.149 --> 03:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
55724 and 2.2 million this year so
 
03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's for their rims
 
03:55:21.790 --> 03:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
Consultants they actually reduced it
 
03:55:25.469 --> 03:55:25.479 align:start position:0%
they reduced it for FY 26 and
 
03:55:28.590 --> 03:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
27 they reduced it from 2.2 million to
 
03:55:28.600 --> 03:55:30.389 align:start position:0%
27 they reduced it from 2.2 million to
the

03:55:30.389 --> 03:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
1.88 right and then there's another one
 
03:55:36.269 --> 03:55:36.279 align:start position:0%
and a half million of new software yeah
 
03:55:38.389 --> 03:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
and that's the that's their Rim system
 
03:55:40.030 --> 03:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
but is that the new did they move that
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
into our budget because I don't think it
 
03:55:46.670 --> 03:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
was there before yeah it it's the
 
03:55:51.229 --> 03:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
um I would I would uh have to come back
 
03:55:53.389 --> 03:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
to you with more details but I think um
 
03:55:55.550 --> 03:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
Lind uh commissioner Stepp's really in
 
03:55:57.910 --> 03:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
possession of the details of of that and
 
03:56:00.389 --> 03:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
and our it lead Karen so we can get you
 
03:56:02.309 --> 03:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
that information together make sure it's
 
03:56:04.710 --> 03:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
all explained to you but again that's a
 
03:56:07.189 --> 03:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
great example of a system that you know
 
03:56:09.990 --> 03:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
we we brought it in because the Sy the
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
old system wasn't performing well I mean
 
03:56:13.550 --> 03:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
it is doing what it's supposed to do
 
03:56:16.189 --> 03:56:16.199 align:start position:0%
which is generating more you know for
 
03:56:18.110 --> 03:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
for the effort placed it's generating
 
03:56:22.110 --> 03:56:22.120 align:start position:0%
more Revenue but um at a cost both in
 
03:56:24.750 --> 03:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the software licensing and as
 
03:56:27.149 --> 03:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
and in terms of the you know the monies
 
03:56:29.469 --> 03:56:29.479 align:start position:0%
that it requires to support it now one
 
03:56:31.950 --> 03:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
of the things that um dra has done that
 
03:56:35.550 --> 03:56:35.560 align:start position:0%
other states haven't done is they did
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
proportionately lower Consultants on
 
03:56:39.269 --> 03:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
that than other states have done most
 
03:56:42.429 --> 03:56:42.439 align:start position:0%
States when they put in a um system from
 
03:56:44.790 --> 03:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
fast that's the name of the company fast
 
03:56:49.110 --> 03:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
systems they staff it all with fast
 
03:56:51.910 --> 03:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
Consultants at a you know huge cost and
 
03:56:54.149 --> 03:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
and what commissioner Stepp's done is
 
03:56:56.110 --> 03:56:56.120 align:start position:0%
balance that having some fast
 
03:56:59.070 --> 03:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
Consultants but also having the doit and
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
the Dr team support a lot of the
 
03:57:03.510 --> 03:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
functions that a fast consultant might
 
03:57:05.349 --> 03:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
be supporting in other
 
03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
states but we'll get we'll we'll follow
 
03:57:12.149 --> 03:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
up with details on both the Dr and the
 
03:57:14.950 --> 03:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
lottery okay I
 
03:57:17.269 --> 03:57:17.279 align:start position:0%
mean there's several others that have
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
big increases on this list uh military
 
03:57:24.510 --> 03:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
Das um
 
03:57:24.520 --> 03:57:26.389 align:start position:0%
Das um
oplc

03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
03:57:28.550 --> 03:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
pu etc etc so
 
03:57:34.990 --> 03:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
um we'll we'll get we'll we'll go
 
03:57:37.149 --> 03:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
through it we'll find them all and we'll
 
03:57:38.990 --> 03:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
get you we'll get you a narrative for
 
03:57:41.510 --> 03:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
each one all right thank you um now you
 
03:57:43.030 --> 03:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to you had a few minutes you
 
03:57:46.750 --> 03:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about how two
 
03:57:50.590 --> 03:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so House Bill
 
03:57:50.600 --> 03:57:52.870 align:start position:0%
yeah so House Bill
two

03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:57:58.149 --> 03:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
um all right so the um a while back we
 
03:58:01.389 --> 03:58:01.399 align:start position:0%
established a Chief privacy officer and
 
03:58:03.149 --> 03:58:03.159 align:start position:0%
what we discovered afterwards that we
 
03:58:05.429 --> 03:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
didn't have the you know we did did only
 
03:58:07.070 --> 03:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
part of the work there's two steps one
 
03:58:08.990 --> 03:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
is getting the position established the
 
03:58:11.349 --> 03:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
second is actually getting it in into
 
03:58:14.590 --> 03:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
legislation so that it it that um so
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
that this would cover that although we
 
03:58:18.070 --> 03:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
don't have the money in the budget to
 
03:58:20.750 --> 03:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
fund it but I mean I think it would we
 
03:58:22.910 --> 03:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
should get this done so if some at some
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
point we can afford a Chief privacy
 
03:58:26.590 --> 03:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
officer we could we could fill that
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
position so no one is currently
 
03:58:31.790 --> 03:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
hired no
 
03:58:34.389 --> 03:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay no we we have it's one of the
 
03:58:35.429 --> 03:58:35.439 align:start position:0%
positions we
 
03:58:39.110 --> 03:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
unfunded okay yeah and and during this
 
03:58:41.349 --> 03:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
bium so far we for a while we were
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
running a pretty low vacancy rate so um
 
03:58:45.120 --> 03:58:46.189 align:start position:0%
running a pretty low vacancy rate so um
we

03:58:46.189 --> 03:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:58:48.510 --> 03:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
actually didn't have the money to hire
 
03:58:51.550 --> 03:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
it even if we it was fully
 
03:58:51.560 --> 03:58:53.269 align:start position:0%
it even if we it was fully
authorized

03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
03:58:53.279 --> 03:58:55.389 align:start position:0%
authorized
um

03:58:55.389 --> 03:58:55.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:59.510 --> 03:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the second one is it's been in
 
03:59:01.189 --> 03:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
place for I think this will be the third
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
bium if this should it pass it allows us
 
03:59:08.349 --> 03:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
to strategically adjust who we hire so
 
03:59:10.349 --> 03:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
if somebody so the way I un I'll give
 
03:59:11.950 --> 03:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
you a great example the way I unfunded
 
03:59:14.189 --> 03:59:14.199 align:start position:0%
positions wasn't This brilliant
 
03:59:16.990 --> 03:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
strategic plan on my part it was what
 
03:59:18.950 --> 03:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
positions were open that might not have
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
been the smartest way to do it so this
 
03:59:23.309 --> 03:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
allows us during the next bium should it
 
03:59:26.269 --> 03:59:26.279 align:start position:0%
pass to adjust over time to make sure
 
03:59:27.950 --> 03:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're putting the money at the highest
 
03:59:30.309 --> 03:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
priority so it's a really I think this
 
03:59:31.790 --> 03:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
is a really smart thing to do and it's
 
03:59:33.309 --> 03:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
not like we're going to spend more money
 
03:59:34.670 --> 03:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
we we're just going to do a better job
 
03:59:37.030 --> 03:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
with the money we have so that's the net
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
of that one and then the last one this
 
03:59:42.309 --> 03:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
is an audit finding fix that we talked
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
about at the fiscal the other day so
 
03:59:46.229 --> 03:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
that's the one I mentioned so that that
 
03:59:48.110 --> 03:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
corrects one of the findings already and
 
03:59:50.790 --> 03:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
I'll we'll get you language uh chairman
 
03:59:54.349 --> 03:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
wer for the for the others that we had
 
03:59:54.359 --> 03:59:56.429 align:start position:0%
wer for the for the others that we had
in

03:59:56.429 --> 03:59:56.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:59:59.630 --> 03:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
mind okay and that's concludes our
 
04:00:01.349 --> 04:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
presentation so there's these are all
 
04:00:03.550 --> 04:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
things you want in house bill to but no
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
no they're they're in there oh these are
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
all in I see yeah
 
04:00:11.309 --> 04:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
we okay we had sent this in and they
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
they put well as far as I know they're
 
04:00:14.830 --> 04:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
in there I hasn't been published yet I
 
04:00:18.110 --> 04:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't think but um all right
 
04:00:18.120 --> 04:00:20.510 align:start position:0%
don't think but um all right
representative

04:00:20.510 --> 04:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
Griffin I was looking at class 42
 
04:00:28.149 --> 04:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
042 uh additional fringe benefits I
 
04:00:30.790 --> 04:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
wondered what that
 
04:00:35.349 --> 04:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:38.189 --> 04:00:38.199 align:start position:0%
page seven
 
04:00:42.149 --> 04:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
14 uh 14 near the end well it's that's
 
04:00:45.149 --> 04:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
included in every that's included in any
 
04:00:48.349 --> 04:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that has
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
personnel and it's part of the total
 
04:00:52.070 --> 04:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
benefits package I'm I'm not sure
 
04:00:56.269 --> 04:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is but every every um
 
04:00:58.149 --> 04:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that has in the state
 
04:01:01.110 --> 04:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
that has staff has
 
04:01:03.590 --> 04:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
that it's not something we just get a
 
04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
formula from d and that drives what we
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
put in there Melissa do you know one
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
explanation I heard once was the um
 
04:01:15.389 --> 04:01:15.399 align:start position:0%
people that retire hred from your
 
04:01:18.389 --> 04:01:18.399 align:start position:0%
agency it's not enough in the retirement
 
04:01:20.550 --> 04:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
system to cover them so they throw it in
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
the agency they retired from that was
 
04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
one explanation I heard some time ago
 
04:01:26.750 --> 04:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I it's it's a good question
 
04:01:28.830 --> 04:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the ones we don't think
 
04:01:30.349 --> 04:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
about very much because we just get
 
04:01:32.349 --> 04:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
formulas from dask and then we put in
 
04:01:36.309 --> 04:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
what they tell us to put in but can can
 
04:01:39.870 --> 04:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
we get a followup on that can Melissa
 
04:01:42.870 --> 04:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so additional FR uh fringe
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
benefits representative W wer you're
 
04:01:46.950 --> 04:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
close on that so it is for
 
04:01:48.950 --> 04:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
postretirement it's a way for the
 
04:01:51.030 --> 04:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
general fund to claw back these
 
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
retirement funds from other funded
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
agencies so it is a Formula that Das
 
04:01:57.630 --> 04:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
gives them and anybody who is not a
 
04:02:00.670 --> 04:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
general funded agency but has retirement
 
04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
benefits as your employees do this is
 
04:02:04.750 --> 04:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
the that this is the line where it
 
04:02:04.760 --> 04:02:05.830 align:start position:0%
the that this is the line where it
covers

04:02:05.830 --> 04:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
covers
 
04:02:09.990 --> 04:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:16.189 --> 04:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:18.349 --> 04:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so what you're saying is this is
 
04:02:21.189 --> 04:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
payments that come out of das's general
 
04:02:24.630 --> 04:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
fund budget but might go to somebody who
 
04:02:28.189 --> 04:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
was lottery funded or something else
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
right and and this is a way of having
 
04:02:33.309 --> 04:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
that fund pay back the general f yeah
 
04:02:35.469 --> 04:02:35.479 align:start position:0%
like an in agency transfer way for it to
 
04:02:37.550 --> 04:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
CL back into the general fund got thank
 
04:02:40.910 --> 04:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome right other questions
 
04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative you so I know you're
 
04:02:44.149 --> 04:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
going to follow up and get get the
 
04:02:45.870 --> 04:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
information and we don't have to do a
 
04:02:47.830 --> 04:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
guessing game but when we were talking
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
about the Consultants line bumping up I
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
remembered when uh Lindsay was here we
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
were talking about rims and it had been
 
04:02:59.349 --> 04:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
covered through the capital budget and
 
04:03:01.750 --> 04:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
so what it I'm I'm looking at her
 
04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
handout here it says seven-year contract
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
expires on December 31st
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
2025 Dr expects to enter into three
 
04:03:13.229 --> 04:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
threeyear extensions at the conclusion
 
04:03:15.670 --> 04:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
of the initial contract then it says
 
04:03:17.870 --> 04:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing hardware and software support
 
04:03:20.269 --> 04:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
and maintenance will need to transition
 
04:03:24.469 --> 04:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
into dr's operating budget so is that
 
04:03:26.830 --> 04:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that that that explain yeah that
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me because um because
 
04:03:32.070 --> 04:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
everything she had people hired and
 
04:03:34.710 --> 04:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
whatever everything had been through the
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
operating budget so now she's going to
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
transfer Ty I mean the capital budget
 
04:03:41.630 --> 04:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
it's okay you know once you're once
 
04:03:44.309 --> 04:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
you're done implementing
 
04:03:46.590 --> 04:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
um then you then it's appropriate that
 
04:03:49.389 --> 04:03:49.399 align:start position:0%
it transition off of a one-time funding
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
source into a ongoing operating expense
 
04:03:54.990 --> 04:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so because I remember her talking
 
04:03:56.429 --> 04:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that's happening at
 
04:03:58.790 --> 04:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
at fast systems on the rim system is
 
04:04:01.790 --> 04:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
that they're they're evolving the the
 
04:04:03.710 --> 04:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
software as well so they have some
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
expense I think they'll have expenses
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
and do have expenses related to keeping
 
04:04:10.750 --> 04:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
up with the latest versions and things
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
like that and and there'll be uh some
 
04:04:17.110 --> 04:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
some work and expense in the future to
 
04:04:19.309 --> 04:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
you know when at some point when fast
 
04:04:22.229 --> 04:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
systems decides to no longer support a
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
on premise version of their software
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
they'll be you know I don't I don't know
 
04:04:27.870 --> 04:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
if that's in this bium or in a future
 
04:04:31.030 --> 04:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
bium but they'll there'll be a time when
 
04:04:33.870 --> 04:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
that system has to transition into their
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
Cloud environment versus the right now
 
04:04:37.349 --> 04:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
that system is sitting in our data
 
04:04:40.269 --> 04:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
center at 27
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
Hazen are there other agencies whose uh
 
04:04:45.590 --> 04:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
software is on the ropes that we're
 
04:04:48.670 --> 04:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
going to have to be um absolutely yeah
 
04:04:50.710 --> 04:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely and that's one of the
 
04:04:52.149 --> 04:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
interesting things that comes up at the
 
04:04:53.710 --> 04:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
executive counsil right they'd like us
 
04:04:55.389 --> 04:04:55.399 align:start position:0%
to rebid everything right they don't
 
04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
like Soul Source but Soul sourcing these
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of these contracts is the absolute
 
04:05:02.670 --> 04:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
least expensive way to do things because
 
04:05:04.429 --> 04:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
you you repr procure and then you have
 
04:05:06.469 --> 04:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
that giant implementation Cost Plus a
 
04:05:07.750 --> 04:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
new system that's probably going to be
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
more expensive than the old one because
 
04:05:11.830 --> 04:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
nothing's going down so we'll be we'll
 
04:05:13.790 --> 04:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
be facing that challenge you know
 
04:05:16.469 --> 04:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
talking about system Soul Source
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
contracts we're bringing before the
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
executive counsil as as that
 
04:05:25.469 --> 04:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
occurs but they um but you know what one
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
of the things where we work on each bium
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
with each agency is there um their
 
04:05:33.670 --> 04:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
Agency information technology plan aitp
 
04:05:35.950 --> 04:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
which is required by Statute that the
 
04:05:38.870 --> 04:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
agency do we work with them very closely
 
04:05:42.189 --> 04:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
to get it done and and and what we like
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
to see in there is what are there plans
 
04:05:45.990 --> 04:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
for their application portfolio
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
especially for their critical
 
04:05:50.910 --> 04:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
applications and and um you know what
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
are the drivers and what what has to get
 
04:05:54.990 --> 04:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
done and in what time frame particularly
 
04:05:59.110 --> 04:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
if they have a end of life product so if
 
04:06:02.469 --> 04:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
if a if you're in a regulated industry
 
04:06:04.830 --> 04:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
you know data is regulated by some
 
04:06:06.750 --> 04:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
federal agency or the payment card
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
industry and the software vendor
 
04:06:13.550 --> 04:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
announces end of life then you have
 
04:06:15.790 --> 04:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
eventually you're backed into a corner
 
04:06:18.309 --> 04:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
you have to go to their latest version
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
or you have to repr procure and
 
04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes going to their latest version
 
04:06:25.189 --> 04:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
is just as difficult as getting a new
 
04:06:27.469 --> 04:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
one so we each time that has to be
 
04:06:29.389 --> 04:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
re-evaluated for each application
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
there's no one right answer for
 
04:06:35.189 --> 04:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
that one other question um I don't know
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
if you can answer this but just um
 
04:06:40.750 --> 04:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
looking ahead a little bit in hb2
 
04:06:43.790 --> 04:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
there's um some big changes going going
 
04:06:45.309 --> 04:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
on as far as
 
04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
permitting um with Dees and fishing game
 
04:06:53.229 --> 04:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
and dncr is that going to involve
 
04:06:58.469 --> 04:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
soft a lot of it type expense or or
 
04:07:00.510 --> 04:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you're not ready to talk about I I
 
04:07:02.710 --> 04:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
I guess that it it will involve some
 
04:07:05.110 --> 04:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
work um but I I haven't seen the
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
language so I I don't okay on my uh
 
04:07:10.269 --> 04:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
paper here fish and games it costs are
 
04:07:11.229 --> 04:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
going up
 
04:07:14.389 --> 04:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
150% so
 
04:07:17.710 --> 04:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
is that without hb2 though or I wonder
 
04:07:19.870 --> 04:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
anyway we may see you again in that
 
04:07:21.910 --> 04:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
conversation yeah so it's going to be
 
04:07:26.630 --> 04:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
here yeah well happy to come down and
 
04:08:12.429 --> 04:08:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:12.439 --> 04:08:42.429 align:start position:0%
 
mhm

04:08:42.429 --> 04:08:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:42.439 --> 04:09:12.349 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:12.359 --> 04:09:42.309 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:09:42.309 --> 04:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:42.319 --> 04:10:12.309 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:10:12.309 --> 04:10:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:12.319 --> 04:10:42.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:42.239 --> 04:11:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:12.239 --> 04:11:42.229 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:13.920 --> 04:12:16.389 align:start position:0%
 
started

04:12:16.389 --> 04:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
started
 
04:12:18.990 --> 04:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
here um because we we only have half an
 
04:12:21.950 --> 04:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
hour so let's get
 
04:12:29.630 --> 04:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
152 all
 
04:12:34.269 --> 04:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
right so
 
04:12:38.189 --> 04:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
152 it's the last page of the treasury
 
04:12:40.750 --> 04:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
and so we will Rec
 
04:12:44.189 --> 04:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
recognize uh Treasurer m
 
04:12:47.149 --> 04:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
hello and um you know we're we're
 
04:12:49.109 --> 04:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in in your
 
04:12:52.269 --> 04:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
Agency for the same reason that uh
 
04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
Willie Sutton was interested in Banks
 
04:12:55.469 --> 04:12:55.479 align:start position:0%
right I
 
04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
mean that's where the money is
 
04:13:02.109 --> 04:13:02.119 align:start position:0%
so um I see you have a whole
 
04:13:04.269 --> 04:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
presentation here but I I have a long
 
04:13:06.750 --> 04:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
list of questions for half an hour so
 
04:13:09.070 --> 04:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you mind if I just kind
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
of jump
 
04:13:14.670 --> 04:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
into because I think um we'll probably
 
04:13:17.309 --> 04:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
get to a lot of the presentation as we
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
go um so number one you're you're adding
 
04:13:24.550 --> 04:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
a position yes um are there any vacant
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
positions or unfunded
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
positions good afternoon um chairman and
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
State Treasurer Monica mapelli no uh
 
04:13:35.510 --> 04:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
right now we're very fortunate we don't
 
04:13:39.870 --> 04:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
have vacancies and um that is a request
 
04:13:42.349 --> 04:13:42.359 align:start position:0%
um for an entry level accounting
 
04:13:42.359 --> 04:13:43.590 align:start position:0%
um for an entry level accounting
position

04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:13:46.030 --> 04:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
and the reason
 
04:13:48.750 --> 04:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
um understanding the current situation
 
04:13:51.109 --> 04:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
the reason we uh requested that position
 
04:13:53.710 --> 04:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
is because of the anticipated work that
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
we see um um that will come with the um
 
04:14:01.389 --> 04:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
upgrade of the financial
 
04:14:04.750 --> 04:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
system uh we see um we see some changes
 
04:14:06.670 --> 04:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
happening so we're we're actually
 
04:14:08.910 --> 04:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
transfering some positions from one
 
04:14:10.870 --> 04:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
division to another but this particular
 
04:14:13.710 --> 04:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
position will assist with the
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 um custodial in trust
 
04:14:20.269 --> 04:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
accounts that we going to uh begin
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
accounting properly and accounting
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
system right now those accounts are in
 
04:14:26.109 --> 04:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets as we I think I mentioned
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
in in in other meetings um I have
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
attended um it is a Time the state
 
04:14:35.229 --> 04:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
accounts for those um um those that
 
04:14:37.870 --> 04:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
activity properly and so we plan to do
 
04:14:40.750 --> 04:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
that and so that will just um create
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
additional work for that business office
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
so um I'm um respectfully requesting
 
04:14:48.349 --> 04:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
that position understanding that that
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
could be obviously um reconsidered but
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's the reason for the request
 
04:14:54.990 --> 04:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
and Which accounting unit is that in
 
04:14:58.670 --> 04:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:58.680 --> 04:15:00.189 align:start position:0%
 
1050

04:15:00.189 --> 04:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
1050
 
04:15:04.990 --> 04:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
okay great um now on this page you can
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
see a problem that also appears on page
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
141 if you look at other funds and
 
04:15:14.750 --> 04:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
fiscally year
 
04:15:18.750 --> 04:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
2025 so the meals and rooms tax
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
distribution to uh
 
04:15:27.149 --> 04:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
towns disappeared from that
 
04:15:31.229 --> 04:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
line that is correct so um the meals um
 
04:15:33.070 --> 04:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
the meals and room stock distribution
 
04:15:36.189 --> 04:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
was not budgeted during the last bium um
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
we had included in the agency budget and
 
04:15:41.630 --> 04:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
I think the house um included it as well
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
but the Senate removed it so so it was
 
04:15:45.670 --> 04:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
no longer part of the budget however
 
04:15:47.790 --> 04:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
it's the activity stayed because we had
 
04:15:51.109 --> 04:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
to pay um the distribution to the
 
04:15:52.990 --> 04:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
municipality so you don't see it in the
 
04:15:54.590 --> 04:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
budget but if you see the accounting
 
04:15:56.269 --> 04:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
system you will see that activity right
 
04:15:59.030 --> 04:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
now so that was 136
 
04:16:03.030 --> 04:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
million um the agency budget for it was
 
04:16:09.630 --> 04:16:09.640 align:start position:0%
136 million 136 million in FIS year 25
 
04:16:12.429 --> 04:16:12.439 align:start position:0%
gotcha so it is increasing about 2% and
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
26 in about 4% and
 
04:16:15.760 --> 04:16:17.309 align:start position:0%
26 in about 4% and
27

04:16:17.309 --> 04:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
27
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
right and obviously we will substitute
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
our own meals and rooms tax estimates
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
for these numbers right so um okay so
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
and it was just taken out just to make
 
04:16:33.389 --> 04:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
the budget look smaller is that is that
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
what we think yeah okay all right yeah
 
04:16:39.710 --> 04:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
we don't know okay good well
 
04:16:44.830 --> 04:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
that oh sure sure I understand okay
 
04:16:46.590 --> 04:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll do it again right who
 
04:16:50.950 --> 04:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
knows okay um now back to page
 
04:16:57.790 --> 04:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
152 um it looks like um some of
 
04:17:02.910 --> 04:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
these um numbers are kind of creeping up
 
04:17:06.670 --> 04:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
152 yeah this is just the grand totals
 
04:17:09.149 --> 04:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
here right
 
04:17:09.159 --> 04:17:10.870 align:start position:0%
here right
um

04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:14.830 --> 04:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
so expens
 
04:17:16.750 --> 04:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
let me see
 
04:17:20.670 --> 04:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
here yeah it go ahead what I was going
 
04:17:23.550 --> 04:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
to say is um you may see some again um
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
so I mentioned just briefly um we made
 
04:17:29.309 --> 04:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
some transfers so there were we transfer
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
three positions from different divisions
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
or accounting units to um the um
 
04:17:39.870 --> 04:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
treasury operations accounting unit and
 
04:17:42.149 --> 04:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
that's again because of the anticipated
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
changes that were we seeing coming with
 
04:17:46.670 --> 04:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
the conversion of the accounting system
 
04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh with that what we're trying to do
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
obviously we're trying to um take
 
04:17:52.030 --> 04:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of all the of new
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
functionality that is coming with the
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
system right now there are two positions
 
04:17:58.469 --> 04:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
um there are in the office of investment
 
04:18:01.630 --> 04:18:01.640 align:start position:0%
and Deb management that um they what
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
they do is approve cash receipts all of
 
04:18:07.030 --> 04:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
them so um Our intention is to combine
 
04:18:09.070 --> 04:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
that with the reconciliation unit so
 
04:18:11.910 --> 04:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
they can only do reconciliation and not
 
04:18:13.510 --> 04:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
do it twice so right now we're trying to
 
04:18:16.149 --> 04:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
simplify that so we're um again it's
 
04:18:16.159 --> 04:18:17.670 align:start position:0%
simplify that so we're um again it's
unclear

04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
unclear
 
04:18:19.750 --> 04:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
how when we're going to see some of
 
04:18:20.990 --> 04:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
those efficiencies so right now we're
 
04:18:23.630 --> 04:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
just transferring um employees from one
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
place to another and and you and that
 
04:18:27.070 --> 04:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
may be the reason why you're seeing some
 
04:18:29.149 --> 04:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
increases in some accounting units
 
04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
because in total the general fund did
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
not increase the only area that was not
 
04:18:38.910 --> 04:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
so we met the governor's budget of um um
 
04:18:41.309 --> 04:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
decreases of 4% with the exception of
 
04:18:43.030 --> 04:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
that service just because we did not
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
include that service in that in that um
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
in that request but everything else was
 
04:18:51.269 --> 04:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
a reduction of the general fund okay
 
04:18:55.229 --> 04:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
let's talk about um B the big stuff so
 
04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
like general
 
04:19:02.469 --> 04:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
fund roughly 80 million a year uh 24 25
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
26 down to 75 and then
 
04:19:08.309 --> 04:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
27 up to
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
85 so is that simply shifting things
 
04:19:14.429 --> 04:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
from year to year or did something did
 
04:19:16.469 --> 04:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
the governor somehow take away something
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
in the general funds in 26 so Deb
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
service will be The Driver of any
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
increases um the Deb service okay Debt
 
04:19:27.870 --> 04:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
Service funded with General funds which
 
04:19:30.910 --> 04:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
is on
 
04:19:37.870 --> 04:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
143 so Debt
 
04:19:42.990 --> 04:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
Service um
 
04:19:45.469 --> 04:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
includes our existing Debt Service and
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
also we are assuming that we will bond
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
approximately 60 million each year with
 
04:19:55.030 --> 04:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
the exception of now fisc year 26 so in
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
fisc year 26 we anticipate we're going
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
to bond an additional 40 million for the
 
04:20:03.309 --> 04:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
prison again that was approved last
 
04:20:06.550 --> 04:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
during the last legislative session so
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
normally our assumptions are about 60
 
04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
million each year but for that we're
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
going to bump it to 100
 
04:20:16.790 --> 04:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
um so um that's actually how we
 
04:20:18.670 --> 04:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
initially prepare those those
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
assumptions those calculations uh when I
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
spoke to the governor's office they
 
04:20:25.510 --> 04:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned an amount of about 130 million
 
04:20:29.229 --> 04:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
for the capital budget uh but now it it
 
04:20:31.630 --> 04:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
looks like it's the capital budget um
 
04:20:33.950 --> 04:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
funded with General funds is 140 million
 
04:20:36.790 --> 04:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that I I I have for
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
you today is a recalculation of that
 
04:20:41.109 --> 04:20:41.119 align:start position:0%
debt service and fiscal year 27
 
04:20:45.109 --> 04:20:45.119 align:start position:0%
increases above by approximately 550,000
 
04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
have that uh revision if you want to
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
consider again if that that is if that
 
04:20:57.030 --> 04:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
is if the house and the Senate um if the
 
04:20:58.630 --> 04:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
budget the recommended budget is
 
04:21:00.389 --> 04:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
approved the way it is right
 
04:21:03.990 --> 04:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
now um so why
 
04:21:06.790 --> 04:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
is why is the death service for fisol
 
04:21:09.149 --> 04:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
year 26 so different from
 
04:21:12.790 --> 04:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
27 because when we Bond so so for
 
04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
example right now I just we just defer
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
the the 40 million to next year so we're
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
not right now we're ready to to in a
 
04:21:21.309 --> 04:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
couple in a few weeks we're going to
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
issue bonds um those are fiscal year 25
 
04:21:26.590 --> 04:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
bonds so you won't see any activity any
 
04:21:30.030 --> 04:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
Debt Service until the foll fiscal year
 
04:21:32.349 --> 04:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what we're by deferring
 
04:21:34.910 --> 04:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
the 40 million to FIS year 27
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
essentially the increase in thatb
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
service is going to be reflected in fisc
 
04:21:38.880 --> 04:21:40.309 align:start position:0%
service is going to be reflected in fisc
year

04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:21:42.630 --> 04:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
27 but the difference is nothing like
 
04:21:46.189 --> 04:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
like 40 million it's only 9 million is
 
04:21:48.670 --> 04:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
the debt service is not the 40 million
 
04:21:51.269 --> 04:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
is it's um oh
 
04:21:54.229 --> 04:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
I the 40 million is what was approved so
 
04:21:55.870 --> 04:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to start bonding that and
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
then that service will start increasing
 
04:22:01.349 --> 04:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
based on that over the next 20
 
04:22:03.990 --> 04:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
years okay I thought we were doing 40
 
04:22:07.309 --> 04:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
million a year not 40 million once for
 
04:22:09.910 --> 04:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
buying oh I don't believe that has
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
passed so that's um I see that's not um
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
so this is related to what's in the
 
04:22:18.309 --> 04:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
governor's version of the capital budget
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's actually what was passed during the
 
04:22:23.349 --> 04:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
last legislative session so that was uh
 
04:22:27.389 --> 04:22:27.399 align:start position:0%
approved in um 2024 so that's already
 
04:22:29.269 --> 04:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
approved and passed that's what we're
 
04:22:31.630 --> 04:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
including in this
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
budget now was now what has not been
 
04:22:37.550 --> 04:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
considered haven't been issued yet oh
 
04:22:40.229 --> 04:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
they haven't borrowed the 40 million we
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
something from trying to remember who
 
04:22:45.109 --> 04:22:45.119 align:start position:0%
told me this but they've got like 50
 
04:22:47.149 --> 04:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
million set aside and they still haven't
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
got all the contracts approved for the
 
04:22:52.269 --> 04:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
planning and the plan and all this stuff
 
04:22:55.510 --> 04:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
and that 50 million May cover it so we
 
04:22:58.830 --> 04:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
may not know exactly how many how much
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
expensive this prison will be with an
 
04:23:05.349 --> 04:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
initial Assumption of 400 million but
 
04:23:07.870 --> 04:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
okay they've accumulated 50 million they
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
still got a lot of work to do they've
 
04:23:11.870 --> 04:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
got to get approval for the site they're
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to do sces and so on of it and and
 
04:23:16.510 --> 04:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
all that sort of stuff for the priest
 
04:23:19.229 --> 04:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
stuff and then go out and get an an
 
04:23:21.870 --> 04:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
architect to design within that
 
04:23:24.149 --> 04:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
footprint or whatever they end up with
 
04:23:26.510 --> 04:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
so this could be a lengthy thing and
 
04:23:28.750 --> 04:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we might not even need to borrow
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
the 40 million in the second year if
 
04:23:35.710 --> 04:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to take them 17 18 20 months
 
04:23:38.429 --> 04:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
to even get ready to to have brown
 
04:23:40.030 --> 04:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
breaking all right so let's ask the
 
04:23:42.070 --> 04:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
question the other way if we did not
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
borrow 40 million what would change here
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
it would be the amount in FIS year
 
04:23:51.269 --> 04:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
27 it will
 
04:23:54.550 --> 04:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
be um it will be a lot less it will be
 
04:23:56.870 --> 04:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
close to what's in the 26
 
04:23:59.550 --> 04:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
budget okay we're saving the debt the
 
04:24:02.830 --> 04:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
debt payment not the 40 million correct
 
04:24:05.910 --> 04:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
bonded but the amount you'd have to pay
 
04:24:07.950 --> 04:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
every year for the bond correct the
 
04:24:09.790 --> 04:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
authorization has been that has been
 
04:24:11.790 --> 04:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
already approved so if they're not ready
 
04:24:14.070 --> 04:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
to bond anything then we'll just defer
 
04:24:15.950 --> 04:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
that payment until they're ready to
 
04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
spend the money we will only Bond when
 
04:24:22.109 --> 04:24:22.119 align:start position:0%
they spend the money not before I see so
 
04:24:26.309 --> 04:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
this is not about this year's uh House
 
04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
Bill 25 right this was already in a
 
04:24:32.750 --> 04:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
previous it it's a combination of of
 
04:24:34.670 --> 04:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
It's a combination so it's existing that
 
04:24:37.309 --> 04:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
service uh funds have been approved not
 
04:24:39.990 --> 04:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
and and not issued yet and then what we
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
anticipate is going to be part of um the
 
04:24:44.830 --> 04:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
capital budget so if the capital budget
 
04:24:48.309 --> 04:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
approves um again right now it's 140
 
04:24:51.070 --> 04:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
million so I imagine a portion of that
 
04:24:55.149 --> 04:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
will be spent and budgeted in 26 and 27
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay but borrowing 40 why does that
 
04:25:02.469 --> 04:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
cause a one-ear increase in payments of
 
04:25:07.269 --> 04:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
nine I mean isn't that way high no well
 
04:25:08.510 --> 04:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
that that's the calculation and we
 
04:25:09.950 --> 04:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
assume they're going to spend the entire
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
40 million I mean I don't really know if
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
if they will spend a portion or not but
 
04:25:17.189 --> 04:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
typically um for something like that and
 
04:25:19.630 --> 04:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
we we don't know the details we just
 
04:25:22.830 --> 04:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
include the I guess worst case scenario
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
but you pay it off over what period of
 
04:25:27.950 --> 04:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
time the 40 minut it will be uh a period
 
04:25:30.590 --> 04:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
of 20 years amortization of 20 years so
 
04:25:32.670 --> 04:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
you're not going to pay 9 million a year
 
04:25:36.149 --> 04:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
for 20 years to to borrow 40 now that
 
04:25:38.269 --> 04:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense sometimes The Upfront
 
04:25:43.309 --> 04:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:43.319 --> 04:25:44.910 align:start position:0%
 
they

04:25:44.910 --> 04:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:25:48.229 --> 04:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
are it just doesn't make sense to me
 
04:25:50.510 --> 04:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
so well can you make like an
 
04:25:53.429 --> 04:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
amortization schedule or something I can
 
04:25:56.590 --> 04:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
I don't have it here right now but I can
 
04:25:58.950 --> 04:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
certainly show you how that looks like
 
04:26:01.870 --> 04:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
yes definitely okay um and and we're
 
04:26:03.750 --> 04:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
going to see Corrections a week from
 
04:26:06.790 --> 04:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:10.950 --> 04:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
Melissa Friday okay can we have a page
 
04:26:13.790 --> 04:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
for that day that shows what's going on
 
04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
with the new Men's prison both
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
operating expenses and capital budget
 
04:26:22.910 --> 04:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
expenses okay yeah thank
 
04:26:26.030 --> 04:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
you representative yeah in that could
 
04:26:27.790 --> 04:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
could we just clar so I think there was
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
10 million doll
 
04:26:32.349 --> 04:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the last budget and then
 
04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
there was the additional 40 but the 40
 
04:26:37.229 --> 04:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
was also in the operating budget but it
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
was set to be amortized it wasn't in the
 
04:26:43.990 --> 04:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
capital budget I think that's I think
 
04:26:45.429 --> 04:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
mechanically they they're going to have
 
04:26:47.109 --> 04:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
to do something to move it to the
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
capital budget because it's a capital
 
04:26:51.189 --> 04:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
expenditure you have a conversation I
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
think that's how it how it worked and I
 
04:26:54.790 --> 04:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
did I mean just for what it's worth I
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
did look at the capital budget because I
 
04:26:58.790 --> 04:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
was wondering what they were doing about
 
04:27:02.550 --> 04:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
this and it's just more maintenance in
 
04:27:06.070 --> 04:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
there they don't have right yeah
 
04:27:08.429 --> 04:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
right yeah it's a
 
04:27:11.830 --> 04:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
lot um can I just ask Mr chair you
 
04:27:14.269 --> 04:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
usually do a debt affordability study
 
04:27:17.149 --> 04:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
for the public works have you already
 
04:27:19.469 --> 04:27:19.479 align:start position:0%
done that yes we it's ready right now I
 
04:27:20.710 --> 04:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
was posted on the website but I can
 
04:27:23.109 --> 04:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
certainly share that with you um yeah
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
that would be really helpful yes
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you you're welcome all
 
04:27:43.550 --> 04:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:47.309 --> 04:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
so it's cheated property is what
 
04:27:49.990 --> 04:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
um this funds that been as cheated to
 
04:27:52.229 --> 04:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
the general fund but because we have to
 
04:27:58.149 --> 04:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
pay um regardless of um if if if the
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
rightful owner of that property can come
 
04:28:03.229 --> 04:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
to us and request um and as soon as we
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
validate that it is the right person we
 
04:28:10.510 --> 04:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
are able to pay that person so um that's
 
04:28:13.349 --> 04:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
not typically budgeted so that every
 
04:28:14.790 --> 04:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
year when we to a general fund
 
04:28:16.469 --> 04:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
essentially we take some of that money
 
04:28:18.750 --> 04:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
back and so that's recorded in here so
 
04:28:19.950 --> 04:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
it's not in the budget that's why you
 
04:28:22.030 --> 04:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
don't see it in 25 but you see activity
 
04:28:24.469 --> 04:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
in 24 and again you're not going to see
 
04:28:27.510 --> 04:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
anything in 26 and 27 but it is
 
04:28:31.790 --> 04:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
typically about that amount what we see
 
04:28:36.510 --> 04:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
um um being taken from um back from the
 
04:28:38.870 --> 04:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
general fund is this the same
 
04:28:42.870 --> 04:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
as yes yes well
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
it is yes it's just the how it's um
 
04:28:48.910 --> 04:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
title here but it is essentially those
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
funds that Weg to general fund every
 
04:28:53.790 --> 04:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
year is a portion of that that we pay
 
04:28:55.830 --> 04:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
every year and that's that's where you
 
04:29:13.429 --> 04:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:17.349 --> 04:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
there's a big jum between what you sp4
 
04:29:21.670 --> 04:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
what you're Bud next years yes the
 
04:29:25.830 --> 04:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
current expense yes that
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
that so the reason you see a big
 
04:29:31.269 --> 04:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
difference here is uh we typically
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
budget sufficient funds in the current
 
04:29:38.510 --> 04:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
expenses line and that is for um the
 
04:29:41.229 --> 04:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
actual account is is amounts that we pay
 
04:29:44.550 --> 04:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
to um audit firms those other firms do
 
04:29:48.030 --> 04:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
outut ofate audits multi-state Audits
 
04:29:51.870 --> 04:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
and um we don't pay them until they
 
04:29:53.750 --> 04:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
report when they finish their audits and
 
04:29:57.750 --> 04:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
they collect um an x amount of property
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's when we pay them approximately
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
10% but because we don't know how much
 
04:30:04.510 --> 04:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to report and remit to US
 
04:30:08.030 --> 04:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
every year we normally have um that line
 
04:30:11.670 --> 04:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
is budgeted um around the you know about
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
the same same amount every year but but
 
04:30:16.429 --> 04:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
again for example in 24 we only spend
 
04:30:20.269 --> 04:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
500,000 um in 25 I'm not I may have the
 
04:30:21.389 --> 04:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
activity I actually might have the
 
04:30:23.950 --> 04:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
activity but but again we we have that
 
04:30:27.269 --> 04:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
is just so we don't um we don't it's not
 
04:30:30.070 --> 04:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
like we'll spend that if if it's not
 
04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just reserved it's
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
budgeted but if it's not um if it's not
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
spent then it just laps us back into
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
that that farm that fund so this this
 
04:30:44.149 --> 04:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
activity of the abandon property um by
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
law we're able to cover administrative
 
04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
expenses with before we es Che the funds
 
04:30:51.550 --> 04:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
to a general fund we take a small
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
portion of it and we pay ourselves for
 
04:30:56.070 --> 04:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
this program um so if we don't again if
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have to pay those other FS we
 
04:31:00.030 --> 04:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
just pay less but that's the reason you
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
see it like it's it's larger than actual
 
04:31:05.349 --> 04:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
expenses in
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
24 but it's only we only pay them if
 
04:31:10.670 --> 04:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
they bring us
 
04:31:13.309 --> 04:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
property so so you're not
 
04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
expecting I mean shouldn't we budget
 
04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
what we actually expecting to the the
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
only all representative Cal yes thank
 
04:31:22.790 --> 04:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so to that point what has
 
04:31:25.070 --> 04:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
the average been it's was
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
500,000 16 56,000 last year what has the
 
04:31:31.349 --> 04:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
average been over say the last 5 to 10
 
04:31:33.630 --> 04:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
years it really varies is that's the
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
reason we don't we don't really know how
 
04:31:36.910 --> 04:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
many audits are going to be completed in
 
04:31:41.309 --> 04:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
a particular year um so typically is is
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
is it's not quite that amount but um or
 
04:31:46.950 --> 04:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
or better said what what has been your
 
04:31:49.469 --> 04:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
maximum so that yeah I don't really have
 
04:31:51.670 --> 04:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
that number but I can take a look at
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
that but again if we don't spend the
 
04:31:55.309 --> 04:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
money if we don't uh it's not like we're
 
04:31:57.149 --> 04:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
going to spend that money is is we only
 
04:31:59.149 --> 04:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
pay them 10% of all the property that
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
wereit to us which is you know this year
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're um expect to collect about $25
 
04:32:10.229 --> 04:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
million so it's it's really
 
04:32:13.389 --> 04:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
a small portion compared to what we
 
04:32:16.429 --> 04:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
collect and and where does that show up
 
04:32:19.510 --> 04:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
as Revenue so this is the abandon
 
04:32:21.990 --> 04:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
property so it's essentially this is
 
04:32:25.389 --> 04:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
recorded in in an account and is a
 
04:32:27.309 --> 04:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
actually a liability account so because
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is so this is so you only see a
 
04:32:31.870 --> 04:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
portion of that activity in this
 
04:32:34.550 --> 04:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
accounting unit is just what we end up
 
04:32:37.750 --> 04:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
paying for administerial cost but all of
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
the other money is essentially the
 
04:32:42.670 --> 04:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
abandon property account has increased
 
04:32:46.710 --> 04:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
by that amount um we return from that
 
04:32:49.710 --> 04:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
account and what we don't return after 3
 
04:32:51.149 --> 04:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
years we cheated through the general
 
04:32:52.590 --> 04:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
fund so it's not activity that flows
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
through this account is is separate in a
 
04:32:58.349 --> 04:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
liability account the financial
 
04:33:01.149 --> 04:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
statements show in a liability
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
account so where can I see the monies
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
going to the general fund in this um so
 
04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's unrestricted revenue and last
 
04:33:12.070 --> 04:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
year was cheated I think it was 19
 
04:33:12.080 --> 04:33:17.070 align:start position:0%
year was cheated I think it was 19
million

04:33:17.070 --> 04:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
um so they have a staff that does
 
04:33:22.150 --> 04:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
nothing else and then they have that 10
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
page thing that gets published in the
 
04:33:27.029 --> 04:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
newspaper at least once a year sometimes
 
04:33:30.150 --> 04:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
twice and that's page after page of of
 
04:33:33.750 --> 04:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
names and and money so yes so last year
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
we cheated 19 million in this year we
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate um it's going to increase
 
04:33:44.189 --> 04:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:47.070 --> 04:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
all right so so let's get a
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
um a history plus plus an the budgeted
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
amount for 26 and 27 okay so again this
 
04:33:55.949 --> 04:33:55.959 align:start position:0%
is this is this is not General funds
 
04:33:58.189 --> 04:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
this is all pay with with those
 
04:33:59.949 --> 04:33:59.959 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property
 
04:34:02.109 --> 04:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
funds right but you said it becomes
 
04:34:02.119 --> 04:34:03.189 align:start position:0%
funds right but you said it becomes
General

04:34:03.189 --> 04:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
General
 
04:34:05.590 --> 04:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
funds it will eventually reduce a small
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
amount of the general fund but it's it
 
04:34:09.670 --> 04:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
but yes of course I can definitely get
 
04:34:11.390 --> 04:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't become 19 million of
 
04:34:14.070 --> 04:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
General fund it will still be 19 million
 
04:34:14.080 --> 04:34:15.310 align:start position:0%
General fund it will still be 19 million
and

04:34:15.310 --> 04:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
more okay so that's to me that's a big
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
number not a small number but that was
 
04:34:24.629 --> 04:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
still that for you it's a small number
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
she was saying that will still happen
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
very little actually goes back to its
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
original correct get keep it all that's
 
04:34:33.949 --> 04:34:33.959 align:start position:0%
the oh I see correct because because
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
historically we don't return all of the
 
04:34:38.551 --> 04:34:38.561 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property that gets reported to
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
us so what the um of course yeah um we
 
04:34:46.230 --> 04:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
only we only historically I think right
 
04:34:48.910 --> 04:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
now we're at like a
 
04:34:52.029 --> 04:34:52.039 align:start position:0%
20% we of the of the property that we
 
04:34:55.230 --> 04:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
receive we only return about 24% so
 
04:34:57.869 --> 04:34:57.879 align:start position:0%
right now we are expected
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
to yeah because we only get it after the
 
04:35:03.150 --> 04:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
bank or whoever has been trying to give
 
04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
it back correct or you know so it's
 
04:35:09.830 --> 04:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
already you know another level okay
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
that's correct so on 25 we're expect to
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
receive we expect that we're going to
 
04:35:15.949 --> 04:35:15.959 align:start position:0%
cheat about 22 million and 26 23 million
 
04:35:18.750 --> 04:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
and in 27 is 26 million and all that's
 
04:35:23.310 --> 04:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue okay not it's not a
 
04:35:26.189 --> 04:35:26.199 align:start position:0%
bad thing to add to the bottom line well
 
04:35:28.709 --> 04:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it is already was right way
 
04:35:35.349 --> 04:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
means know okay okay all right um let's
 
04:35:38.070 --> 04:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
see I've got lots more questions so I
 
04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
think we're going to end up asking you
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
back um any anyone else want to jump in
 
04:35:48.269 --> 04:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
okay um let's go to Grants which is on
 
04:35:51.390 --> 04:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
page actually let's go to um keep on
 
04:35:55.390 --> 04:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:58.910 --> 04:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
144 so I noticed you you separate out
 
04:36:00.910 --> 04:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
the University's Debt Service from all
 
04:36:03.470 --> 04:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
the other Debt Service uh and school
 
04:36:05.670 --> 04:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
building Aid why is
 
04:36:09.551 --> 04:36:09.561 align:start position:0%
that right so the univers The Debt
 
04:36:11.830 --> 04:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
Service for the University system is
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
paid with General funds and we that used
 
04:36:18.750 --> 04:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
to be all together with the with all
 
04:36:21.429 --> 04:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
General funded debt and I will say I
 
04:36:22.510 --> 04:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
think it
 
04:36:22.520 --> 04:36:25.470 align:start position:0%
think it
was

04:36:25.470 --> 04:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
2019 at some point that that was split
 
04:36:30.230 --> 04:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
and I think it was a request from the
 
04:36:32.070 --> 04:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
governor's office at the time to have a
 
04:36:35.189 --> 04:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
separate place for this for for The Debt
 
04:36:37.230 --> 04:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
Service for un the university system so
 
04:36:39.750 --> 04:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
since then we we keep it separately but
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's all paid with General funds the
 
04:36:46.750 --> 04:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
school building Aid that is that service
 
04:36:51.269 --> 04:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
that is going to end in 2029 and that's
 
04:36:54.189 --> 04:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
pay with meals and rooms
 
04:36:57.551 --> 04:36:57.561 align:start position:0%
tax and that's why it needs to be
 
04:37:01.150 --> 04:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
separate okay now back to the
 
04:37:03.910 --> 04:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
university is any of this depend on
 
04:37:05.949 --> 04:37:05.959 align:start position:0%
expected new borrowing for the
 
04:37:09.789 --> 04:37:09.799 align:start position:0%
University or or not yes it has the so
 
04:37:11.629 --> 04:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
as existing debt and the assumtion that
 
04:37:14.070 --> 04:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to issue about 10 million
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
each year uh for the University system
 
04:37:18.551 --> 04:37:18.561 align:start position:0%
and that's the amount included in the
 
04:37:24.470 --> 04:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:28.470 --> 04:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay so if we stop doing that would it
 
04:37:31.230 --> 04:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
start to affect fiscal year
 
04:37:35.551 --> 04:37:35.561 align:start position:0%
27 correct okay so 26 is kind of fixed
 
04:37:37.830 --> 04:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
because we're doing it now I understand
 
04:37:41.949 --> 04:37:41.959 align:start position:0%
okay good um
 
04:37:52.189 --> 04:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:55.349 --> 04:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
148 um scholarships and grants College
 
04:37:58.590 --> 04:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
savings commission so there's a a large
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
increase from 24 to 25 and that's
 
04:38:05.629 --> 04:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
carried through to 26 and 27 so where is
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
this money coming
 
04:38:12.670 --> 04:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
from it you at page 148 right page 148
 
04:38:15.590 --> 04:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:19.150 --> 04:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
this includes activity
 
04:38:21.789 --> 04:38:21.799 align:start position:0%
of I think you're you're by the way your
 
04:38:24.869 --> 04:38:24.879 align:start position:0%
M I hit the wrong button sorry um this
 
04:38:27.189 --> 04:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
accounting unit it it's it's it's an
 
04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
activity that actually
 
04:38:32.750 --> 04:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
facilitates um the financial activity of
 
04:38:35.070 --> 04:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire excellence and higher
 
04:38:38.230 --> 04:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so as a trust fund
 
04:38:40.109 --> 04:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
uh and because I
 
04:38:43.070 --> 04:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
think my office years ago in order to
 
04:38:46.269 --> 04:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
facilitate payments to to um colleges
 
04:38:48.029 --> 04:38:48.039 align:start position:0%
universities they decided to put it in
 
04:38:50.510 --> 04:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
this in in this accounting unit so we
 
04:38:54.869 --> 04:38:54.879 align:start position:0%
make payments to schools for um for the
 
04:38:58.510 --> 04:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
um the administrative expenses of the um
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
College SS program and also for two
 
04:39:03.429 --> 04:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
scholarship programs flow through this
 
04:39:05.310 --> 04:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
um accounting
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
unit and two already has his eye on this
 
04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
money he's Gonna Take It from here and
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
give it to UNH and and substitute for
 
04:39:16.590 --> 04:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
some of the 100 million we usually give
 
04:39:19.949 --> 04:39:19.959 align:start position:0%
them I see but why is it what's the
 
04:39:23.189 --> 04:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
source of the8 the $5 million increase
 
04:39:25.990 --> 04:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
Fidelity the managing no no no
 
04:39:28.629 --> 04:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
specifically from 20 why is 25 different
 
04:39:28.639 --> 04:39:29.429 align:start position:0%
specifically from 20 why is 25 different
than

04:39:29.429 --> 04:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
24 so um in 24 um even though we collect
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
about $18 million in in from that plan
 
04:39:42.628 --> 04:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
um only 13 million was the dispersed in
 
04:39:45.310 --> 04:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
Scholarships in um in
 
04:39:49.390 --> 04:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
25 and 26 and 27 we anticipate that we
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
will disperse uh those funds to to New
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire schools to New Hampshire
 
04:39:57.390 --> 04:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire schools okay
 
04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
so you're saying in 24 we took 5 million
 
04:40:02.510 --> 04:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
and used it for some other purpose it's
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
it stayed in the trust
 
04:40:08.350 --> 04:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
fund oh it's in the trust fund it has a
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
balance representative evil but what was
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
the source of the funds for this it's
 
04:40:18.030 --> 04:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
not the 529 plans it is
 
04:40:23.430 --> 04:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
so the 529 plan um there is um an
 
04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
administrator assessment is charged to
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
all 529 participants and the money comes
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
to the state and is recorded in the
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund and so not
 
04:40:35.910 --> 04:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
everything um well I here we're assuming
 
04:40:37.310 --> 04:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend all the money but
 
04:40:38.670 --> 04:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
if we don't end up spending all that
 
04:40:40.310 --> 04:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
money then we only going to transfer
 
04:40:42.670 --> 04:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
from the trust fund to this activity to
 
04:40:44.270 --> 04:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit the amount that is
 
04:40:47.470 --> 04:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
needed to pay those grants um but but we
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
do collect about 18 million from from
 
04:40:52.270 --> 04:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
that charge but it's not really like a
 
04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
grant or a scholarship I mean I used it
 
04:40:56.910 --> 04:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
to help put my kids through school it's
 
04:40:59.070 --> 04:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
it was my own money that I was putting
 
04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
in so it's not like when I get it back
 
04:41:04.270 --> 04:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
it's a scholarship right so there're two
 
04:41:05.948 --> 04:41:05.958 align:start position:0%
different things so the the college
 
04:41:08.590 --> 04:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
students program the one you were um a
 
04:41:11.470 --> 04:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
participant of right the f29 plan is
 
04:41:13.830 --> 04:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
separate so for all of the participants
 
04:41:16.670 --> 04:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
that charged a small amount is is it
 
04:41:18.550 --> 04:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
depends on the fund but it's about 10
 
04:41:22.990 --> 04:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
basis points that we um based on the
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
assets and the management that's how
 
04:41:28.150 --> 04:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
much we collect that goes into the trust
 
04:41:32.670 --> 04:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
fund then um the college to service plan
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
advisory commission is responsible for
 
04:41:37.708 --> 04:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
overseeing two scholarship programs that
 
04:41:40.470 --> 04:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
are funded from that fund um those are
 
04:41:42.150 --> 04:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
called the unique scholarship programs
 
04:41:43.868 --> 04:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
there are two types one are direct
 
04:41:46.230 --> 04:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
scholarships to that go to New Hampshire
 
04:41:49.788 --> 04:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
students and the other one is um is a
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
program that funds um institution
 
04:41:54.190 --> 04:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
endowments all of the colleges
 
04:41:55.470 --> 04:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
universities have been been
 
04:41:58.110 --> 04:41:58.120 align:start position:0%
participating in in that program and so
 
04:42:01.868 --> 04:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
a portion uh goes to those endowments um
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
lately the commission has chosen to send
 
04:42:07.070 --> 04:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
less money to the endowments program and
 
04:42:09.590 --> 04:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
to right to the endowments and send more
 
04:42:12.150 --> 04:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
funds directly to New Hampshire students
 
04:42:15.628 --> 04:42:15.638 align:start position:0%
so that's part of the reason why it was
 
04:42:17.550 --> 04:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
in the past we used to disperse more
 
04:42:19.470 --> 04:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
funds and you will see higher amounts
 
04:42:22.070 --> 04:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
here but because we're trying to find in
 
04:42:23.910 --> 04:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
order to maximize the number of Grants
 
04:42:25.830 --> 04:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
given to New Hampshire students it's

during the 2019 legislative session uh
 
04:45:57.708 --> 04:45:57.718 align:start position:0%
chapter 19p and is administratively
 
04:46:00.788 --> 04:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
attached to das the commission's charge
 
04:46:02.510 --> 04:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
is to advise the governor and general
 
04:46:04.910 --> 04:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
court on policy and planning related to

aging the commission assesses existing
 
04:46:09.030 --> 04:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
and potential public policies
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness in providing an an
 
04:46:13.750 --> 04:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for all of us to age and be
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
and be a thriving part of the fabric of
 
04:46:18.550 --> 04:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
our communities in which we live the
 
04:46:20.150 --> 04:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
driving reason that the commission was
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh created was in response to the
 
04:46:23.070 --> 04:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
demographic shift New Hampshire is
 
04:46:25.430 --> 04:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing currently one-third of New
 
04:46:27.190 --> 04:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population is over the age
 
04:46:31.750 --> 04:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
of 55 the 80 plus population is 4.2% of
 
04:46:34.470 --> 04:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
our state's population the New Hampshire
 
04:46:36.510 --> 04:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
Department of uh business and economic
 
04:46:38.670 --> 04:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
Affairs population projection suggests
 
04:46:41.948 --> 04:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
that by the 20 year 2030 older adults
 
04:46:44.590 --> 04:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
will outnumber children in our state um
 
04:46:46.990 --> 04:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
with uh being one-third of our state's
 
04:46:50.230 --> 04:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
population um over the age of 65 and by
 
04:46:53.070 --> 04:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
2050 uh close to 12% of our state's
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
population will be o um 80 years and
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
older and this is a rapid permanent uh
 
04:47:00.270 --> 04:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
transformational demographic shift and
 
04:47:02.830 --> 04:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
this so you're doing too good a job we
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
we we need a commission on
 
04:47:07.948 --> 04:47:07.958 align:start position:0%
youth no so what this commission does is
 
04:47:09.510 --> 04:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
we try to take advantage of the
 
04:47:11.230 --> 04:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity of older adults uh this
 
04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
growing older adult population is not
 
04:47:14.350 --> 04:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
just a challenge to our state and County
 
04:47:16.910 --> 04:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
budgets but it is also an opportunity an
 
04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
economic opportunity for our state and
 
04:47:21.548 --> 04:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
so um that's what the commission is here
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
to help our state realize so um moving
 
04:47:26.750 --> 04:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
on to how the commission is staffed um I
 
04:47:28.548 --> 04:47:28.558 align:start position:0%

04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
inboxes um um so that you can use it
 
04:49:44.030 --> 04:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
yourself and you can share it with your
 
04:49:46.868 --> 04:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
constituents so your office you are not
 
04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
writing this newsletter uh writing
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
pieces of it but one of the the
 
04:49:52.470 --> 04:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer commission members edits this
 
04:49:54.310 --> 04:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
newsletter it's actually a newsletter
 
04:49:55.830 --> 04:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
that has existed in the state for a
 
04:49:57.070 --> 04:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
number of years before the commission
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
came to existence by volunteer group and
 
04:50:01.230 --> 04:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
they asked the commission to take it on
 
04:50:03.070 --> 04:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh to bring forward to talk about
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
programs that are happened in the state
 
04:50:08.590 --> 04:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
um and how to access those programs um
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
but also just in general um there's all
 
04:50:13.350 --> 04:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
sorts of things that impact how we age
 
04:50:16.628 --> 04:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
um um choices Etc and education helps
 
04:50:18.670 --> 04:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
there's getting access to information is
 
04:50:21.868 --> 04:50:21.878 align:start position:0%
very hard
 
04:50:24.910 --> 04:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
um but our office does we do have a
 
04:50:27.230 --> 04:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
constant contact account to deonate the
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
newsletter um our U admin person
 
04:50:34.030 --> 04:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
controls the the the mailing list um uh
 
04:50:35.750 --> 04:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
and mails out the hard copies to the few
 
04:50:39.708 --> 04:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
people who insist on hard copies um um
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
and our communication ation director
 
04:50:42.910 --> 04:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
submits uh contributes at least two
 
04:50:45.190 --> 04:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
articles a month to it
 
04:50:45.200 --> 04:50:47.430 align:start position:0%
articles a month to it
so

04:50:47.430 --> 04:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:50.470 --> 04:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
um we also Implement an annual Awards
 
04:50:52.310 --> 04:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
program honoring older adult volunteers
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
across the state that has been a
 
04:50:56.750 --> 04:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
tradition in our state uh since
 
04:51:01.670 --> 04:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
1962 um and we honor those um we uh
 
04:51:02.948 --> 04:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
together with the governor of the state
 
04:51:04.948 --> 04:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
we honor those folks in May which is
 
04:51:07.628 --> 04:51:07.638 align:start position:0%
older uh American SM um and the
 
04:51:10.230 --> 04:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
executive council chambers um the last
 
04:51:12.070 --> 04:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
bullet on page five notes that the
 
04:51:14.190 --> 04:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
commission is overseeing two arpa funded
 
04:51:16.548 --> 04:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
projects this year and next other
 
04:51:18.590 --> 04:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
agencies running uh projects of similar
 
04:51:21.270 --> 04:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
size typically hire additional staff to
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
oversee those projects the commission
 
04:51:25.948 --> 04:51:25.958 align:start position:0%
hired no additional uh staff to oversee
 
04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
this work um and to carry out this big
 
04:51:29.990 --> 04:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
lift one project is to study
 
04:51:31.670 --> 04:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation issues of non-d drivers
 
04:51:33.708 --> 04:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
in the state you know do we have enough
 
04:51:35.510 --> 04:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation Alternatives do we have
 
04:51:38.590 --> 04:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
the right alternatives are we maximizing
 
04:51:40.590 --> 04:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
existing public resources to best serve
 
04:51:42.628 --> 04:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents there are over
 
04:51:44.230 --> 04:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
5050 potential Federal Government
 
04:51:45.830 --> 04:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
funding streams that come into every
 
04:51:47.948 --> 04:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
state in the Union to support
 
04:51:50.190 --> 04:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation um are we coordinating
 
04:51:51.868 --> 04:51:51.878 align:start position:0%
that funding to support uh
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation Alternatives these are
 
04:51:56.230 --> 04:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
just some of the questions um the study
 
04:51:57.390 --> 04:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
will seek to
 
04:52:01.390 --> 04:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
answer the second project is is uh is to
 
04:52:03.510 --> 04:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
connect um is to connect with granite
 
04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
Staters to learn in a in a very
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way what opportunities and
 
04:52:10.150 --> 04:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
barriers families face as loved ones age
 
04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
here in the Granite State this project
 
04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
will also engage members of the
 
04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
legislature to get your ideas uh on what
 
04:52:19.190 --> 04:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
in state government might need to change
 
04:52:20.990 --> 04:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
to respond to the demographic shift our
 
04:52:23.470 --> 04:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
state is facing um does the right
 
04:52:25.230 --> 04:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure exist in our communities
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
to some support people of all economic
 
04:52:30.190 --> 04:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
stations to age in their communities
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
just as an aside we all know rich or
 
04:52:34.110 --> 04:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
poor um getting services and supports
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
into the home is almost impossible uh
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
the workforce just isn't there so moving
 
04:52:41.110 --> 04:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
on um are those resources organized and
 
04:52:43.350 --> 04:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
financed in the right way is our state
 
04:52:45.190 --> 04:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
poised to take advantage of the economic
 
04:52:46.548 --> 04:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
possibilities of what is called the
 
04:52:49.548 --> 04:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
longevity economy the some economic
 
04:52:51.510 --> 04:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
activity driven by the contributions and
 
04:52:54.110 --> 04:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
needs of people aged 50 and older which
 
04:52:56.708 --> 04:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
is more significant than any other age
 
04:52:58.590 --> 04:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
cohorts these findings will be the
 
04:53:00.750 --> 04:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
foundation um the commission will use to
 
04:53:03.548 --> 04:53:03.558 align:start position:0%
develop a plan we are calling the agw NH
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
plan a 10-year multi sector plan vision
 
04:53:08.910 --> 04:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
for modernizing state government in the
 
04:53:10.590 --> 04:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
face of trans the transformation
 
04:53:12.310 --> 04:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
demographic shift we're
 
04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
facing so moving on to to the discussion
 
04:53:18.070 --> 04:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
of the commission's um on AG budget um
 
04:53:19.670 --> 04:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
by looking at the spreadsheet I actually
 
04:53:21.030 --> 04:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
put a spreadsheet in the budget packet
 
04:53:22.190 --> 04:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
too if that's I don't know if that's
 
04:53:24.350 --> 04:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
easier to look at than the the stack of
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
papers you have in your binders
 
04:53:33.708 --> 04:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
the yeah it is Page um six thank you so
 
04:53:40.628 --> 04:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
by looking at page six in the package
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
you can see that we're a very small
 
04:53:45.910 --> 04:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
agency with very basic operations 85% of
 
04:53:48.230 --> 04:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25's budget is for salary
 
04:53:51.190 --> 04:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
and benefits if it if you look at class
 
04:53:53.548 --> 04:53:53.558 align:start position:0%
60 benefits you'll see the largest
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
increase to this budget compared to
 
04:53:57.910 --> 04:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
previous years health insurance benefits
 
04:53:59.670 --> 04:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately were in inaccurately
 
04:54:02.270 --> 04:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
determined in the last uh bium and were
 
04:54:04.948 --> 04:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
not adequate um those benefits of course
 
04:54:06.510 --> 04:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
are a necessary part of the commission
 
04:54:09.510 --> 04:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
budget um fiscal year 25 as you can see
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
had not quite 30
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
,000 there um and for fiscal year 26 the
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
ask is for just over
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
$70,000 regarding uh Personnel expenses
 
04:54:23.230 --> 04:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
do the do the Temporaries the part-
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
timers get some benefits no they do not
 
04:54:27.788 --> 04:54:27.798 align:start position:0%
see so that's just for the one full-time
 
04:54:30.110 --> 04:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
executive director position it was it
 
04:54:32.628 --> 04:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
was a pretty big slip that it was not
 
04:54:35.510 --> 04:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
accurately um calculated last budget
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
they had to there's a fund that they had
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
to borrow from to pay for benefits this
 
04:54:41.910 --> 04:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
year um
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
regarding Personnel expenses the fiscal
 
04:54:46.070 --> 04:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
year 26 efficiency budget reflects a
 
04:54:48.150 --> 04:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
loss of five hours a week of part-time
 
04:54:50.110 --> 04:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
assistance this really has a very
 
04:54:52.470 --> 04:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
significant loss in a in a small
 
04:54:55.030 --> 04:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
office um reviewing the remaining
 
04:54:56.548 --> 04:54:56.558 align:start position:0%
non-personnel parts of the fiscal year
 
04:54:59.788 --> 04:54:59.798 align:start position:0%
26 budget in comparison to 25 the
 
04:55:01.990 --> 04:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
increases except for class 46 the
 
04:55:04.470 --> 04:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
Consultants line are largely the cost of
 
04:55:06.350 --> 04:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
keeping lights on and and really are not
 
04:55:07.990 --> 04:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
controllable those increases were
 
04:55:09.150 --> 04:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
required by the department of
 
04:55:10.910 --> 04:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
04:55:12.910 --> 04:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
instate and out ofate travel in fact
 
04:55:14.310 --> 04:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
were reduced to accommodate the
 
04:55:17.310 --> 04:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
increases in the required areas the
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
remaining parts of the budget uh display
 
04:55:22.510 --> 04:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
H um how we decrease budget lines um
 
04:55:25.350 --> 04:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
wherever possible to increase the uh the
 
04:55:26.788 --> 04:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
increase to the Consultants line is to
 
04:55:28.430 --> 04:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
make the commission compliant with
 
04:55:30.510 --> 04:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation and the the Americans
 
04:55:32.910 --> 04:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
with Disabilities Act um our meetings
 
04:55:35.470 --> 04:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
are public and communication access is a
 
04:55:37.470 --> 04:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
requirement uh we have members of the
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
public who attend who are deaf for whom
 
04:55:41.830 --> 04:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
ASL English and interpreters are needed
 
04:55:44.390 --> 04:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
and given our audience many of whom use
 
04:55:46.150 --> 04:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
hearing aids I almost would say was
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
almost 100% of our room today we had a
 
04:55:52.670 --> 04:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
commission meeting today um um it cart
 
04:55:54.510 --> 04:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
reporting would be extremely helpful uh
 
04:55:56.310 --> 04:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
we do not have this lovely room setup
 
04:55:58.510 --> 04:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
you have here with wonderful mics um we
 
04:56:00.510 --> 04:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
when we first convened we did meet here
 
04:56:02.350 --> 04:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
in the legislative off office building I
 
04:56:04.270 --> 04:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
would love to get space in here again it
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
would really help but in the meantime
 
04:56:09.310 --> 04:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
cart reporting um would be extremely
 
04:56:11.708 --> 04:56:11.718 align:start position:0%
beneficial um that's whereby spoken word
 
04:56:13.990 --> 04:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
is written and displayed real time on a
 
04:56:17.390 --> 04:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
screen uh 7500 is needed for both these
 
04:56:17.400 --> 04:56:20.150 align:start position:0%
screen uh 7500 is needed for both these
purposes

04:56:20.150 --> 04:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:56:23.430 --> 04:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
um um the fiscal year 26 and 27 budgets
 
04:56:25.830 --> 04:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
are not flat but nearly so even with the
 
04:56:29.110 --> 04:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
required uh salary increases uh to
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
achieve this we did put $6,000 of the
 
04:56:33.590 --> 04:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
communication access Services uh just
 
04:56:35.708 --> 04:56:35.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned were put into a prioritized
 
04:56:38.310 --> 04:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
need request um that was not funded in
 
04:56:42.270 --> 04:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
um another part of the of the
 
04:56:45.990 --> 04:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
commission's prioritized needs budget
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
that was not funded was to add back the
 
04:56:49.830 --> 04:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
5 hours of uh per week for the admin
 
04:56:53.150 --> 04:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
support that is lost in this budget so
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
um in closing out and that's a loss of
 
04:57:00.070 --> 04:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
about um 8,800 in fiscal year 26 and um
 
04:57:02.948 --> 04:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
close to 8,900 in in fiscal year 27 to
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
add back those those five
 
04:57:09.510 --> 04:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
hours um so to close out um there was a
 
04:57:11.070 --> 04:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
request that we talk about uh the
 
04:57:13.708 --> 04:57:13.718 align:start position:0%
governor's trailer bill on operations um
 
04:57:15.310 --> 04:57:15.320 align:start position:0%
the commission has mentioned in section
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
12 of the uh Governor's trailer bill um
 
04:57:20.470 --> 04:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
our request is and that really that
 
04:57:21.750 --> 04:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
request did come from the Commission on
 
04:57:23.750 --> 04:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
Aging and it's simply to lengthen the
 
04:57:25.628 --> 04:57:25.638 align:start position:0%
term of Governor appointed members of
 
04:57:27.430 --> 04:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
the commission from two years to three
 
04:57:30.030 --> 04:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
on a going forward basis commission
 
04:57:31.590 --> 04:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
members agree that the current terms are
 
04:57:33.590 --> 04:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
just too short just as soon as somebody
 
04:57:35.350 --> 04:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
finally gets up to speed on on all the
 
04:57:37.150 --> 04:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
issues that we're studying where they
 
04:57:38.708 --> 04:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
really can begin to have significant
 
04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
impact on and contribute the work um
 
04:57:43.350 --> 04:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
they find their term is up so it's a
 
04:57:44.750 --> 04:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
small change that should make a big
 
04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
difference in the quality of the work
 
04:57:48.350 --> 04:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
that the commission's able to achieve
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm I'm happy to answer
 
04:57:53.868 --> 04:57:53.878 align:start position:0%

um 35 years and um you know since the
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%

04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
pulse on the on the heartbeat of what's
 
04:58:40.350 --> 04:58:40.360 align:start position:0%

you okay why um let me ask about the
budget

04:59:12.110 --> 04:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:59:17.910 --> 04:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
um your uh it cost is going up
 
04:59:19.830 --> 04:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
significantly from what you actually
 
04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
spent in 24 do you know why
 
04:59:28.390 --> 04:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
um so that number did come from U Das
 
04:59:31.350 --> 04:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
doit yeah uh I can't tell you exactly
 
04:59:33.628 --> 04:59:33.638 align:start position:0%
why uh I can tell you we do not need any
 
04:59:33.638 --> 04:59:35.708 align:start position:0%
why uh I can tell you we do not need any
new

04:59:35.708 --> 04:59:35.718 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:59:40.070 --> 04:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
hardware oh did you in 24 only have one
 
04:59:42.670 --> 04:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
part-time person is uh uh correct
 
04:59:45.070 --> 04:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
correct gotta yeah and probably the new
 
04:59:47.910 --> 04:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
part-time person has a computer yes they
 
04:59:50.670 --> 04:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
do we are we are fully computered up
 
04:59:53.350 --> 04:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's why because they charge
 
04:59:57.910 --> 04:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
you per computer that you have uh yeah
 
05:00:01.990 --> 05:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh could be it could be uh uh there's
 
05:00:03.628 --> 05:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that's going on behind
 
05:00:06.590 --> 05:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
that window yeah okay they also um they
 
05:00:09.150 --> 05:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
do so d uh being administratively
 
05:00:10.830 --> 05:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
attached there's a lot that Das does for
 
05:00:12.628 --> 05:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
us we use their HR function we use their
 
05:00:15.150 --> 05:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
business office function and then with
 
05:00:17.430 --> 05:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh and we get support U through their do
 
05:00:20.350 --> 05:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
which also supports our website as well
 
05:00:22.270 --> 05:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and you probably don't pay rent
 
05:00:24.910 --> 05:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
right oh we do pay rent yeah um that's
 
05:00:28.670 --> 05:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
in line is it line28 no rents uh no yeah
 
05:00:31.390 --> 05:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
transfers to property and plant is
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
rent oh plant and property I see okay
 
05:00:41.230 --> 05:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:45.390 --> 05:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
all right um great so uh I guess we'll
 
05:00:46.910 --> 05:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
read all these
 
05:00:52.430 --> 05:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
reports and um we can take a break until
 
05:00:56.430 --> 05:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
3:15 Mr chair yes represent I realize
 
05:00:58.470 --> 05:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
that we don't have the official
 
05:01:01.390 --> 05:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
hb2 but oh yes did you want to talk
 
05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
about there's something in hb2 go ahead
 
05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
you had just mentioned it briefly but if
 
05:01:09.470 --> 05:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
we can resolve that at this point we
 
05:01:12.670 --> 05:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
could cross it off it's just the terms
 
05:01:15.190 --> 05:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
yes just the terms right extending from
 
05:01:17.190 --> 05:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
two to three is that correct So
 
05:01:20.190 --> 05:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
currently um members are eligible for
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
two two up to two twoyear terms um and I
 
05:01:26.548 --> 05:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
think that the governor's office would
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
also appreciate not having as soon as
 
05:01:31.948 --> 05:01:31.958 align:start position:0%

[Music]

05:11:50.910 --> 05:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:50.920 --> 05:11:52.708 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:11:52.708 --> 05:11:52.718 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%

05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:14.350 --> 05:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
let uh well anyways so welcome Mr
 
05:12:17.510 --> 05:12:17.520 align:start position:0%

chairman and good afternoon
 
05:12:27.868 --> 05:12:27.878 align:start position:0%
Representatives um members of this um

committee I am Chuck seya the executive
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
director of the governor's Commission on
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
disability and to my left is our
 
05:12:38.670 --> 05:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
business administrator Miss Stacy dubia
 
05:12:41.708 --> 05:12:41.718 align:start position:0%
who obviously plays an integral part of
 
05:12:43.788 --> 05:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
putting together this uh presentation uh
 
05:12:46.390 --> 05:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
for today again um once again thank you
 
05:12:48.590 --> 05:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity Mr chair I I would
 
05:12:52.628 --> 05:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
defer to you um we do have a PowerPoint
 
05:12:55.708 --> 05:12:55.718 align:start position:0%
presentation um that's in your packet I
 
05:12:58.390 --> 05:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
can review the PowerPoint if you'd like
 
05:13:01.750 --> 05:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's about 17 pages I can move along or
 
05:13:04.470 --> 05:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
I can just give a not to minimize it but
 
05:13:07.270 --> 05:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
a a high level review so I I I defer to
 
05:13:09.708 --> 05:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
you whichever type of a present I'm
 
05:13:13.830 --> 05:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with with this commission so
 
05:13:16.270 --> 05:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
um why don't you go through it as
 
05:13:17.948 --> 05:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible sure I absolutely
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
will okay so we will go U we'll Turn the
 
05:13:23.590 --> 05:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
Page and we'll go to page two um and the
 
05:13:25.948 --> 05:13:25.958 align:start position:0%
state uh the page says that the Ada is
 
05:13:29.230 --> 05:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
key to understand in the gcd so the Ada
 
05:13:31.190 --> 05:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
is the Americans with Disabilities Act
 
05:13:33.510 --> 05:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
the Americans with Disabilities Act was
 
05:13:37.350 --> 05:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
enacted as a federal law in 1990 and it
 
05:13:40.190 --> 05:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
ensures that discrimination based upon a
 
05:13:42.628 --> 05:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
disability is outlawed and is abolished
 
05:13:43.788 --> 05:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
when we think of the governor's
 
05:13:46.868 --> 05:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability um our driving
 
05:13:49.628 --> 05:13:49.638 align:start position:0%
statute is the Ada and as well as that
 
05:13:52.548 --> 05:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
has now um been codified uh in State
 
05:13:56.030 --> 05:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
Statute um so we can go over to the page
 
05:14:00.230 --> 05:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
three um we are administratively within
 
05:14:01.708 --> 05:14:01.718 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's office although we
 
05:14:03.910 --> 05:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
have our own physical location when
 
05:14:05.590 --> 05:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
there is a budget submission we are part
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the uh governor's office um the gcd
 
05:14:11.510 --> 05:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
we refer to it has an executive director
 
05:14:15.310 --> 05:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
as well as a staff um and we we actually
 
05:14:17.670 --> 05:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
we work together for the agency and if
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
we go to page four but the commission is
 
05:14:24.150 --> 05:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
made up currently of 15 uh Governor
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
appointed commission members uh the
 
05:14:28.750 --> 05:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
commission they're all voting members
 
05:14:31.230 --> 05:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
the commission meets five times a year
 
05:14:33.590 --> 05:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
and they they are they represent a
 
05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
cross-section of of disability uh
 
05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
persons with a disability family members
 
05:14:40.190 --> 05:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
or parents or guardians of a person with
 
05:14:42.510 --> 05:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
a disability uh members of the general
 
05:14:45.350 --> 05:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
public and organizations that actually
 
05:14:48.430 --> 05:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
provide um Direct Services so if we go
 
05:14:51.990 --> 05:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
to page five there are also ex official
 
05:14:54.310 --> 05:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
members are non-voting members that have
 
05:14:57.470 --> 05:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
a seat on the commission represented by
 
05:15:01.070 --> 05:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh HHS uh Bureau of voke Rehab from New
 
05:15:03.868 --> 05:15:03.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um Department of Ed supervisor
 
05:15:06.548 --> 05:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
of blind Services Commissioner of Labor
 
05:15:09.548 --> 05:15:09.558 align:start position:0%
or design Employment Security or design
 
05:15:12.390 --> 05:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
and a member of the State Board um of
 
05:15:16.030 --> 05:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
education so if we go to page six within
 
05:15:19.470 --> 05:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
the statutory framework of RSA 275c
 
05:15:21.270 --> 05:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
which is the enabling statute of the
 
05:15:23.548 --> 05:15:23.558 align:start position:0%
governor Commission on disability um
 
05:15:25.990 --> 05:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
there's a statutory committee known
 
05:15:28.270 --> 05:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
known as the committee on architectural
 
05:15:30.830 --> 05:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
barrier-free design um they are
 
05:15:33.590 --> 05:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
currently made up of eight members and
 
05:15:36.510 --> 05:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
they are charged with um promulgating
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
and Publishing what's known as a code
 
05:15:40.910 --> 05:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
for barrier-free design which is
 
05:15:42.590 --> 05:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
essentially what has been adopted is
 
05:15:45.628 --> 05:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
what's known as the 2010 Ada standards
 
05:15:48.750 --> 05:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
for accessibility um in its purest form
 
05:15:51.230 --> 05:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
how many accessible parking spaces are
 
05:15:54.070 --> 05:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
needed um what are the dimensions for a
 
05:15:56.350 --> 05:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
counter if an individual um has a
 
05:15:58.270 --> 05:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
disability and and and he or she is
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
approaching the counter so when we look
 
05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
at the physical is a grab rail needed is
 
05:16:04.350 --> 05:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
a ramp needed is a push plate needed and
 
05:16:07.948 --> 05:16:07.958 align:start position:0%
that's what the abfc um is charged with
 
05:16:09.990 --> 05:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
and importantly with the
 
05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
abfc they actually also render what are
 
05:16:14.990 --> 05:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
called letters of opinion so when the
 
05:16:17.070 --> 05:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is going to enter
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
into a third party lease for uh real
 
05:16:22.230 --> 05:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
estate so for example um we could use
 
05:16:24.390 --> 05:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
DMV as an example when they open up a
 
05:16:27.430 --> 05:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
SAT a satellite location um that will
 
05:16:29.548 --> 05:16:29.558 align:start position:0%
not be owned by the state typically so
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
they come before the uh committee on
 
05:16:33.670 --> 05:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
architecture barrier free design and ask
 
05:16:35.868 --> 05:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
for an opinion as for accessibility they
 
05:16:37.990 --> 05:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
render that opinion that then becomes
 
05:16:39.470 --> 05:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
part of the package that goes to the
 
05:16:41.110 --> 05:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
governor and executive councel for their
 
05:16:43.390 --> 05:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
approval so that's where the ab fits in
 
05:16:47.470 --> 05:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
to the gcd but it's only for state owned
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
or released buildings correct yes not
 
05:16:53.708 --> 05:16:53.718 align:start position:0%
right you know Joe's Sub Shop or
 
05:16:56.910 --> 05:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
something well I well as far as the
 
05:16:58.750 --> 05:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
within the ab committee you're 100%
 
05:17:00.750 --> 05:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
right however we do get those calls at
 
05:17:03.390 --> 05:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
the agency about Joe subshop and whether
 
05:17:06.548 --> 05:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
or not our um on staff accessibility
 
05:17:09.510 --> 05:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
specialist can assist oh I see and and
 
05:17:12.310 --> 05:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes or no um regarding I'm
 
05:17:14.990 --> 05:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
sorry the the whether you assist them we
 
05:17:17.350 --> 05:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
do assist yes yes we do assist as much
 
05:17:21.030 --> 05:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
as we can um now is this uh Ada
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
standards in Incorporated in the State
 
05:17:25.350 --> 05:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
Building Code or not yes yeah that's a
 
05:17:26.708 --> 05:17:26.718 align:start position:0%
great question so the building code
 
05:17:28.670 --> 05:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
review board as you know promulgates the
 
05:17:30.788 --> 05:17:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh State Building Code and built within
 
05:17:33.510 --> 05:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code are Ada uh
 
05:17:36.470 --> 05:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
standards which mimic um the Ada I think
 
05:17:39.708 --> 05:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
it's and again I think it's called an
 
05:17:39.718 --> 05:17:41.670 align:start position:0%
it's and again I think it's called an
117

05:17:41.670 --> 05:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
117
 
05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
ANSI I I don't remember what it stands
 
05:17:47.230 --> 05:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
for but those are the accessibility
 
05:17:49.070 --> 05:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
standards that are built right into the
 
05:17:51.150 --> 05:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
State Building Code so that that's a
 
05:17:53.310 --> 05:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
very good question and do you go before
 
05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
that board and uh when they make changes
 
05:17:58.708 --> 05:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
or something excellent question um per
 
05:18:00.910 --> 05:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
the statute of the building code review
 
05:18:04.270 --> 05:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
board it requires that a representative
 
05:18:05.788 --> 05:18:05.798 align:start position:0%
from the architecture barrier free
 
05:18:09.270 --> 05:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
design committee sit on the bcrb which
 
05:18:10.910 --> 05:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
is what we have we have a representative
 
05:18:12.510 --> 05:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
that sits on that because you bring out
 
05:18:13.830 --> 05:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
a great point there has to be an
 
05:18:15.990 --> 05:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
intersection of state government meaning
 
05:18:17.390 --> 05:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
one hand has to know what the other hand
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
is doing especially when it comes to
 
05:18:21.390 --> 05:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
accessibility that that is a great
 
05:18:25.110 --> 05:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
question um if we turn to page seven uh
 
05:18:27.590 --> 05:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
that is the organization chart of the
 
05:18:31.070 --> 05:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
agency um right now there are eight um
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
positions um two of the eight positions
 
05:18:37.670 --> 05:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
are part time and one of the positions
 
05:18:40.470 --> 05:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
is vacant which we followed up um in an
 
05:18:42.390 --> 05:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
email to you Mr chairman regarding the
 
05:18:45.030 --> 05:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
um vacant position um just reviewing
 
05:18:47.310 --> 05:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
them we have a client assistance um
 
05:18:50.110 --> 05:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
program Advocate who works with uh
 
05:18:52.590 --> 05:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who essentially are working
 
05:18:54.548 --> 05:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
within the voke rehab system with title
 
05:18:56.868 --> 05:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
one under the Ada of employment the
 
05:19:00.750 --> 05:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
accessibility specialist um deals with
 
05:19:02.590 --> 05:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
and works with anything that has to do
 
05:19:04.030 --> 05:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
with architectural or physical
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
accessibility many calls come from code
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
um inspectors architects um we have a
 
05:19:11.350 --> 05:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
new research and Information Specialist
 
05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
who handles the vast majority of calls
 
05:19:16.628 --> 05:19:16.638 align:start position:0%
that come into the gcd generally related
 
05:19:19.110 --> 05:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
to the Ada the number one call that
 
05:19:21.910 --> 05:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
comes into the gcd is service animals
 
05:19:23.390 --> 05:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
and what is a service animal and what is
 
05:19:26.310 --> 05:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
an emotional support animal um to my
 
05:19:27.948 --> 05:19:27.958 align:start position:0%
left is our business administrator and
 
05:19:30.030 --> 05:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
Stacy does an incredible job with the
 
05:19:32.548 --> 05:19:32.558 align:start position:0%
finances um managing the various grants
 
05:19:34.948 --> 05:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
we have Works closely with division of
 
05:19:38.190 --> 05:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
personnel um for employee matters builds
 
05:19:40.030 --> 05:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
the budget and obviously meets with me
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis with our statement of
 
05:19:44.948 --> 05:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and detailed register we
 
05:19:46.548 --> 05:19:46.558 align:start position:0%
have an administrative secretary that
 
05:19:50.990 --> 05:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
provide support um for the entire office
 
05:19:53.310 --> 05:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
um over way over to the right is what is
 
05:19:55.150 --> 05:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
known as a silk the Statewide
 
05:19:58.110 --> 05:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
Independent Living Program and its
 
05:20:00.030 --> 05:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
council is housed at our agency and
 
05:20:02.270 --> 05:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
we'll go through the budget um that has
 
05:20:04.670 --> 05:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
to do with Independent Living Services
 
05:20:06.708 --> 05:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
and the ada8 coordinator is the vacant
 
05:20:08.750 --> 05:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
position um which I'm sure we'll talk
 
05:20:12.350 --> 05:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
about um further on um if we can okay
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
the Ada coordinator is vacant that's the
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
vacant position and which ones are the
 
05:20:18.350 --> 05:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
two-part time yeah so Ada coordinator is
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
part-time as well as the Statewide
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
Independent Living Council program
 
05:20:26.030 --> 05:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
assistant is parttime and that's aund
 
05:20:27.788 --> 05:20:27.798 align:start position:0%
that funding correct me if I'm wrong
 
05:20:30.948 --> 05:20:30.958 align:start position:0%
Stacy comes from our department of Ed
 
05:20:32.990 --> 05:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Ed fully
 
05:20:35.750 --> 05:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
funds the program assistant salary
 
05:20:38.150 --> 05:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
part-time salary parttime benefits um
 
05:20:40.470 --> 05:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
and other the Met is as she supports the
 
05:20:41.670 --> 05:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
council the Statewide Independent Living
 
05:20:48.030 --> 05:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
Council okay I know there's a lot there
 
05:20:52.510 --> 05:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of lot of acronyms too so so what
 
05:20:54.510 --> 05:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
would the Ada coordinator do if you had
 
05:20:56.788 --> 05:20:56.798 align:start position:0%
one yeah that that's a a great question
 
05:21:00.190 --> 05:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
so again in the interest of time um
 
05:21:02.150 --> 05:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
prior Administration Governor sununu had
 
05:21:03.670 --> 05:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
tasked the governor's Commission on
 
05:21:05.750 --> 05:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
disability to put together what was
 
05:21:08.750 --> 05:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
known as a Workforce task task force to
 
05:21:11.708 --> 05:21:11.718 align:start position:0%
examine hiring protocols as it pertained
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire for
 
05:21:16.030 --> 05:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
individuals with a disability um what is
 
05:21:17.948 --> 05:21:17.958 align:start position:0%
onboarding look like if an individual
 
05:21:20.190 --> 05:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
with a disability is is is attempting to
 
05:21:23.548 --> 05:21:23.558 align:start position:0%
become employed um by the state or if we
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
do have an employee with a disability
 
05:21:28.230 --> 05:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
and that person may have a question
 
05:21:30.788 --> 05:21:30.798 align:start position:0%
regarding an accommodation that person
 
05:21:34.230 --> 05:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
may need um the the basically we
 
05:21:35.750 --> 05:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
discussed it at the workforce focus
 
05:21:38.590 --> 05:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
group and one of the findings was that
 
05:21:41.390 --> 05:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
an ADA coordinator how that the
 
05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
governance Commission on disability
 
05:21:44.990 --> 05:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
which would work closely with the
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
division of personnel would act as a
 
05:21:49.868 --> 05:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
resource for other state agencies when
 
05:21:52.310 --> 05:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
they when they're dealing with questions
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
that either may come from a potential
 
05:21:56.750 --> 05:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
candidate or from a candidate uh strike
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
that from an employee that's already
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
employed because at the end of the day
 
05:22:02.270 --> 05:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
the the theme is is for an individual
 
05:22:04.990 --> 05:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
with a disability to have compe
 
05:22:07.548 --> 05:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
competitive integrated employment and we
 
05:22:09.310 --> 05:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
thought that this would be uh as a
 
05:22:12.548 --> 05:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
finding would be a uh basically a Stella
 
05:22:14.830 --> 05:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
point for the State of New Hampshire so
 
05:22:16.868 --> 05:22:16.878 align:start position:0%
that's the Ada coordinator thank you
 
05:22:20.030 --> 05:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
sure um if we go to page eight Mr
 
05:22:22.470 --> 05:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and and representatives again
 
05:22:24.230 --> 05:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
some of the core functions we advise the
 
05:22:26.510 --> 05:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
Governor State a sister agencies New
 
05:22:28.868 --> 05:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature and the public on
 
05:22:31.030 --> 05:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
the needs and the rights of interests uh
 
05:22:33.548 --> 05:22:33.558 align:start position:0%
of citizens with disabilities um we
 
05:22:37.110 --> 05:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
educate and train Rada um so the gcd the
 
05:22:40.270 --> 05:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
agency is not an enforc agency um
 
05:22:43.030 --> 05:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
however we do whatever we can When Calls
 
05:22:44.788 --> 05:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
come into the office or emails come in
 
05:22:47.230 --> 05:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
we we're averaging about close to 500
 
05:22:50.270 --> 05:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
calls um or emails or inquiries that
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
come up come in every year um regarding
 
05:22:55.830 --> 05:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
Ada and it truly does run the gamut a
 
05:22:57.788 --> 05:22:57.798 align:start position:0%
service animal benefits questions
 
05:23:01.230 --> 05:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
housing questions and where we sit as a
 
05:23:04.110 --> 05:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
resource where our intent is just not to
 
05:23:06.910 --> 05:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
give another 800 number or just call
 
05:23:08.670 --> 05:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
this person we look at a little
 
05:23:10.110 --> 05:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
differently let's see what we can do to
 
05:23:12.910 --> 05:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
resolve the matter inhouse um with the
 
05:23:13.948 --> 05:23:13.958 align:start position:0%
understanding that although we don't
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
have that enforcement capability if we
 
05:23:17.590 --> 05:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
can resolve something at the lowest
 
05:23:19.750 --> 05:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
possible level we believe it would would
 
05:23:21.708 --> 05:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
suit the the citizens of New Hampshire
 
05:23:23.948 --> 05:23:23.958 align:start position:0%
Best and thankfully we have a very good
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
track record of of speaking to
 
05:23:28.510 --> 05:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
businesses of speaking to employees of
 
05:23:30.628 --> 05:23:30.638 align:start position:0%
speaking to landlords what can we do to
 
05:23:32.868 --> 05:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
work this out so that it doesn't have to
 
05:23:35.310 --> 05:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
um get elevated so that's that's how we
 
05:23:38.868 --> 05:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
we look at the GC um if we go to page
 
05:23:42.270 --> 05:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
nine there is a program um pursuant to
 
05:23:42.280 --> 05:23:43.590 align:start position:0%
nine there is a program um pursuant to
RSA

05:23:43.590 --> 05:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
05:23:46.708 --> 05:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
195k that is that is known as the NH
 
05:23:49.470 --> 05:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
able plan the NH able plan is New
 
05:23:51.628 --> 05:23:51.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's able Savings
 
05:23:54.190 --> 05:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
Program um our legislation became
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
effective in 2016 and essentially it
 
05:24:00.030 --> 05:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
allows an individual with a disability
 
05:24:03.110 --> 05:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
to save money without jeopardize and
 
05:24:06.030 --> 05:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
needs-based benefits like Medicaid or
 
05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
SSI across the country this is not
 
05:24:10.910 --> 05:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
particular to New Hampshire if an
 
05:24:12.390 --> 05:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
individual with a disability is
 
05:24:15.628 --> 05:24:15.638 align:start position:0%
collecting SSI on Medicaid and if they
 
05:24:17.350 --> 05:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
hit a threshold which is typically
 
05:24:20.548 --> 05:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
$2,000 they could lose their benefits um
 
05:24:22.788 --> 05:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
National legislation came about in 2014
 
05:24:24.910 --> 05:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
States rolled out their own able plans
 
05:24:26.708 --> 05:24:26.718 align:start position:0%
and we have an able plan I'm in New
 
05:24:28.110 --> 05:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is actually
 
05:24:30.310 --> 05:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
co-administered statutorily by that's
 
05:24:32.830 --> 05:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the gcd as
 
05:24:34.548 --> 05:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
well as the state treasurer whom you
 
05:24:36.910 --> 05:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
just saw about an hour ago moniker and I
 
05:24:40.590 --> 05:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
work very closely is um in essence we
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
have um $12.2 million uh in management
 
05:24:47.390 --> 05:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh assets and 1,900 accounts there are
 
05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
no General funds um so essentially when
 
05:24:53.110 --> 05:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
the uh legislation was passed in
 
05:24:55.830 --> 05:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
2016 um it appoint the gcd executive
 
05:24:57.548 --> 05:24:57.558 align:start position:0%
director as well as state treasur to in
 
05:25:00.270 --> 05:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
their staff to run the program um and
 
05:25:01.948 --> 05:25:01.958 align:start position:0%
and I have to tell you it's a high point
 
05:25:03.548 --> 05:25:03.558 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire that
 
05:25:07.150 --> 05:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
these exist Mr chair representative I
 
05:25:09.070 --> 05:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
well just f following on to what you
 
05:25:12.830 --> 05:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
said I I have a disabled constituent um
 
05:25:14.590 --> 05:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
who just couldn't wait for this program
 
05:25:16.830 --> 05:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
to start and now is a participant and
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
just can't say enough and the family
 
05:25:23.590 --> 05:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
loves it and so kudos to you for a great
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
operation thank you representative it
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
truly is with with the state treasur
 
05:25:29.708 --> 05:25:29.718 align:start position:0%
myself it it is an it's an important
 
05:25:31.510 --> 05:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
part of the equation the prior program
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
was known as stable and and and the
 
05:25:37.110 --> 05:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
prior um uh State Treasurer myself and
 
05:25:38.830 --> 05:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
and I say this we we just hit the road
 
05:25:40.390 --> 05:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
and we just went across the state
 
05:25:41.868 --> 05:25:41.878 align:start position:0%
explaining to people the benefits of
 
05:25:44.190 --> 05:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
this program uh it it truly is a game
 
05:25:46.910 --> 05:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
changer you can save up to 18,000 a year
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
without risking any um loss and and if
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
you're working um that's increased to
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
just over $32,000 a year it's a
 
05:25:56.670 --> 05:25:56.680 align:start position:0%
definitely a a a wonderful program Game
 
05:25:59.310 --> 05:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
Changer well it's a great help to live
 
05:26:01.910 --> 05:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
independently and yes yeah which is
 
05:26:04.708 --> 05:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
really important yeah in if I may what
 
05:26:07.270 --> 05:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
what the stories we hear is that if a
 
05:26:09.548 --> 05:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
grandma or if a family member wanted to
 
05:26:11.670 --> 05:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
give a birthday gift to their grandchild
 
05:26:14.070 --> 05:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
who had a disability well and again this
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
is not unique to New Hampshire they
 
05:26:16.510 --> 05:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
didn't want to give the gift because
 
05:26:17.628 --> 05:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
they were so
 
05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about yeah maxing out yeah and
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
so long as the money is spent on what we
 
05:26:25.070 --> 05:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
call a qualified disability expense it
 
05:26:27.390 --> 05:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
mimics College savings so this is the
 
05:26:31.868 --> 05:26:31.878 align:start position:0%
529a plan College savings is 529 so it's
 
05:26:34.590 --> 05:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
it's my so is this interest bearing uh
 
05:26:36.910 --> 05:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
it is yeah so there's different um there
 
05:26:39.270 --> 05:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
were different portfolios cuz we OB we
 
05:26:42.230 --> 05:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
have a what's known as a Record Keeper
 
05:26:44.708 --> 05:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
um who manages the accounts um and
 
05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
basically you can have a very aggressive
 
05:26:50.430 --> 05:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
um long-term goal oriented type of
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
Interest or you can choose a checking
 
05:26:54.750 --> 05:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
account with a debit account that mimics
 
05:26:56.350 --> 05:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
um you know the ordinary checking
 
05:26:58.628 --> 05:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
account that probably gets it's FDIC
 
05:27:00.868 --> 05:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
insured but hardly gets any interest on
 
05:27:03.788 --> 05:27:03.798 align:start position:0%
the money so the so the the investor has
 
05:27:05.310 --> 05:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity the individual with a
 
05:27:07.868 --> 05:27:07.878 align:start position:0%
disability is the owner of the account
 
05:27:09.390 --> 05:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
do you know what the expenses of the
 
05:27:13.548 --> 05:27:13.558 align:start position:0%
program is yeah um you know I I if you
 
05:27:15.868 --> 05:27:15.878 align:start position:0%
don't mind I could get back to you sir
 
05:27:19.230 --> 05:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
on that I can give you a um it's it's
 
05:27:21.150 --> 05:27:21.160 align:start position:0%
very competitive I I want to say about
 
05:27:23.310 --> 05:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
35 a year but but again please don't
 
05:27:25.070 --> 05:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
quote me on that but I'll definitely get
 
05:27:28.070 --> 05:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
that info thank you so maybe a quarter
 
05:27:30.350 --> 05:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
of a percent like and then I think there
 
05:27:31.708 --> 05:27:31.718 align:start position:0%
were different fees and this is where I
 
05:27:33.628 --> 05:27:33.638 align:start position:0%
would lean on my colleague uh treasure
 
05:27:36.110 --> 05:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
mipel there are different fees um within
 
05:27:38.750 --> 05:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
the investment itself um that they may
 
05:27:40.548 --> 05:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
choose but I can get that information to
 
05:27:43.670 --> 05:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you sure on page 10 again from
 
05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
a very high level the client assistance
 
05:27:48.670 --> 05:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
program facilitates discussions between
 
05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
persons with disabilities and Vocational
 
05:27:53.948 --> 05:27:53.958 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation um that is in a different
 
05:27:56.830 --> 05:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
accounting unit but the cap on budsman
 
05:28:00.670 --> 05:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
um is 100% federally funded um again a
 
05:28:03.390 --> 05:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
very important piece of the equation
 
05:28:06.110 --> 05:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
because every state uh in America has a
 
05:28:09.548 --> 05:28:09.558 align:start position:0%
client assistance program and the gcd is
 
05:28:11.628 --> 05:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
the designated recipient of the federal
 
05:28:14.548 --> 05:28:14.558 align:start position:0%
funds and also we house the UN budsman
 
05:28:15.430 --> 05:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:28:18.470 --> 05:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
program so back in your your picture of
 
05:28:20.948 --> 05:28:20.958 align:start position:0%
the agency yeah was one of these I think
 
05:28:22.670 --> 05:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
it was the first one sir the the very
 
05:28:27.430 --> 05:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
first one the um client assistance let's
 
05:28:30.708 --> 05:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
see yeah oh the udman the udman which
 
05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
would be the first yeah okay yep so this
 
05:28:35.200 --> 05:28:36.830 align:start position:0%
would be the first yeah okay yep so this
is

05:28:36.830 --> 05:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:28:38.868 --> 05:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay um and if we go to page 11 I had
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
referenced this is the parttime position
 
05:28:48.350 --> 05:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
the Statewide Independent Living Council
 
05:28:50.430 --> 05:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
um and the council itself provides
 
05:28:53.150 --> 05:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
advocacy for Independent Living the
 
05:28:55.070 --> 05:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on disability is
 
05:28:57.430 --> 05:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
under a contract with New Hampshire uh
 
05:28:59.510 --> 05:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
education department and we can receive
 
05:29:02.510 --> 05:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
up to 990,000 essentially draw down for
 
05:29:05.350 --> 05:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
salary benefits um supervisory fees
 
05:29:07.670 --> 05:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
assessed to me um Grant um Grant
 
05:29:09.590 --> 05:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
operation and management fees as apply
 
05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
to the business administrator and any
 
05:29:14.390 --> 05:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
other items that the uh program
 
05:29:16.430 --> 05:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
assistant may need um we're actually
 
05:29:19.430 --> 05:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
will be entering to a um new contract
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the Department of Ed
 
05:29:23.070 --> 05:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
because the current contract expires
 
05:29:25.310 --> 05:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
June 30th if I'm not mistaken yes this
 
05:29:27.270 --> 05:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
year of this year yes it's typically a
 
05:29:27.280 --> 05:29:28.910 align:start position:0%
year of this year yes it's typically a
two-year

05:29:28.910 --> 05:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
two-year
 
05:29:33.990 --> 05:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
contract and on page 12 a couple why why
 
05:29:36.390 --> 05:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
is the Department of Ed involved I don't
 
05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
understand yeah another great question
 
05:29:43.110 --> 05:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
so over the years what has been
 
05:29:46.110 --> 05:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
interpreted and this has been before my
 
05:29:48.030 --> 05:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
coming on board um the governor's
 
05:29:49.070 --> 05:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
Commission on
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
disability um per the interpretation of
 
05:29:55.750 --> 05:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
this the federal statute the Statewide
 
05:29:58.190 --> 05:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
Independent Living council's Program
 
05:30:02.070 --> 05:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
assistant cannot be housed um in the
 
05:30:06.110 --> 05:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
same um agency that is considered the
 
05:30:08.708 --> 05:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
designated State entity which is the
 
05:30:11.708 --> 05:30:11.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed so over the year Well
 
05:30:14.150 --> 05:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
prior to my coming on board the gcd
 
05:30:16.628 --> 05:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
entered into a contract with the
 
05:30:19.628 --> 05:30:19.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed to house the Statewide
 
05:30:24.628 --> 05:30:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:24.638 --> 05:30:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
assistant

05:30:27.750 --> 05:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:30.670 --> 05:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
okay and if we and if I'm going too fast
 
05:30:33.750 --> 05:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
I apologize on page 12 couple other
 
05:30:36.670 --> 05:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
programs um that we administer there is
 
05:30:38.990 --> 05:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
a program known as the T Communications
 
05:30:42.190 --> 05:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
equipment assistance program um this is
 
05:30:44.990 --> 05:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
non-general funds and the funds come
 
05:30:48.430 --> 05:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
from the puc's relay service trust
 
05:30:52.670 --> 05:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
fund um and statutorily
 
05:30:56.230 --> 05:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
96,000 a year um is appropriated to the
 
05:30:58.310 --> 05:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
governance Commission on disability and
 
05:31:01.070 --> 05:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
every two years um we put an RFP
 
05:31:04.990 --> 05:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
together and we um we solicit bids from
 
05:31:08.190 --> 05:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
um a third- party contractor to act to
 
05:31:10.510 --> 05:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
operate the te as we refer to it as and
 
05:31:13.868 --> 05:31:13.878 align:start position:0%
what the te does it provides um various
 
05:31:16.310 --> 05:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
types of communication and equipment to
 
05:31:18.788 --> 05:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
individuals with a disability so if
 
05:31:20.750 --> 05:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
you're an individual who is De for hot a
 
05:31:23.230 --> 05:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
hearing there is equipment there um for
 
05:31:26.350 --> 05:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
close caption phones um if you are an
 
05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
individual who is deaf and um you need
 
05:31:31.510 --> 05:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
um an alert when someone is ringing a
 
05:31:33.430 --> 05:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
doorbell it alerts them so those are
 
05:31:36.150 --> 05:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
some of that's some of the equipment um
 
05:31:38.110 --> 05:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
that that is within the te program the
 
05:31:40.190 --> 05:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
program is currently operated by Future
 
05:31:42.590 --> 05:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
Insight which is a provider of Direct
 
05:31:45.230 --> 05:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
Services um in the uh State of New
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so are these just given or are
 
05:31:51.548 --> 05:31:51.558 align:start position:0%
they at a lower cost both applies it
 
05:31:54.150 --> 05:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
dependent upon great question um it
 
05:31:56.230 --> 05:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
basically the individual will have to
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
fill out an application which is driven
 
05:32:01.948 --> 05:32:01.958 align:start position:0%
by our rules and then it will either the
 
05:32:04.270 --> 05:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
the the equipment although always stays
 
05:32:05.430 --> 05:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
the property of the governor's
 
05:32:07.548 --> 05:32:07.558 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability it's either a
 
05:32:10.670 --> 05:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
50 50 split or the um the equipment goes
 
05:32:13.910 --> 05:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
over if they're eligible thank you go
 
05:32:16.270 --> 05:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
ahead represent do you have more people
 
05:32:18.390 --> 05:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
applying than you have
 
05:32:20.670 --> 05:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
funding would you
 
05:32:23.628 --> 05:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
know I don't think so no so you think
 
05:32:27.310 --> 05:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
it's adequately I I do yeah so so I I
 
05:32:29.708 --> 05:32:29.718 align:start position:0%
think and again I'd have to lean on
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
Stacy the current contract that was
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
awarded was probably 91 I think close to
 
05:32:38.510 --> 05:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
91,000 91,000 and I think the V and Drew
 
05:32:40.590 --> 05:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
down what would you say about 70,000
 
05:32:43.990 --> 05:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
about 70,000 I so and future Insight is
 
05:32:46.390 --> 05:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
for the blind it is that is correct you
 
05:32:48.150 --> 05:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
know someone else who's worked with them
 
05:32:50.788 --> 05:32:50.798 align:start position:0%
and they've just been fabulous yeah
 
05:32:53.470 --> 05:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
future Insight again representative if I
 
05:32:56.110 --> 05:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
may miss the chair um again because they
 
05:32:57.670 --> 05:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
provide the Direct Services and because
 
05:33:00.470 --> 05:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're so ingrained in the community um
 
05:33:02.190 --> 05:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
they also have the ability they they'll
 
05:33:04.230 --> 05:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
do whatever it takes to reach out to the
 
05:33:06.470 --> 05:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
rest of the other organizations that
 
05:33:08.390 --> 05:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
represent uh individuals various types
 
05:33:10.510 --> 05:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
of disabilities we've they've been the
 
05:33:13.270 --> 05:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
vendor is it six years Stacy do you
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
remember off hand I think six years six
 
05:33:17.830 --> 05:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
years they they do a really good job
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay how many applications do you
 
05:33:22.750 --> 05:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
get per year you know we don't see the
 
05:33:25.110 --> 05:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
applications I'd have to um future
 
05:33:26.390 --> 05:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
Insight get them and we do have an
 
05:33:29.868 --> 05:33:29.878 align:start position:0%
annual report um that Stacy linked I
 
05:33:32.750 --> 05:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't have access but on your page 12 um
 
05:33:34.548 --> 05:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
is an annual report I I didn't bring the
 
05:33:35.990 --> 05:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
annual report with me I'm more than
 
05:33:38.190 --> 05:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
happy to forward that to you as well sir
 
05:33:42.830 --> 05:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:42.840 --> 05:33:50.230 align:start position:0%
 
yep

05:33:50.230 --> 05:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:53.788 --> 05:33:53.798 align:start position:0%
okay um another program oh excuse me on
 
05:33:56.708 --> 05:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
page 13 is what is known as the national
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
Federation of the blind news lines for
 
05:34:03.110 --> 05:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
the blind which essentially is a service
 
05:34:05.030 --> 05:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
that if you for whatever reason you
 
05:34:07.868 --> 05:34:07.878 align:start position:0%
cannot access the print media very
 
05:34:09.948 --> 05:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
similar to like the talking books um
 
05:34:11.990 --> 05:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is a new service um that will
 
05:34:14.430 --> 05:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
actually um dictate over F various
 
05:34:16.628 --> 05:34:16.638 align:start position:0%
Publications to an individual um with
 
05:34:18.868 --> 05:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
the disability in New Ham there's an
 
05:34:20.390 --> 05:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation of
 
05:34:23.310 --> 05:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
31,500 for purposes of the gcd Mr
 
05:34:24.948 --> 05:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
chairman and representatives we don't
 
05:34:26.830 --> 05:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
get any money we're a pass through on
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
that um however we do work very closely
 
05:34:32.190 --> 05:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
with nfb newsline to ensure that there
 
05:34:35.510 --> 05:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
were two um Publications um in New
 
05:34:36.868 --> 05:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire SE coast online in the
 
05:34:38.910 --> 05:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
conquered monitor that individuals can
 
05:34:40.750 --> 05:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
access and there's also what is referred
 
05:34:44.390 --> 05:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
to as a homepage that individuals um who
 
05:34:46.830 --> 05:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
would like to post information on New
 
05:34:50.150 --> 05:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's um home page we can actually
 
05:34:52.150 --> 05:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
access that as well and again that's
 
05:34:52.160 --> 05:34:53.628 align:start position:0%
access that as well and again that's
statutorily

05:34:53.628 --> 05:34:53.638 align:start position:0%
statutorily
 
05:34:57.430 --> 05:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
driven so so is the nfb newsline
 
05:34:59.548 --> 05:34:59.558 align:start position:0%
something that someone can access online
 
05:35:01.390 --> 05:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
and then just see what or how does that
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
work yeah they can access it online and
 
05:35:04.990 --> 05:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
they can also access it I believe um on
 
05:35:07.110 --> 05:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
their um cell phones and it'll dictate
 
05:35:09.230 --> 05:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
it to them if they want to read New
 
05:35:11.190 --> 05:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or if they wanted to read um
 
05:35:15.510 --> 05:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
Beyond oh cool yeah it's pretty good um
 
05:35:19.030 --> 05:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
and on page 14 um uh we do have a grant
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
that comes in from what's known as the
 
05:35:24.430 --> 05:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
New England Ada Center um right now we
 
05:35:29.230 --> 05:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
um we're receiving in FY 26 4025 and in
 
05:35:33.030 --> 05:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
in fy2 we're awarded
 
05:35:35.270 --> 05:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
6,75 um and the reason being is because
 
05:35:36.628 --> 05:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
they're on a different type of a grant
 
05:35:40.230 --> 05:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
cycle they're in a five via Grant um we
 
05:35:42.910 --> 05:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate that um should we go under
 
05:35:45.310 --> 05:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
contract with them it'll be very close
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
to the 16,000 and we serve as technical
 
05:35:50.110 --> 05:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
assistant with the other New England um
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
ad with the other um Ada centers um in
 
05:35:53.200 --> 05:35:54.070 align:start position:0%
ad with the other um Ada centers um in
New

05:35:54.070 --> 05:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:35:58.548 --> 05:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
England and on page 15 what we have done
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
at the gcd and what we has been very
 
05:36:02.708 --> 05:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
very aggressive you know when you look
 
05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
at this the mission of the gcd it's
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
really to to act as a as a as a as a
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
source of resource for individuals with
 
05:36:11.830 --> 05:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
a disability um as a as a panity
 
05:36:13.830 --> 05:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
Americans with Disabilities Act we have
 
05:36:16.590 --> 05:36:16.600 align:start position:0%

05:36:21.430 --> 05:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
you know we're a small office uh a lot
 
05:36:23.868 --> 05:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
of cross-pollination as I say I I have a
 
05:36:26.670 --> 05:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
great team I shout out to the team um
 
05:36:28.070 --> 05:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
because as you've heard before Mr
 
05:36:31.190 --> 05:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
chairman Representatives I'm only

05:36:34.750 --> 05:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
sincerely mean that and and I'm here
 
05:36:37.990 --> 05:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
because of them what they work together
 
05:36:39.868 --> 05:36:39.878 align:start position:0%
um our social media is robust it's
 
05:36:41.750 --> 05:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
collaborative we just don't post for the
 
05:36:44.270 --> 05:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
sake of posting We Meet on a regular on
 
05:36:46.270 --> 05:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
a weekly basis to figure out what are we
 
05:36:47.868 --> 05:36:47.878 align:start position:0%
going to post and what is the
 
05:36:50.430 --> 05:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
information um that we can get out on
 
05:36:52.548 --> 05:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
our website which has been newly
 
05:36:55.830 --> 05:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
redesigned by doit we have what's called
 
05:36:58.110 --> 05:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
an ADA assistance form where a person
 
05:37:00.590 --> 05:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
can go online fill out a form write
 
05:37:02.430 --> 05:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
online and submit it or they can
 
05:37:04.628 --> 05:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
download a PDF and we also have an
 
05:37:07.230 --> 05:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
architectural access inquiry form which
 
05:37:09.030 --> 05:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
is critical for for those types of
 
05:37:11.390 --> 05:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
questions Revol revolving physical
 
05:37:13.708 --> 05:37:13.718 align:start position:0%
accessibility so Ada is general
 
05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
information and aif um is uh
 
05:37:19.670 --> 05:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
architectural but again it's to really
 
05:37:21.230 --> 05:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
make ourselves accessible you know we're
 
05:37:23.510 --> 05:37:23.520 align:start position:0%

answer our phones we get back to
 
05:37:27.150 --> 05:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
individuals because many times when the
 
05:37:29.110 --> 05:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
calls are coming in it's it's it people
 
05:37:30.510 --> 05:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
are at a stage where they need
 
05:37:33.030 --> 05:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
information I won't go over 16 but it
 
05:37:34.390 --> 05:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
just gives you a highlight of the
 
05:37:37.310 --> 05:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
various organization statutorily within

gives you an idea of the calls that are
 
05:38:19.190 --> 05:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
the top calls disability employment
 
05:38:20.948 --> 05:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
service animals
 
05:38:23.030 --> 05:38:23.040 align:start position:0%

streamline budget um there there is it's
 
05:38:46.190 --> 05:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
it's lean um it's we would say that I
 
05:38:47.430 --> 05:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
would look at this budget I've looked at
 
05:38:51.070 --> 05:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
it many times uh to ensure that we're
 
05:38:55.270 --> 05:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
ready for today um I I truly
 
05:38:57.830 --> 05:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
understand what we're being asked to do
 
05:38:59.390 --> 05:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
as with all agencies and that's our
 
05:39:01.628 --> 05:39:01.638 align:start position:0%
fiduciary obligation I don't run from
 
05:39:03.070 --> 05:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
that and you know if you're not going to
 
05:39:04.548 --> 05:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
sit in the chair to make the decisions
 
05:39:06.110 --> 05:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
don't take the chair and I sincerely
 
05:39:08.948 --> 05:39:08.958 align:start position:0%
mean that but but I can I can tell you
 
05:39:11.390 --> 05:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
we we built a budget as streamline as we
 
05:39:15.670 --> 05:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
could um and uh I'm I will end there
 
05:39:16.868 --> 05:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
because I'm assuming you'll have
 
05:39:18.990 --> 05:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
questions specifically on the budget I
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
took up a lot of your time um but I hope
 
05:39:23.910 --> 05:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
you found it uh informative and helpful
 
05:39:26.070 --> 05:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much let me let me
 
05:39:31.390 --> 05:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
ask on um other funds here
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
um65 two 218 is that the stuff from pu
 
05:39:37.590 --> 05:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
and doe
 
05:39:41.788 --> 05:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
yes yes well no go right ahead Stacy
 
05:39:45.750 --> 05:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
please yeah the other funds are what
 
05:39:52.510 --> 05:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:56.350 --> 05:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
okay and the reason 24 to 25 is
 
05:39:59.070 --> 05:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
different is one is budgeted and one is
 
05:40:01.708 --> 05:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
you still have some vacancy right
 
05:40:04.750 --> 05:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
05:40:08.628 --> 05:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
guessing yeah that's PU and wouldn't
 
05:40:10.350 --> 05:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
that be Ed to
 
05:40:13.270 --> 05:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
education yeah right educa it was silk
 
05:40:17.430 --> 05:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
funds it would come from environment um
 
05:40:19.150 --> 05:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
education I'm taking Environmental
 
05:40:21.548 --> 05:40:21.558 align:start position:0%
Services New Hampshire education
 
05:40:21.558 --> 05:40:23.270 align:start position:0%
Services New Hampshire education
department

05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:40:23.280 --> 05:40:26.468 align:start position:0%
department
and

05:40:26.468 --> 05:40:26.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.628 --> 05:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
pu and the niata funds New England Ada
 
05:40:33.430 --> 05:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
this the the 16,000 that I referenced um
 
05:40:36.390 --> 05:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
so those are the other funds gotcha um
 
05:40:39.030 --> 05:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
just if if you'd like Mr chairman and
 
05:40:42.030 --> 05:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
representatives what Stacy did on page
 
05:40:46.750 --> 05:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
20 of our PowerPoint um she broke down I
 
05:40:49.590 --> 05:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if um I find it very helpful
 
05:40:52.150 --> 05:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
she broke down all the general funds um
 
05:40:54.270 --> 05:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
for your review
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
too and and where it's coming from
 
05:40:59.030 --> 05:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
because when we look at
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
one4 which is the accounting unit there
 
05:41:03.628 --> 05:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
are the mixed funds that are in there
 
05:41:05.830 --> 05:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
that are coming from education that are
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
coming from um Department of Ed oh and
 
05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
Page 21 has all those funds too there
 
05:41:14.750 --> 05:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
they come from the state um cap is the
 
05:41:14.760 --> 05:41:16.190 align:start position:0%
they come from the state um cap is the
federal

05:41:16.190 --> 05:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:41:19.230 --> 05:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
funds um transfer from other agencies
 
05:41:23.150 --> 05:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
that's from New Hampshire education
 
05:41:26.990 --> 05:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
department um and then we have the niata
 
05:41:31.030 --> 05:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
funds which is any uh New England Ada
 
05:41:34.350 --> 05:41:34.360 align:start position:0%
and then um this is at the bottom bottom
 
05:41:38.310 --> 05:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
B page 21 yeah and those are going away
 
05:41:40.868 --> 05:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
no oh no no we were just we thought it
 
05:41:43.548 --> 05:41:43.558 align:start position:0%
may be helpful if you saw General funds
 
05:41:44.990 --> 05:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
versus other funds and where they're
 
05:41:48.548 --> 05:41:48.558 align:start position:0%
coming from no no but I I'm looking at
 
05:41:52.230 --> 05:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
page 21 okay there's only the 16,000 is
 
05:41:55.708 --> 05:41:55.718 align:start position:0%
only in 2024 it's not continued go right
 
05:41:59.548 --> 05:41:59.558 align:start position:0%
ahead um we we don't know because
 
05:42:00.750 --> 05:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
they're in
 
05:42:04.548 --> 05:42:04.558 align:start position:0%
a a fiveyear grant and we don't know how
 
05:42:07.670 --> 05:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
much we get until um
 
05:42:10.708 --> 05:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
that that Federal fisal year right and
 
05:42:13.468 --> 05:42:13.478 align:start position:0%
so we didn't want to put any monies in
 
05:42:15.270 --> 05:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
05:42:18.830 --> 05:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
been it's it's been as high as 18 or
 
05:42:22.788 --> 05:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
20,000 I understand to
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
16,000 yes representative
 
05:42:29.430 --> 05:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you Mr chair uh there's
 
05:42:31.910 --> 05:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
another group that that we have in our
 
05:42:34.868 --> 05:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
budget in the state called the uh
 
05:42:37.708 --> 05:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
development disabilities Council
 
05:42:39.510 --> 05:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
how do their functions and your
 
05:42:41.430 --> 05:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
functions compare and what are the
 
05:42:43.830 --> 05:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
differences yeah thank you for the
 
05:42:46.350 --> 05:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
question it's it's a great question um
 
05:42:48.110 --> 05:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
what we refer to as the DDC
 
05:42:49.788 --> 05:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities councils from
 
05:42:51.350 --> 05:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
what I understand their funding just
 
05:42:56.868 --> 05:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
from a is 100% Federal um funding um
 
05:43:00.548 --> 05:43:00.558 align:start position:0%
and their mission is to assist
 
05:43:03.708 --> 05:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
individuals with Developmental and
 
05:43:06.270 --> 05:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
intellectual um disabilities when we
 
05:43:07.830 --> 05:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
look at the governance Commission on
 
05:43:10.750 --> 05:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
disability we're cross disability so
 
05:43:13.070 --> 05:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
although we will work with individuals
 
05:43:14.670 --> 05:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
who may have a developmental disability
 
05:43:16.750 --> 05:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
or an in intellectual disability we
 
05:43:20.270 --> 05:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
could also work with someone um who is
 
05:43:22.868 --> 05:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
blind or vision impaired or who is deaf
 
05:43:27.628 --> 05:43:27.638 align:start position:0%
or um an individual who may have um uh
 
05:43:30.310 --> 05:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
cerebal paly or muscular distrophy so
 
05:43:32.270 --> 05:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
we're cross disability mental health
 
05:43:34.230 --> 05:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
issu or mental health issues with at the
 
05:43:38.190 --> 05:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
gcd um and with the DDC
 
05:43:41.190 --> 05:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding that federal
 
05:43:45.110 --> 05:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
law mandates that every state have a DDC
 
05:43:47.110 --> 05:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
a developmental disabilities Council as
 
05:43:49.708 --> 05:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
well so I I don't know if I've addressed
 
05:43:51.468 --> 05:43:51.478 align:start position:0%
it or if you have any further questions
 
05:43:51.478 --> 05:43:54.590 align:start position:0%
it or if you have any further questions
sir

05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:56.548 --> 05:43:56.558 align:start position:0%
okay other
 
05:43:59.190 --> 05:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
questions no Mr chair yes I just want to
 
05:44:00.468 --> 05:44:00.478 align:start position:0%
correct the statement I said earlier
 
05:44:02.990 --> 05:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
those do uh the development disability
 
05:44:04.548 --> 05:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
Council does fall under division one and
 
05:44:06.830 --> 05:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
they'll be here Thursday okay and they
 
05:44:11.110 --> 05:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
are 100% Federal fund okay good so
 
05:44:14.868 --> 05:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
you're correct all right anybody else no
 
05:44:17.350 --> 05:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
yes is is the difference in general
 
05:44:19.670 --> 05:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
funds largely
 
05:44:24.270 --> 05:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
benefits benefits and um there's a temp
 
05:44:26.350 --> 05:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
that you're and for the one that's
 
05:44:29.750 --> 05:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
missing the Ada coordinate yeah salaries
 
05:44:32.110 --> 05:44:32.120 align:start position:0%
too um because we do have some people
 
05:44:34.628 --> 05:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
who are going to be yeah step increases
 
05:44:37.708 --> 05:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
or whatever but basically personel
 
05:44:37.718 --> 05:44:39.270 align:start position:0%
or whatever but basically personel
yeah

05:44:39.270 --> 05:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:44:42.990 --> 05:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
yes and I if I may Mr chair what we also
 
05:44:44.708 --> 05:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
um and I'd like to point out if we look
 
05:44:46.190 --> 05:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
at class
 
05:44:51.390 --> 05:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
49 um so that's we this is Page 20 by
 
05:44:52.670 --> 05:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
the way if you want to look at our page
 
05:44:54.310 --> 05:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
20 yes I'm
 
05:44:59.830 --> 05:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
sorry um you see a figure of uh 30,
 
05:45:02.548 --> 05:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
338 um for transfers to other state
 
05:45:05.390 --> 05:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
agencies so that includes the rent so
 
05:45:07.350 --> 05:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're sub tenants of the division
 
05:45:10.150 --> 05:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
of personnel dop is located at 54
 
05:45:13.030 --> 05:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
Regional um and we're sub tenants of
 
05:45:16.350 --> 05:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
them we we um we rent from them um so we
 
05:45:19.150 --> 05:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
have to pay them a rent and also we
 
05:45:21.670 --> 05:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
built in with within that figure is also
 
05:45:24.350 --> 05:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
what's known as hru the human resource
 
05:45:26.990 --> 05:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
support unit um which I have to tell you
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
is a great resource especially if you're
 
05:45:30.310 --> 05:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
a small agency because they deal with
 
05:45:33.350 --> 05:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
all the personel matters that we not may
 
05:45:35.670 --> 05:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
not be accustomed to on a regular basis
 
05:45:38.670 --> 05:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
time cods and and requests on the FMLA
 
05:45:41.110 --> 05:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
or um so again that that is a that's an
 
05:45:42.788 --> 05:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
incredible resource and within there
 
05:45:45.070 --> 05:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
also is granted it's a small figure the
 
05:45:47.670 --> 05:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
EAP employee assistance program so
 
05:45:49.830 --> 05:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's when we look at you know the the
 
05:45:52.310 --> 05:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
actuals for 24 and the appropriation for
 
05:45:55.230 --> 05:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
25 you know what we did was we we we did
 
05:45:58.150 --> 05:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
what we had to to to build the hru into
