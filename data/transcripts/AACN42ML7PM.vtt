00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
i will call this committee a conference
 
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
on house bill 2022 to order
 
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
and if the senate would allow i would i
 
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
would like to just talk briefly about
 
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
the changes yeah
 
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
move sorry about that
 
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
i love this arrangement that we have
 
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.870 align:start position:0%
i love this arrangement that we have
um

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
and just where we could possibly reach
 
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
agreement and where we're not probably
 
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
going to reach some agreements
 
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.550 align:start position:0%
going to reach some agreements
um

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.670 align:start position:0%
um
first

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 1269
 
00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
passed the house
 
00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 align:start position:0%
our last session
 
00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
in that it does eliminate
 
00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.310 align:start position:0%
in that it does eliminate
the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
scenic and cultural
 
00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
byways council so the language that you
 
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
have in there is good to keep something
 
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
going so that the department and and
 
00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
and somebody is looking at at those
 
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
byways now that the council is being
 
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.469 align:start position:0%
byways now that the council is being
disbanded

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
disbanded
 
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
so we
 
00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
that's a good move correct um that was a
 
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 align:start position:0%
recommendation by dot because they're
 
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
doing the the updates and upkeeps anyway
 
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
so while the um
 
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
the committee is no longer there they
 
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
will continue doing the upgrades so
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
that's they had requested that it be in
 
00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
there i i know talking to members who
 
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
who put that 1269 together um they had
 
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
worked for several years on how to which
 
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
councils and commissions to get rid of
 
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
and this was one that had not met for
 
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
years right so um
 
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative ebel called me over the
 
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
weekend to make sure i understood that
 
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
even though i was the co-sponsor of the
 
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.110 align:start position:0%
even though i was the co-sponsor of the
bill

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
the second one uh the remote language
 
00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 align:start position:0%
for the transportation council
 
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
the house would prefer that that
 
00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
meetings of the council itself as far as
 
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
quorum and the rest be removed we have
 
00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 align:start position:0%
either killed or tabled several bills in
 
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
the last couple of weeks that dealt with
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
remote um
 
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
meetings and the
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
reason that we
 
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's i think what is it 14 14 members
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
i'm on the new hampshire transportation
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
council there are 14 members on there
 
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
two of the more most important ones we
 
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.550 align:start position:0%
two of the more most important ones we
have

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
rad nichols
 
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
important part part of it
 
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
so he can't come in now connie crawford
 
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
was recruited to come in by the
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner she's an expert in
 
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
transportation technology and transit
 
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
but she's out of new jersey but she is a
 
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
member so that's why
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain and be able to vote
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
i'd like to keep
 
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
allow those two to
 
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.450 align:start position:0%
allow those two to
um

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.910 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.949 align:start position:0%
[Music]
vote

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
and com part be part of our quorum
 
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
and as i said the house would prefer
 
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
guys

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
guys
 
00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
yeah that's
 
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
there there are a couple others that
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
i've noticed that have gone through
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
we can accept that
 
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:31.350 align:start position:0%
we can accept that
okay

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
now we'll get to the hardwoods
 
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
i know um
 
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
the the floor amendment that was added
 
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
about ev infrastructure funding
 
00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
the house tabled the identity almost
 
00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
identical bill at our last session
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
um the house will insist that that come
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
out of the 10-year plan
 
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
i'll just if i may say a word mr
 
00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
chairman about that is that we did take
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
out the creation of a fund
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
in the this version of the amendment but
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
by any other definition i've talked with
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
house ways and means and house finance
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
and the way it's worded
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
it is a dedicated fund by any other name
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
since it it
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
does not go through fiscal or anything
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
else it just goes to the commissioner
 
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
and out
 
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
we prefer to have it go through the
 
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
existing systems that are there either
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee or the 10-year plan
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chairman i do believe
 
00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
that many of the projects in the 10-year
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
plan is the federal requirements of
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
funding that have sent this to d.o.t to
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
be spent the advantageous
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
advantage of having this language in
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
statute is that it clarifies the
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
priorities which indeed are governor
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
sununu's priorities and how we spend ev
 
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
funding and also clarifies or reinforces
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
the right of the commissioner to hire
 
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
um an outside contractor so it really is
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
kind of practical i think it ran into
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
the kind of anything about eevee is not
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
so good
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh feeling but um
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
there it is i mean the money's gonna get
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
spent anyways but this is a wiser way to
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
the the other thing um that when i did
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
talk to the commissioner um she said
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
granted it's not necessarily needed for
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
the federal funds because the 10-year
 
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
plan actually authorizes them but if
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
there are any grants that are available
 
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
from the state or
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
other grants available
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
they would need they would need some
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
the house still would prefer that that
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay and then the final and then after
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
we'll caucus okay hopefully ruth will be
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
back and and there is one that the house
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
will walk on
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
if it is not included is the
 
00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:10.230 align:start position:0%
if it is not included is the
um

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
ownership of continental boulevard that
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
was fought on the house floor
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
it is the house position
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
and we will defend that house position
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
and as a senate the senate position is
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
to keep it um keep it with the d.o.t
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
at least for the time being
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
um where they still own
 
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.270 align:start position:0%
um where they still own
oh

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
money on it and i think at least for the
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
time being it needs to stay exactly
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
where it is and that's the center
 
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.350 align:start position:0%
where it is and that's the center
position

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
the house and senate seem to be in
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
disagreement i don't think that any of
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
the house members are going to change
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
so i think our continuing to to meet is
 
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.510 align:start position:0%
so i think our continuing to to meet is
probably

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.309 align:start position:0%
probably
counterproductive

00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
counterproductive
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
all right we're we're back in session
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
that there is still no agreement on
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
either of those two
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
issues i assume senator
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
uh we will we will pull out the um ev
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
fund okay thank you so the the the sole
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
issue that is left for a resolution
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
is the ownership of continental
 
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.310 align:start position:0%
is the ownership of continental
boulevard

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
boulevard
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
um we all need to take a break for a
 
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.910 align:start position:0%
um we all need to take a break for a
minute

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
minute
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
um i would suggest
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
if the senate is amenable
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
to a 10 30 uh meeting on wednesday may
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
18th uh room to be determined because i
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
don't have this room full time uh
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
is that amenable
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
to and it's amenable to the house
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
and i think both of us will be talking
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
with our respective leadership um so
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
with that the committee of conference on
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 2022
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
is in recess
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
until wednesday
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
at 10 30 a.m thank you all for coming
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
