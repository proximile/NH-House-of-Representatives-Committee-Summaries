we get to that I want to explain the
 
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
rest of the day
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
starting at 10 o'clock we've asked the
 
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
department of energy to do a
 
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
presentation on the department
 
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
what its functions are what its mission
 
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
our original schedule called for the
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission do it do a
 
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
similar presentation from one to three
 
00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 align:start position:0%
or one to two thirty
 
00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
however yesterday I was informed by the
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
chair of the commission that illness has
 
00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 align:start position:0%
struck the commission and so if they
 
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
have asked for a rescheduling so we will
 
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
be here hearing from the Public
 
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission at a later date I
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact date at this point
 
00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
in time we have to come up with a
 
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
reschedule to fit them in
 
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
once I discovered that I asked the
 
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate if he could move up
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
from his position at 2 30 to 1 o'clock
 
00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 align:start position:0%
and he uh being a a great gentleman
 
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
agreed to that and so we'll be hearing
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
from the consumer Advocate after lunch
 
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 align:start position:0%

policy and making sure that we make good
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
decisions moving forward so that we can

gains on environmental issues
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%

Stratford 18 which is now made up of
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
Middleton New Durham Stratford and
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
Barrington it's a kind of a new district

for me I represented Stratford and New
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
Durham in the past uh this will be my
 
00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
fifth uh time on Science and Tech my
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
sixth term in the house I'm a nuclear
 
00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
engineer a member of marriages of the
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
American nuclear society which I've
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
actually been a member of longer than
 
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
I've done anything else including my
 
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
marriage of 44 years
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
um as stated before my concerns is the
 
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:12.059 align:start position:0%
price of electricity and energy I
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
realize it's limited to what we can do
 
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
but we want to make sure what we do do
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
doesn't make things more expensive and
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be looking out for special
 
00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:21.539 align:start position:0%
interest groups the only special
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
interest groups we consider are the
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
voters and the rate payers because they
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
get the short end of the stick most of
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
the time because they can't spend a lot
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
of money on lobbyists to come up here
 
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
and try to get people to vote money into
 
00:27:36.649 --> 00:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harrington so
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
now we all know who the players are
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
and so let's talk a little bit about
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
what the game is uh involved with
 
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.460 align:start position:0%

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
iPads or tablets are not allowed on
 
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
committee tables
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
the only electronic devices that we're
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
going to allow on committee tables are
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
iPhones and other uh
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
types of phones
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're discouraged from using your phone
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
except for
 
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.510 align:start position:0%
except for
um

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
minimalist tasks like responding to a
 
00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:18.059 align:start position:0%
text that you think is important or
 
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:21.260 align:start position:0%
responding to an email that is critical
 
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
for the most part however we would
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate you don't look at your phone
 
00:31:29.289 --> 00:31:29.299 align:start position:0%
the reason for these
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
prescriptions by the speaker are that it
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
is disrespectful to the people who are
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
testifying and presenting before the
 
00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.830 align:start position:0%
testifying and presenting before the
committee

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
for members to be distracted by their
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
electronic devices
 
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
so the speaker
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
urges us all to refrain from using those
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
electronic devices
 
00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:57.409 align:start position:0%
electronic devices
unless

00:31:57.409 --> 00:31:57.419 align:start position:0%
unless
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
there is a critical need to do so
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
you can always take your electronic
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
device and leave the committee room
 
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.419 align:start position:0%
and do some work outside in the hallway
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
but we want you to be respectful of the
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
public be respectful of the people who
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
come to present before us
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
by paying attention to what they have to
 
00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:24.299 align:start position:0%
say and not losing
 
00:32:27.409 --> 00:32:27.419 align:start position:0%
track of what's going on by being
 
00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
preoccupied with your electronic devices
 
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
representative McGee did you have a
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
question yes I did thank you Mr chairman
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
um I am just questioning the decision
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
for the science technology and energy
 
00:32:42.289 --> 00:32:42.299 align:start position:0%
committee to not be able to use
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
technology in our hearings because I
 
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.669 align:start position:0%
technology in our hearings because I
think

00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
whether folks are paying sufficient
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
respect and attention to those that are
 
00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:51.289 align:start position:0%
respect and attention to those that are
testifying

00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:51.299 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
would come down to a Personnel issue if
 
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
someone really wasn't paying attention
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the hearings I think that's a
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
different issue than actually having
 
00:33:02.169 --> 00:33:02.179 align:start position:0%
access to technology
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
in what what are full days for us here
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
in Concord so I would I would like to
 
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:09.539 align:start position:0%
push back and even speak with the
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
speaker's office if I could about
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
having an exception for the science
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee I mean I
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
think many of us here have laptops and
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
devices today that I used just this
 
00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:24.059 align:start position:0%
morning to let you know that Dr creation
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
was unable to attend because of an
 
00:33:25.919 --> 00:33:27.470 align:start position:0%
was unable to attend because of an
illness

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
illness
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
um and we got that as a late breaking
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
note to the committee so I just think
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons why people would
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
want to have technology and I think that
 
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
this committee should advocate for that
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
um you know take it that we uh do not
 
00:33:45.409 --> 00:33:45.419 align:start position:0%
need technology in order to perform our
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
job sufficiently
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and listen close
 
00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
because you're not going to hear this
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
too often but I 100 agree with
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
um I think that that is a silly Rule and
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
I think we should push back on it I use
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
reference to uh Vice chair Thomas's uh
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
email that was sent out that said we
 
00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
should be familiar with the 10-year
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
energy plan and the department of energy
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
so forth uh do you expect this to print
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
these out or all copies of these going
 
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
to be printed out in the of to
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
distribute to the entire committee so we
 
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
can look at them or otherwise we could
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
just simply pull them up on our computer
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh I really think we should push back on
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
this and say this I don't know what his
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
point is to thinking people being
 
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
offended uh if someone's acting
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
obnoxiously then this chair could just
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
simply say can you kind of knock it off
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
you're not paying attention to anybody
 
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
all you do is stick your nose in your
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
computer but to say that if you want to
 
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
look up something and when you're like
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
talking to the Department of energy
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
about the 10-year energy plan until
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
referring to page 22 this line I have a
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
question on it we won't be able to do
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
that unless we all print out paper
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
copies and if you're reading a paper
 
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
copy is that any more obnoxious than
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
reading it something like a computer I
 
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
just don't get this it's no there's no
 
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
sense to this whatsoever
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
and I think we should push back to the
 
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
speaker's office on it thank you for
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
that comment representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to know if there are any
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
medical accommodations for laptops in
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
this committee um I have arthritis in my
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
hands and I can type far easier than I
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
can write with a pen
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
all those are are good comments and the
 
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
root of this policy is decorum it's
 
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.569 align:start position:0%
root of this policy is decorum it's
being

00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
attentive to and polite to the people
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's likely going to be necessary that
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
you if you have a tablet or a laptop
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
that you keep it
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
concealed to the best of your ability so
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
that the people who are speaking to us
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
will think that they have our attention
 
00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:04.140 align:start position:0%
now that doesn't mean you can't use your
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
device between speakers
 
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.910 align:start position:0%
device between speakers
or

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
during breaks or take it out into the
 
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:14.099 align:start position:0%
hallway and use it whenever you feel you
 
00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
but we want to discourage
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
the ongoing use while people are sitting
 
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
before us testifying and presenting of
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
these electronic devices if you need
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
them to take notes
 
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.190 align:start position:0%
them to take notes
then

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
use them
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
but do it in a way that
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
is respectful of the people who are
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
making presentations to us
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
don't do it in a way that makes them sit
 
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
there and wonder
 
00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
what's this person doing are they
 
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
listening to anything I'm saying
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
that's the the basis for this policy
 
00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:57.500 align:start position:0%
it's not that we're
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
luddites that were anti-technology which
 
00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:02.579 align:start position:0%
would be ironic for a committee such as
 
00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:03.890 align:start position:0%
would be ironic for a committee such as
ours

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
ours
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
it's that we're being respectful to the
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
people who come before us they have
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
important things to say to us and they'd
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
like to be assured that they're being
 
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.370 align:start position:0%
like to be assured that they're being
heard

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
did you have a comment representative
 
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
Reynolds yes Mr chairman thank you I I
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
agree with you and I think I don't think
 
00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
anybody on the committee would disagree
 
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.530 align:start position:0%
anybody on the committee would disagree
that

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
we should all be respectful and
 
00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:32.300 align:start position:0%
appreciative of
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
folks who come to testify before us and
 
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
present to us and I think that
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
when someone's using technology
 
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
to either take notes
 
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
about what some what somebody is saying
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
or to look something up for reference
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
and perhaps ask a question based on it
 
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
and someone sitting there
 
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
doing email all day typing typing typing
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
typing so I hope we can
 
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.150 align:start position:0%
typing so I hope we can
um

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
honor the speakers intent while also
 
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:10.970 align:start position:0%
honor the speakers intent while also
um

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
you know as the Science Tech and energy
 
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that technology is something
 
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
that enhances our lives and is not a
 
00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
mere distraction
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that comment let's
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
move on we'll be keeping an eye on this
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
as the year develops and hopefully we
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
won't have to deal with any
 
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.710 align:start position:0%
won't have to deal with any
significant

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
violations of the basic precepts of this
 
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.430 align:start position:0%
violations of the basic precepts of this
policy

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
one more quick comment
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Gorman
 
00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I taught as I said
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
the introductory computer science course
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
many times and I had to deal with this
 
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
issue of students using their laptops
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
and not paying attention I tried various
 
00:38:59.810 --> 00:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
policies and all I want to say is I
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
would like to think that the
 
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
representatives on this committee are a
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
lot more mature than college students
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
and a lot more responsible so I would
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
hope to to think that we would all be
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
using our laptops for the correct
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
purpose and not shopping and not
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
watching basketball games
 
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right let's move on
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
um next item on my list here is each of
 
00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
you will be given a drawer in the little
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
office off to the
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
behind that second clock
 
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
um where you can keep the materials that
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
you'll be getting during the course of
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
our business over the next few months
 
00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:44.099 align:start position:0%
and you'll be getting a lot of it you'll
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
be getting a lot of written testimony
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
submitted by people testifying on bills
 
00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:52.099 align:start position:0%
you'll be getting a lot of illustrative
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
materials you'll be getting copies of
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
all the bills so you're going to have a
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
a need to find a place to put all this
 
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
stuff so you'll have a drawer assigned
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
to you in that back office and I urge
 
00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339 align:start position:0%
you to use it and
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
um keep it neat and keep all your
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
materials together so you can access
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
them easily
 
00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.810 align:start position:0%
them easily
the

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
end three seats over here on this on my
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
left in the committee are assigned for
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
security notifications so I'll be
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
talking to the three representatives
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
there about security issues should they
 
00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:40.849 --> 00:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
as you probably are well aware by now we
 
00:40:40.859 --> 00:40:42.849 align:start position:0%
as you probably are well aware by now we
have

00:40:42.849 --> 00:40:42.859 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
a partisan balance on this committee we
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
have 10 Democratic members and we have
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
10 Republican members
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
I have chosen a seating arrangement for
 
00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:59.990 align:start position:0%
the committee
that

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
I think will work for us
 
00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
the speaker has requested that we
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
alternate Republicans and Democrats
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
wherever possible this year
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
and so I've tried to do that
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
within the constraints of having the
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
leadership group here together up at the
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
the kinds of build topics that we
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
typically get in this committee are
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
mostly energy topics we don't get a lot
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
of raw science or raw technology kind of
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
bills it's mostly energy
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
that may require at some point in the
 
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
distant future a a change of the title
 
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
of this committee I don't know but for
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
now it's primarily an energy committee
 
00:41:53.329 --> 00:41:53.339 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas in a few minutes
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
is going to talk a little bit about
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
second committee work and subcommittees
 
00:41:59.810 --> 00:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
calendars and notices all of our
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
meetings will be noticed in the calendar
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
at least three business days before the
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
date of the meeting
 
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
so that is your your first point of
 
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
reference to find out when we're meeting
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
I will try to keep you informed
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
at the end of a current meeting I'll
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
I'll mention when our next meeting is
 
00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:21.530 align:start position:0%
I'll mention when our next meeting is
scheduled

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
but you should
 
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
always rely on our calendar for the
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
final word on when uh we'll be meeting
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
the files that you put together on
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
individual bills are supposed to be kept
 
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
in this building they're not supposed to
 
00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:41.579 align:start position:0%
leave the building
 
00:42:41.579 --> 00:42:42.950 align:start position:0%
leave the building
and

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
with those Basic Ground rules in place
 
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn it over to
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas to talk about
 
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
the public hearing process so
 
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
representation excuse me Mr chairman
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
could I give us a comment I'm a little
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
confused by one of your last statements
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
there we're not allowed to take stuff
 
00:43:02.089 --> 00:43:02.099 align:start position:0%
home with us I mean this is some I've
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
never heard this I've been my sixth term
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
never heard you were not allowed to take
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
information home with you I mean it is a
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
rule of the house that Bill files are
 
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
not supposed to leave the building I
 
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of it either but
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has more info
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
right well I I believe that refers to
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
the official files that the uh that are
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
assistant has that that is kept here
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
your own notes your own notes and then
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
and and copies of bills obviously can be
 
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
taken home I believe that's what this
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
refers to it's poorly worded I believe
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification I
 
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm on thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
I'll hurry on because we're running out
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
of time here uh just uh
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
on public hearings on the scheduled
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
hearings if we have an unexpected large
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
crowd that comes to this room uh we will
 
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
contact our assistant and they have a
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
protocol set up to move us to a larger
 
00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:05.950 align:start position:0%
protocol set up to move us to a larger
place

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
on that day however if you happen to
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
know because
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
you have an end with
 
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
the internet that there is going to be a
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
very large crowd here it would be
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
helpful to know that in advance just to
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
avoid wasting some time
 
00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.370 align:start position:0%
avoid wasting some time
um

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
and of course on any any recesses that
 
00:44:28.809 --> 00:44:28.819 align:start position:0%
are called for public hearings will be
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
rescheduled to a date and time certain
 
00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:35.060 align:start position:0%
so that we know when we're going to be
 
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
reconvening again I'd like to talk a
 
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
little bit about the uh organizing the
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
speakers and I believe this topic is
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
very important this year and I think
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to try and hold to it just
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
as closely as we possibly can
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
the famous pink cards
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
the pink cards are really important to
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
be turned in
 
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
as soon as you come into this room
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
they should be given directly to the the
 
00:45:01.079 --> 00:45:02.210 align:start position:0%
they should be given directly to the the
chair

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
and they should be filled out uh don't
 
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
be wordy but it should they should be
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
filled out so that we know who you are
 
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
who you represent and what your topic is
 
00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
but the main point I'll talk to now is
 
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
we may have situations where we may have
 
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
a large amount of ping cards everybody
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
will have a chance to speak
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
we want to allot a fair time to
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
everybody to speak
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
if we only have 45 minutes then we have
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
two pink cards we know how much time we
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
can give each speaker if we have 30
 
00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:42.140 align:start position:0%
speakers we're going to to drastically
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
alternate that time per speaker so
 
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
everyone has a chance to speak
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
if someone comes in late or if they
 
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
decide they're going to put a pink card
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
in later after we decided how much time
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
to give each person to speak they are
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
going to be subject to time remaining
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh they their time to speak could be
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
much less so please get your cards in
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
early so we can have a fair opportunity
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
to a lot naturally if a topic is that
 
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.530 align:start position:0%
to a lot naturally if a topic is that
that

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
deep and developed and we obviously are
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to need much more time the chair
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
may make a decision to recess to a Time
 
00:46:23.089 --> 00:46:23.099 align:start position:0%
certain so we can have more time to
 
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
discuss the actual bill so please get
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
your pink cards in early and please tell
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
your internet friends to do the same
 
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:31.980 align:start position:0%
thing too if they're going to come here
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
we'd appreciate that yes representative
 
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.270 align:start position:0%
we'd appreciate that yes representative
McGee

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
McGee
 
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Thomas my
 
00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:43.140 align:start position:0%
question is if we will know in advance
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
that a particular Bill might be more
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
controversial than another will we be
 
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
scheduling additional time or will they
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
all be uniform regardless of whether we
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
can anticipate that they might be more
 
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
well attended than others
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
I think there'll be a question for the
 
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
as we've done in the past we'll try to
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
give more time to build subjects that we
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
think will be will be controversial yes
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
moving on um and uh as we've come as
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
we've covered before in the past
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
sponsors are generally recognized first
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
to speak and introduce the bill
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
um followed by other representatives and
 
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.030 align:start position:0%
um followed by other representatives and
um

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh let's see uh and we will try to the
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
best of our ability and depending on who
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
is coming in to speak we will try to
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
alternate between pros and cons speakers
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
if they so designate on their print card
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
or even if they're neutral will it will
 
00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.750 align:start position:0%
or even if they're neutral will it will
alternate

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
alternate
 
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
we will announce a lunch break depending
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
on the type of Bill and how much time we
 
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
think we have uh it will depend on the
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
exact time of the lunch break
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to take a little bit about
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
we're following some rules that we're
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
given here in our training it says we
 
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
ask people to remove stickers or buttons
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
as they come in here that show advocacy
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
so uh so please inform your groups they
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
should be doing that we know that we do
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
not allow any signs in the committee
 
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.470 align:start position:0%
not allow any signs in the committee
room

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:26.099 align:start position:0%
they should be kept outside if at all
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
possible they certainly shall not be
 
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
held up displayed in any way while we're
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
um let's see we covered the drinks thing
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
we covered the time testimony that's
 
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.730 align:start position:0%
we covered the time testimony that's
good

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
um oh questions from committee members
 
00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.950 align:start position:0%
um oh questions from committee members
again

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
this year we are going to be very formal
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
now that we're coming back to normal
 
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
times after the pandemic
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
this is a Science and Tech committee
 
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
we expect that both testimony and
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
questions should be factually based so
 
00:49:07.849 --> 00:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
therefore our request to our members is
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
to ask questions that are for
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
information or for clarification on what
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
is being testified and I think a fair
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
question would be if someone is
 
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
expressing an opinion then a fair
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
question might be where did you get your
 
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
opinion from do you have some reference
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
point as to uh as so we can check the
 
00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
facts on that so we will not be allowing
 
00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.050 align:start position:0%
facts on that so we will not be allowing
any

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.430 align:start position:0%
would you believe
questions

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
and or any questions that would be
 
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
leading the the testifier this is not a
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
courtroom and unfortunately we are on
 
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
streaming so we don't want any show
 
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
voting uh with certain uh types of
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
questions they are for information and
 
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
and for facts we can better make
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
decisions on each of these bills I think
 
00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
we're going to try our best to uh you
 
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
um written testimony should be given to
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
the to the clerk after your testimony
 
00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
and please if you have written testimony
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
we do not want you to read your written
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
testimony it uh for time purposes please
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
just summarize it for us please or if
 
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
you have new information that's not in
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
your new testimony in your written
 
00:50:31.079 --> 00:50:34.309 align:start position:0%
your new testimony in your written
testimony

00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.319 --> 00:50:35.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
Let's see we talked about security oh
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
yes uh co-sponsors or sponsors of bills
 
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and sponsors that are
 
00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
members on this committee
 
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
can testify and they will be allowed to
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
come back and sit in their seat but they
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
will not be allowed to ask questions on
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
uh testimony is not accepted by email
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
only paper copies of testimony letters
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
or other documents that are delivered by
 
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
hand or U.S commercial mail are required
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
to be included in the public record
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
for official files
 
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative McGee yep I just I
 
00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:29.819 align:start position:0%
just uh would like to take exception to
 
00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
that and wonder whether we can vote on
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
any of these rules because the idea of
 
00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:37.220 align:start position:0%
not allowing electronic testimony seems
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh antithetical to being a science
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee I think
 
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of people do present their
 
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
testimonies that way and it's a
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
convenience for the public to be able to
 
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
express their positions so if we don't
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
allow it uh it's really discouraging
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
people from participating in the process
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
where maybe I jump in here we're not
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
discouraging electronic testimony we're
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
just discouraging email testimony we
 
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
have a established process within the
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
house about how to submit electronic
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and we're asking people to
 
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
follow that assistance so that will
 
00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
still be allowed yeah yes okay okay
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
great thanks thank you I I was going to
 
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
come with that on my next sentence
 
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
saying that the online testimony
 
00:52:19.609 --> 00:52:19.619 align:start position:0%
submission tool may be used to submit
 
00:52:19.619 --> 00:52:21.589 align:start position:0%
submission tool may be used to submit
testimony

00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative Harrington uh maybe I
 
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
misunderstood you or maybe I'm just
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
confused you said something about
 
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors I thought we had the rule
 
00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
now allowed a co-sponsor to make a
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
decision they could either speak in
 
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill or they could stay at
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
their seat and then ask questions but
 
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do both
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
the way you put it is like if you're a
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor you can speak and that's it
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
well I'm going off the training that we
 
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
have here on what we were supposed to
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
present to the committee I reversed my
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
memory I believe that rule or subject
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
was brought up at the last session but
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
did we vote on that in favor of that I
 
00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:01.940 align:start position:0%
thought we did but I could be wrong
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
we need to check that because I thought
 
00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
it was I thought you had the option
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
a really quick uh subcommittees uh
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
nothing really changes here
 
00:53:16.619 --> 00:53:20.329 align:start position:0%
nothing really changes here
um

00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
we just want more more timely action if
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%

because we have reached the end of our
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
organization meeting scheduled time and
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
the department of energies put a lot of
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
time and effort into preparing their
 
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.460 align:start position:0%

organizational session and we'll call on
 
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
minutes but for right now we're in
 
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:04.740 align:start position:0%

presentation by the department of energy
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
I mentioned right before we broke for
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
recess that we had more information to
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%

01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:42.180 align:start position:0%

is is New Hampshire's new estate agency
 
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:14.940 align:start position:0%
at this time two years ago the
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
department did not exist in the previous
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
budget governor sununu and the
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
legislature created the department to
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
quote provide unified direction of

field of energy end quote and to make
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
possible increased efficiencies in the

administration of energy related
 
01:04:34.010 --> 01:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
functions of the executive branch
 
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
given the recent energy related
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
challenges that have uh bubbled up in
 
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
the United States and New England and
 
01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire globally the legislature
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
and the governor's move to emphasize
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
energy in state government was quite
 
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.670 align:start position:0%
energy in state government was quite
timely

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
timely
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
the reorganization
 
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:52.740 align:start position:0%
moved most of the staff of the Public
 
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and the office of
 
01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives formerly the
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
office of energy and planning to the
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
Department of energy
 
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
the office of strategic initiatives was
 
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
dissolved and streamlined and the
 
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
streamlined puc was administratively
 
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
attached to the department as was the
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
Office of Consumer Advocate and the site
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
part of the intent of the legislation
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
was to allow the puc to focus on their
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
regulatory adjudicative responsibilities
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
and to make clear the separation between
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
the state's regulatory advocacy role and
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
the impartial role that the puc plays
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
the department of energy is a large and

policy direction as laid out in the
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
10-year State energy strategy which our

dissolved and we'll just take a minute
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
to look at each of those divisions

01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
party at the puc and helps build the
 
01:08:17.150 --> 01:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
record in those proceedings and
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
advocates for the public interest

the division of enforcement enforces
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
compliance with safety related laws
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%

position I would just add was created
 
01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.110 align:start position:0%
position I would just add was created
um

01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
in the budget in the last budget that
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
position is now filled and we're excited
 
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
about this new role that we have at the
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
department the division maintains a Gis
 
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
for critical and major energy and
 
01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications infrastructure and
 
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
participates in emergency preparedness
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
and response
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
so when there was a recent uh winter
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
storm that created
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
many outages our team obviously works
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
with the utilities as the state agency
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
to monitor the status of those outages
 
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:28.140 align:start position:0%
and restoration
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
finally we have the division of
 
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
administration which is led by director
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
Rory Patterson the division convinced
 
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
consists excuse me of the legal staff
 
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
who participate in puc proceedings and
 
01:09:41.329 --> 01:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
provide legal support to other divisions
 
01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
the division also houses our business
 
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
office and grants compliance staff
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
we briefly mentioned the administrative
 
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
attachment of the puc office of the
 
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate and site evaluation
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
committee to the department through that
 
01:09:59.209 --> 01:09:59.219 align:start position:0%
attachment our business office provides
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
back office support to those agencies
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
and that's essentially what that is
 
01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:06.620 align:start position:0%
we don't tell those agencies what to do
 
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
we just help them pay their bills
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
process invoices and provide other types
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
of back office support
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
so that's the department structure
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
before we turn it over to to Tom Franz I
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
want to just take a few minutes to touch
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
on some of the Department of Energy's
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
particip participation in Regional
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
activities uh particularly related to
 
01:10:27.239 --> 01:10:28.390 align:start position:0%
activities uh particularly related to
electricity

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of what we'll touch on will make
 
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
more sense after you hear from ISO New
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
England and we'll be happy to follow up
 
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
after that of course when it comes to
 
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
electricity it's it's very important to
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
note that New Hampshire is closely
 
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
connected with our neighbors each of the
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
New England states is part of the same
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
electric grid that is operated by ISO
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
New England
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh ISO New England has a three-part
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
mandate operate the grid plan for future
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
electric power requirements and design
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
and administer the wholesale electricity
 
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
markets ice and New England will talk
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
more about the electric markets but the
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
markets are the way that most of the
 
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
electric electric generation New
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh gets its Revenue excuse me
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
New England gets its Revenue
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh the the decisions of one or a few
 
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
States impacts the whole so there's a
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
great deal of discussion coordination
 
01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
and negotiation between the states the
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy much
 
01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
of this happens at the New England
 
01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:25.820 align:start position:0%
states committee on electricity Nesco
 
01:11:29.209 --> 01:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
where each state is represented of the
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
New England states New Hampshire has
 
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
been the most Market oriented
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
we have supported well-designed markets
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
and the competitive outcomes that they
 
01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:38.450 align:start position:0%
and the competitive outcomes that they
provide

01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
we have advocated for policies that
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
allow Market principles to drive
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
investment and oppose policies that
 
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
distort markets and inhibit price
 
01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.750 align:start position:0%
distort markets and inhibit price
signals

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
signals
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
we have opposed Regional efforts that
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
unreasonably shift costs to New
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rate payers and we will
 
01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
continue to do so in fact we have a
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
statutory mandate to do just that as you
 
01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
New England is facing
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
um some very real challenges both in
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
terms of reliability and cost
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
we've all seen our electric bills
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
increase over the course of the last
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
year and ISO New England has warned that
 
01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:19.100 align:start position:0%
a severe enough winter could lead to
 
01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
electricity shortages
 
01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:24.020 align:start position:0%
so let's talk briefly about reliability
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
over the last decade about 7000
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
megawatts of electric generation have
 
01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
gone offline many of which might be
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
considered to be more reliable resources
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
many of the resources needed for
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
reliability-based Market uncertainty
 
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
despite their necessity to the grid
 
01:12:43.850 --> 01:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
this is in part because of out-of-market
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
actions that other states have
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
undertaken to meet their decarbonization
 
01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
goals and have introduced distortions
 
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
that affect those resources that require
 
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
Market revenues
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
to stay economical
 
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
there's another problem that underlies
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
many of the issues we deal with
 
01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.450 align:start position:0%
many of the issues we deal with
regionally

01:12:59.450 --> 01:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
regionally
 
01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:01.340 align:start position:0%
New England is reliant on natural gas
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
but for a variety of reasons has limited
 
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
supply of domestic domestic natural gas
 
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
because of pipeline constraints I'm sure
 
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
many of you have heard that in the news
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of months
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
this has led to more dependence on
 
01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
liquefied natural gas for our peak times
 
01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
than other regions of the country have
 
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
had so it's it's a very uh it's a
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
problem that's unique to New England
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
um the problem has only been exacerbated
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
by global natural gas prices being
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
driven by
 
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
extreme um or excuse me by International
 
01:13:36.649 --> 01:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
factors such as the invasion of Ukraine
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
and the economic effects coming out of
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic
 
01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
next slide this slide that we borrowed
 
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
from my ISO New England is illustrative
 
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
on how closely the wholesale price of
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
electricity in New England is tied to
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
the price of natural gas it also shows
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
both historical prices and makes clear
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
some of the volatility in the markets I
 
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
thought they'd be a very helpful slide
 
01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
for all of you
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
um this this next slide also from ISO
 
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
New England gives you a sense of scale
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
of the New England Electric market 2022
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
will probably look a lot uh or look more
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
like 2008 than previous years
 
01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.870 align:start position:0%
like 2008 than previous years
um

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.090 align:start position:0%
um
okay

01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna stop there
 
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.570 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna stop there
um

01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
please visit our website we have this
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
slide here it's up to date we try to do
 
01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
our best to make sure that the
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
information is up to date and relevant
 
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
for consumers and of course for policy
 
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
makers with that we'd be happy to take
 
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:43.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas is recognized
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
Douglas Thomas is recognized for a

01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm I'm the taller
 
01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.490 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm I'm the taller
one

01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.149 align:start position:0%
one
um

01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony I just
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
just kind of curious could you give us
 
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
just a little more insight on
 
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
how Nesco can affect the residents here
 
01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
sure so the New England states committee
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
on electricity uh it's essentially
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
um we represent the governors our
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
respective Governors and um we
 
01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
as a group we discussed the challenges
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
facing the region as it relates to to
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
electricity and the regional grid and
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
markets and um
 
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know although we are not voting
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
members of of Nepal
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
um are uh
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
our position
 
01:15:44.209 --> 01:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
we represent the states the governors
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
um that position is whatever position we
 
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
take on any issue
 
01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
uh regionally you know that is taken
 
01:15:54.169 --> 01:15:54.179 align:start position:0%
into consideration by ISO New England
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
and and other uh you know Market
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
participants so I think it's very
 
01:15:58.980 --> 01:15:59.990 align:start position:0%
participants so I think it's very
important

01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
um for our state where we don't have we
 
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
don't share some of the same goals as
 
01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
our neighbors it's a very important
 
01:16:07.739 --> 01:16:08.570 align:start position:0%
our neighbors it's a very important
um

01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
platform for us to
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
to emphasize what New Hampshire's
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
policies are as it relates to
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
electricity and and to advocate for
 
01:16:19.199 --> 01:16:20.510 align:start position:0%
electricity and and to advocate for
ourselves

01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
um with our with our neighbors and and
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
we do that in a way that's um respectful
 
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
and uh collegial at it's it's uh it is a
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
good group
 
01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
um but again we have differences with
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
our neighbors and we do our very best to
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
represent our interests there
 
01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
um so positions that Nesco takes on a
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
variety of issues
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
um we make sure that if we're not in 100
 
01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
agreement the state of New Hampshire
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
that that is noted in any policy
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
statement that's issued by the group at
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
times you'll notice there are footnotes
 
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
um to letters that that Nesco issues
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
with a particular statement
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
um and there may be a footnote that says
 
01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has this particular
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
position that differs from the other
 
01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
states so it is uh the the participation
 
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
in that group is is very valuable I
 
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
believe to New Hampshire and its rate
 
01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.570 align:start position:0%
believe to New Hampshire and its rate
pairs

01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh uh thank you really quick
 
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
do they have a binding uh
 
01:17:25.729 --> 01:17:25.739 align:start position:0%
set of rules that or can they directly
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
affect our rates here in New Hampshire
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
for our our residents and and industries
 
01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.750 align:start position:0%
for our our residents and and industries
Nesco

01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
Nesco
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
that's cool
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
not it not as an organization no
 
01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:40.090 align:start position:0%
not it not as an organization no
um

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
sorry no it's it's um again we we take a
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
position as a group uh typically we're
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
all on the same page as States
 
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
um but uh you know I I guess I would say
 
01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:53.300 align:start position:0%
that if we were to
 
01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
advance a policy support a policy that
 
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
had impacts on the Region's rate payers
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
um yes I guess that could be the case
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking though
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um I'm going to
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
ask the the nasty question I guess given
 
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
the what's happened uh over Christmas
 
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
day we went into an op4 event we came
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
close to blackouts uh we're looking two
 
01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
years in the future the two Mystic
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
plants are going to close their RMR
 
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
plants right now and probably District
 
01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
gas is going to go away as well at least
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
what's the plan to make sure we have
 
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
sufficient LNG uh two years from now
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
when those two plants close and there's
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
no you know there's just a gas it loses
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
60 percent of their Market
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
I know it's a tough question that's a
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
great question
 
01:18:45.719 --> 01:18:47.450 align:start position:0%
great question
um

01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
you know the the there is an inventory
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
to energy program that will roll out
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
next winter
 
01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
um that that may provide
 
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
um some security there
 
01:18:58.260 --> 01:18:59.090 align:start position:0%
um some security there
um

01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
the Mystic agreement last through next
 
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
winter it's it's that's it
 
01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:05.810 align:start position:0%
winter it's it's that's it
um

01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
I I don't know
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a real challenge
 
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
um as I'm sure all of you are aware uh
 
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
it is very difficult to when it comes to
 
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
Natural Gas to expand pipeline capacity
 
01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:19.580 align:start position:0%
into the region there are a number of
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
regional and local challenges to doing
 
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
that so we will be reliant on liquefied
 
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
natural gas for some time
 
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
where it all lands in a couple years I I
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
um but it is it's a serious challenge
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the region quick follow-up well if I
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
just may continue on that representative
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
there are a great deal of conversations
 
01:19:44.689 --> 01:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
and analyzes happening you know looking
 
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
at topics from uh you know increasing
 
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
energy storage in the region or or
 
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
reserves to you know looking at
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
different Market mechanisms that might
 
01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:55.739 align:start position:0%
help so when we say we don't know
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
there's no easy solution but there are a
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
great deal of uh resources and and
 
01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:03.110 align:start position:0%
great deal of uh resources and and
conversations

01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
um efforts being undertaken to find
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
Solutions right and we are working with
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
um on what's the most solutions could
 
01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:11.699 align:start position:0%
look like but obviously that takes time
 
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
and it would have to work its way
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
through Congress if there was an
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
appropriation needed and follow-up uh
 
01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:20.219 align:start position:0%
representative thank you chairman just
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
on that same subject with the minimum
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
offer price rule being going away in two
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
years uh and the fact that we looked at
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
the the last week of the year here where
 
01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
sometimes we had 40 of our electricity
 
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
being produced by oil and those plants
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
rely on capacity payments is there any
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
effort now to suspend that getting rid
 
01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
of that minimum offer price so those oil
 
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
plants will be around when we need them
 
01:20:45.169 --> 01:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
five years from now
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
with the current composition of of ferc
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
I I don't think bringing back we did we
 
01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
did not support elimination of the moper
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
um but with the the current composition
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
of ferc
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
um I I don't see the moper coming back
 
01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
and just uh sorry to to continue on that
 
01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
there are obviously a lot of
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
conversations related to other Market
 
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.729 align:start position:0%
conversations related to other Market
changes

01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
um in light of the mocha elimination
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
that that might be able to more
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
effectively you know keep keep places uh
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
plants online
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative muns have us a question
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and Mr
 
01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you for your service
 
01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
um I had a question
 
01:21:34.370 --> 01:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
um on page 14 of your
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
um uh presentation
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
um you made a there's a comment about
 
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the most Market
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
oriented of New Hampshire States
 
01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
um markets are characterized by risks
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
and Rewards
 
01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:52.940 align:start position:0%
um so I would assume that as the most
 
01:21:55.209 --> 01:21:55.219 align:start position:0%
market-oriented State
 
01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
we may be more
 
01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:58.970 align:start position:0%
we may be more
um

01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:02.219 align:start position:0%
susceptible to those risks and rewards
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
can you can you characterize how
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire compares to other states
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know prices Supply
 
01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.229 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know prices Supply
Etc

01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
sure I'll take that if you don't mind
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
um one of the benefits of sort of the
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
market oriented approach is that
 
01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
um with the restructured electricity
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
markets right now generators would bear
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
the business risks in participation in
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
the markets by relying more on wholesale
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
markets that allows the states to shift
 
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
that business risk to generators rather
 
01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
than rate payers when States take out of
 
01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
than rate payers when States take out of
Market

01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
Market
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
um you know solutions to try to
 
01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
encourage other generation you know
 
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
again outside of that market that risk
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
gets transferred to rate payers uh and
 
01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:56.219 align:start position:0%
and so New Hampshire's market-oriented
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
approach is actually one of the benefits
 
01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
is is keeping that risk off of New
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's right payers to to the
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah thank you Mr chairman
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
um I I guess what I was thinking about
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
more was
 
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:16.580 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
susceptibility that New Hampshire
 
01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:21.169 align:start position:0%
susceptibility that New Hampshire
um

01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:23.689 --> 01:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
uh gets exposed to or the issue the risk
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire gets exposed to
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
um when there are uh dramatic shifts
 
01:23:30.169 --> 01:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
such as what we're seeing right now in
 
01:23:32.209 --> 01:23:32.219 align:start position:0%
the international markets where you know
 
01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
Supply is a a challenge I mean Are we
 
01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
more at risk because of our Mark our our
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
more Market oriented approach than other
 
01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
states New England
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
so so right now I mean and that's a good
 
01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
point um on the uh on sort of the
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
volatility that we might be exposed to
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
um what we've seen is that all all the
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
New England states are experiencing that
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
volatility a lot of the out of Market
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
um you know uh solutions that other
 
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
states have pursued for other policy
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
goals uh have sought attributes other
 
01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
than reliability or cost they've been
 
01:24:08.090 --> 01:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
more focused on either environmental
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
goals or Economic Development goals
 
01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:14.219 align:start position:0%
um and and where the costs come in are
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
are sort of at those peak times you know
 
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
times during the winter uh where the
 
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
attributes uh that are are necessary for
 
01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.169 align:start position:0%
attributes uh that are are necessary for
reliability

01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
reliability
 
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
um the resources that that are best able
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
to serve those are
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
um something that that each state still
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
has to procure so uh each state has has
 
01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
had exposure to the uh volatility that
 
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
we've we've seen recently
 
01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh quick question
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
for you now this is about reliability
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
um myself being from Texas known hugots
 
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
National Gas field is one of the largest
 
01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
natural gas fields in the U.S and with
 
01:24:58.370 --> 01:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
plentiful gas in Pennsylvania but the
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
tech the gas can get here from Texas
 
01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
because the Jones act from what I
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
understand and Pennsylvania it's blocked
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
because of New York and Massachusetts
 
01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
not allowing pipelines across their
 
01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
states are we completely Reliant as of
 
01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
right now from getting our LNG from West
 
01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:13.070 align:start position:0%
right now from getting our LNG from West
Indies

01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
Indies
 
01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
all right uh yes yeah there have been uh
 
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
severe uh citing challenges and trying
 
01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
um natural gas pipeline capacity to New
 
01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.790 align:start position:0%
um natural gas pipeline capacity to New
England

01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
England
 
01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
um that's that's been continued that's
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
likely to continue
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
um there there is certainly not enough
 
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh infrastructure to make sure we have
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
the natural gas to meet the demands of a
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
system that is pretty reliant on natural
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
gas the Jones act does uh present a
 
01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.630 align:start position:0%
gas the Jones act does uh present a
hurdle

01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
hurdle
 
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
um you know there are no Jones act
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
compliant vessels that would allow us to
 
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
get American liquefied natural gas
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
um so our current right now I think it's
 
01:25:58.729 --> 01:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
uh Trinidad and Tobago uh is is where we
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
get our natural gas but it has been a
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
commissioner and Deputy Commissioner for
 
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
um my question is about I'm listening to
 
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
you talk about these limitations but
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
um I can recall a time when we were
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
managing a portfolio pie that showed us
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
the various places that our energy was
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
divided up into and we had plans around
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
each of those sectors of the energy
 
01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:35.659 align:start position:0%
economy if you will in order to lower
 
01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:40.580 align:start position:0%
demand over time and so my question is
 
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
rather than being reactive does the
 
01:26:45.770 --> 01:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
department have any positions around how
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
to be proactive in order to lower Peak
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
there we do have options for doing those
 
01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
things and it doesn't have to be a
 
01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
political position it could be more
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
economic keeping the dollars the energy
 
01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
dollars in the state basically
 
01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
um to allow people to do more with local
 
01:27:03.179 --> 01:27:04.669 align:start position:0%
um to allow people to do more with local
energy

01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:27:04.679 --> 01:27:05.810 align:start position:0%
energy
sure

01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure you've seen in our tenure
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
State energy strategy
 
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
um it's technology neutral right we
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
believe that's important
 
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
um that state government doesn't favor
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
any one source of energy over another
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and that there are
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
a few barriers to that type of
 
01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:25.850 align:start position:0%
a few barriers to that type of
development

01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:26.750 align:start position:0%
development
um

01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:30.060 align:start position:0%
you know we have an RPS which I'm sure
 
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
you're aware of and um you know I think
 
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
you know from a policy standpoint uh if
 
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
you look at the 10-year State energy
 
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
strategy we focused on
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
technology being technology neutral
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
um cost effective energy sources
 
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
um one other challenge would be uh even
 
01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
if we want to build
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
other types of generating Assets in New
 
01:27:59.209 --> 01:27:59.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether that be solar wind the
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
expansion of a of a gas pipeline those
 
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
are challenging in this environment and
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
even for us to pursue
 
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.770 align:start position:0%
even for us to pursue
um

01:28:09.770 --> 01:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
those types of energy resources to split
 
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
that pie up more right or give us a more
 
01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
diverse uh portfolio of energy resources
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
that would require
 
01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:21.430 align:start position:0%
that would require
um

01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
some streamlining of our citing process
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
um as a big part of that so
 
01:28:31.370 --> 01:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
again I think if we can address some of
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
those issues that could help
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
um with development of those those
 
01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:38.219 align:start position:0%
resources Mr chair me a follow-up
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
follow-up I I feel I feel like when you
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
were answering the commissioner that it
 
01:28:46.129 --> 01:28:46.139 align:start position:0%
was sort of a chicken egg thing right
 
01:28:48.169 --> 01:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
because there are aspects to the
 
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
operation that could be streamlined but
 
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
then there's also defining where you're
 
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
going to help figure out what the
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
streamlines are so I just would put that
 
01:28:57.770 --> 01:28:57.780 align:start position:0%
out there is that my concern is that the
 
01:28:57.780 --> 01:28:58.870 align:start position:0%
out there is that my concern is that the
doe

01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
doe
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
not just identify items in the plan that
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
are our goals but also to maybe be a
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
little more ambitious about saying what
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
are we doing so that businesses and
 
01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
everyone else can understand what the
 
01:29:13.729 --> 01:29:13.739 align:start position:0%
state is pursuing representative I would
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
remind you and the other members of the
 
01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
committee that were here to ask
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
questions to gather information and not
 
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
to debate or express our opinions yes
 
01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm not trying to debate I I
 
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
think I just was trying to make the
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
point that the presentation that you
 
01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
gave us seems more reactive than
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
proactive and I just want to okay you
 
01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
made your point thank you
 
01:29:39.169 --> 01:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
representative closure has a question
 
01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chairman commissioner
 
01:29:44.450 --> 01:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
in one of your slides you had mentioned
 
01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:46.100 align:start position:0%
that amount of
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
production was taken offline to meet the
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
carbon reduction that we needed to do my
 
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:29:58.010 --> 01:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
the production that was taken offline
 
01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
was it reliable and would it still be
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
online available if we did not have to
 
01:30:08.890 --> 01:30:08.900 align:start position:0%
make the CO2 carbon reduction thank you
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you that's a very good
 
01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.169 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you that's a very good
question

01:30:12.169 --> 01:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
um so to clarify the the 7000 or so
 
01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
megawatts that have gone offline or will
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
soon retire over the last 10 years
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
um that is in in most part been related
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
to economics the plants that are just no
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
longer economical uh in the market
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
um though those generation sources have
 
01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
mostly been coal oil and nuclear
 
01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:35.030 align:start position:0%
mostly been coal oil and nuclear
Generation

01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
Generation
 
01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
Um you know uh so they they are do tend
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
to have a higher reliability Factor
 
01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:41.510 align:start position:0%
to have a higher reliability Factor
um

01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
but but a lot of what's come offline has
 
01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
been sort uh Gone offline because the
 
01:30:51.050 --> 01:30:51.060 align:start position:0%
price of natural gas generation has
 
01:30:54.910 --> 01:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
um made those resources less economical
 
01:30:58.129 --> 01:30:58.139 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
01:30:59.930 --> 01:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
um you didn't mention nuclear is there
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
any chance that we can bring that
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
reliable energy
 
01:31:11.209 --> 01:31:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
so um with with deregulation right and
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
restructuring of of the market
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
um you know generating assets like
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
nuclear would either need to be a
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
merchant project or or the state would
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
um essentially do a procurement to
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
incent that type of development here
 
01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:32.510 align:start position:0%
incent that type of development here
um

01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know I I would probably leave it
 
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
there we have Seabrook nuclear uh
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
station which is 1200 megawatts of
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
generating capacity
 
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.110 align:start position:0%
generating capacity
um

01:31:42.110 --> 01:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh it would like every other
 
01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.149 align:start position:0%
uh it would like every other
um

01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
generating asset uh you would need uh
 
01:31:51.649 --> 01:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
there would also be issues around citing
 
01:31:53.570 --> 01:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
something like that so the same
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
challenge that applies to other types of
 
01:31:58.250 --> 01:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
generation would apply to nuclear as
 
01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:00.649 align:start position:0%
generation would apply to nuclear as
well

01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative Douglas
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I um
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
I let me make a statement first uh to my
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
question but getting back to the nuclear
 
01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.090 align:start position:0%
question but getting back to the nuclear
issue

01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
um I believe that there is a commission
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
that we're going through right now uh
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
and I think the term nuclear uh
 
01:32:29.330 --> 01:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
in what what we're thinking of in the
 
01:32:33.169 --> 01:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
future is far far smaller and safer so
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
as the public not to get the idea that
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
the question was involving large
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
buildings of nuclear such as Seabrook
 
01:32:42.169 --> 01:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
and so forth but getting back to my to
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:32:43.679 --> 01:32:46.189 align:start position:0%
my question
um

01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
I think New Hampshire has a lower
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
electricity rate than Massachusetts does
 
01:32:55.129 --> 01:32:55.139 align:start position:0%
for its electricity given the current uh
 
01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
rate request that just went in I think
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
by eversource in Massachusetts is New
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire basically
 
01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
um lower electrical rates and the rest
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
of New England or how does it compare to
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
the other New England states
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
so uh and this is something that I think
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
Tom Frantz will touch on sort of kind of
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
what goes into
 
01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
um you know the bill there are different
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill uh right now we saw
 
01:33:23.629 --> 01:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts rates for um their
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
various Electric utilities have exceeded
 
01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
what we've we currently have uh and and
 
01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
um you know there will be some
 
01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
reductions that go into effect soon for
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire repairs but Tom will
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
touch on a little bit of the differences
 
01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:38.750 align:start position:0%
touch on a little bit of the differences
between

01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
um you know the parts of the bill
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh I apologize for being ahead of myself
 
01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
here yeah
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh Commissioners uh for
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
being here and making that presentation
 
01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
to us uh I guess we can move on now to
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr Franz
 
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman Bose and members
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to be here this morning
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see
 
01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
some familiar faces and meet the new
 
01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
faces of the committee
 
01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
I'm Tom Frantz I'm the director of the
 
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
regulatory support group at the
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to at talk today about our
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory group who we are what we do
 
01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:44.330 align:start position:0%
regulatory group who we are what we do
uh

01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
commissioner chicoine gave a good
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
overview of that I'm going to dive a
 
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
little deeper but I'm still going to be
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
at a level that we're not going to go
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
real deep into the Weeds on regulatory
 
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
issues and and rate making uh but I do
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
want to discuss what we do
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
and and who
 
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
who are the key people that you may see
 
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
before you uh so I'm gonna first start
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
with the division regulatory
 
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
we're and I think I need to
 
01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:22.610 align:start position:0%
we're and I think I need to
images

01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
images
 
01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:24.050 align:start position:0%
images
okay

01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
I'll just press over yeah there we go
 
01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.850 align:start position:0%
I'll just press over yeah there we go
so

01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're division a small division
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
of Highly technical professionals with
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
very different backgrounds uh if you're
 
01:35:44.209 --> 01:35:44.219 align:start position:0%
smart inquisitive uh like to ask
 
01:35:44.219 --> 01:35:46.010 align:start position:0%
smart inquisitive uh like to ask
questions

01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
like to dig deep into the details
 
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
and have a background in engineering
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
economics business math accounting
 
01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:58.310 align:start position:0%
economics business math accounting
but

01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
we'd love to talk to you it's the kind
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
of division that we we look for those
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
type of people because they are
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
analysts and and have that kind of
 
01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
trust but verify mind
 
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
and so we have a sewer and water
 
01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:17.450 align:start position:0%
and so we have a sewer and water
division

01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
so these are all subdivisions of
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
regulatory and of course gas and of
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
course electricity
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
and with me today are uh the directors
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the electric group as well as the gas
 
01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
group Liz Nixon Dina riff
 
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:42.169 --> 01:36:42.179 align:start position:0%
so what do we do
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
we basically looked at all regulatory
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
filings that go before the Public
 
01:36:48.649 --> 01:36:48.659 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission if it has to do
 
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
with rates we're going to review it
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
analyze it and make recommendations at
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
the puc
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
and and we will also uh as part of that
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
ask a lot of questions and a lot of
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
dockets are opened at the puc as you
 
01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
well know if it has to do with rates it
 
01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
has to go to the puc for approval to
 
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
change rates which are part of a tariff
 
01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
so if a utility wants to change its
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
default service rate cost the gas rate
 
01:37:23.450 --> 01:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
distribution rate
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh the Energy Efficiency rates all those
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
go and are filed by the utilities at the
 
01:37:31.729 --> 01:37:31.739 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission we get
 
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
copies of those filings we are a group
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
that will take a deep look at those
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
filings and participate fully at the
 
01:37:41.209 --> 01:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission in those
 
01:37:41.219 --> 01:37:42.830 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission in those
proceedings

01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.209 align:start position:0%
proceedings
so

01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
lots of lots of proceedings as if you
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
looked at the public utilities
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
commission's website you'd see that over
 
01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
a course of a year there are hundreds of
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
open dockets
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
and probably 60 to 70 percent of them
 
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
are electric another 20 25
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
are probably gas and and then water and
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
and Sewer
 
01:38:11.689 --> 01:38:11.699 align:start position:0%
so mergers and Acquisitions lease cost
 
01:38:11.699 --> 01:38:13.250 align:start position:0%
so mergers and Acquisitions lease cost
plans

01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
plans
 
01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
and then of course uh rate cases which
 
01:38:20.330 --> 01:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
are massive dockets and we seem to have
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
one or two of those a year those are all
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
filings that we will participate in
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
fully and by fully also I mean that we
 
01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.050 align:start position:0%
fully and by fully also I mean that we
will

01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh ultimately for many of these
 
01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
proceedings and all the big proceedings
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
file testimony pre-filed testimony
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
and then testify
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
at at the hearing on on the issues
 
01:38:44.159 --> 01:38:45.770 align:start position:0%
at at the hearing on on the issues
so

01:38:45.770 --> 01:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
and Regulatory also supports
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
other divisions within the department of
 
01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:52.330 align:start position:0%
other divisions within the department of
energy

01:38:52.330 --> 01:38:52.340 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
as well as works with groups and state
 
01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:58.129 align:start position:0%
as well as works with groups and state
agencies

01:38:58.129 --> 01:38:58.139 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:39:00.169 --> 01:39:00.179 align:start position:0%
other state agencies
 
01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
so if you have questions as I go feel
 
01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
free to just jump in and ask them I'm
 
01:39:09.290 --> 01:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
happy to go
 
01:39:11.330 --> 01:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:12.290 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
question

01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair can't see
 
01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:16.860 align:start position:0%
you but um I'm over here
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
um I I just want a clarification on the
 
01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer are you at all concerned
 
01:39:24.970 --> 01:39:24.980 align:start position:0%
with biosolids or is this simply rates
 
01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:28.860 align:start position:0%
concerned with biosolids in water and
 
01:39:31.850 --> 01:39:31.860 align:start position:0%
and Sewer or is this just rates uh
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
mostly it's economic regulation yes the
 
01:39:37.689 --> 01:39:37.699 align:start position:0%
reg the environmental regulation
 
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
obviously affects the overall
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
determination of what is a used and
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
useful or prudently incurred uh rate
 
01:39:49.729 --> 01:39:49.739 align:start position:0%
that customers will pay so
 
01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:53.699 align:start position:0%
if if it's but we don't mandate we're
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
not the environmental Regulators we are
 
01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
first and foremost economic Regulators
 
01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh quick overview yes representative
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question how
 
01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:09.179 align:start position:0%
are you Mr France fine thank you good to
 
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
see you
 
01:40:12.770 --> 01:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
um so my question was whether your group
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're a group of subject
 
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
matter experts so you're providing uh
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
input to the public utilities
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and I was wondering if the
 
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
recent uh docket that was resolved on
 
01:40:27.050 --> 01:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
the value of distributed energy if that
 
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
was something that your office was
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
involved with creating economics on or
 
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
our group was involved with it but uh it
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
was actually led by someone you'll see a
 
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
little later Deandra okay so and you're
 
01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
going to talk about value Dr
 
01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:46.070 align:start position:0%
going to talk about value Dr
so

01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
well and and we can chat about it too
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
so uh back to a quick overview of the
 
01:40:58.430 --> 01:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
regulated Gas Utilities in New Hampshire
 
01:41:01.129 --> 01:41:01.139 align:start position:0%
for those who are weren't uh been here
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
before you know this but perhaps the new
 
01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
members don't we have two regulated Gas
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
Utilities in New Hampshire uh
 
01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
Energy North
 
01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
and and Northern northern's an affiliate
 
01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:16.860 align:start position:0%
subsidiary of Unitil and Energy North
 
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
with Liberty Utilities and you can see
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
their service distribution area is
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
basically the areas that are highly
 
01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
populated in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
the Merrimack Valley Corridor and then
 
01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
the Seacoast are the areas where gas is
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh where there's a pipeline has been
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
built out deliveries there so Energy
 
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
North is a larger gas utility in the
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
state it's about ninety six thousand
 
01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
total customers and northern's about one
 
01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
about one-third of that
 
01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:50.209 align:start position:0%
about one-third of that
so

01:41:50.209 --> 01:41:50.219 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:53.689 --> 01:41:53.699 align:start position:0%
uh still major industry
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
one thing I want to mention about gas is
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
that the utilities purchase long-term
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
contracts for gas and that has an effect
 
01:42:03.290 --> 01:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
on electric rates
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh as as some of you know
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
the priority for
 
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
gas first goes to those who are
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
contracted for it and then the energy
 
01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
generators that use
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
natural gas the combined cycle plants
 
01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:23.219 align:start position:0%
that make up a large group of of New
 
01:42:23.219 --> 01:42:24.410 align:start position:0%
that make up a large group of of New
England

01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
England
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
for the most part they buy off the spot
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
market so in fact gas is already
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
contracted for they don't have gas
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
available in the really cold days to
 
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
generate electricity so I just want to
 
01:42:38.930 --> 01:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
that's a high level overview of the gas
 
01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
that's a high level overview of the gas
electric

01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
electric
 
01:42:42.649 --> 01:42:42.659 align:start position:0%
interconnection in New England and it's
 
01:42:46.330 --> 01:42:46.340 align:start position:0%
an important one because those
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
contracts provide for heating and for
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
for the customers of the of the retail
 
01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
Gas Utilities
 
01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
but that makes less gas available than
 
01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.810 --> 01:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
and then a similar
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
slide for electricity
 
01:43:10.609 --> 01:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
we have four franchised electric
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
distribution companies
 
01:43:16.129 --> 01:43:16.139 align:start position:0%
the largest of course is eversource
 
01:43:17.930 --> 01:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
as we know Public Service of New
 
01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:19.010 align:start position:0%
as we know Public Service of New
Hampshire

01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
then of course Unitil Liberty and the
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
co-op which is minimally regulated uh in
 
01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
it's a member owned cooperative and it
 
01:43:33.649 --> 01:43:33.659 align:start position:0%
can change rates basically overnight
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
without coming to the Public Utilities
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
Commission depending on what kind of
 
01:43:38.689 --> 01:43:38.699 align:start position:0%
rate that is that it's changing but it
 
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to the puc for changes in
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
default service doesn't come to the to
 
01:43:45.169 --> 01:43:45.179 align:start position:0%
the puc for changes in distribution
 
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
rates it does have some regulation with
 
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh stranded costs and with Energy
 
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
Efficiency though
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
we have five municipal
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
Utilities in New Hampshire also and this
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
is a big business
 
01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
I kind of like to put these numbers in
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
there utility regulation touches
 
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state and it is a very
 
01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
significant economic business for New
 
01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:12.830 align:start position:0%
significant economic business for New
Hampshire

01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:44:17.689 --> 01:44:17.699 align:start position:0%
1.9 billion dollars of annual retail
 
01:44:17.699 --> 01:44:18.649 align:start position:0%
1.9 billion dollars of annual retail
sales

01:44:18.649 --> 01:44:18.659 align:start position:0%
sales
 
01:44:18.659 --> 01:44:20.149 align:start position:0%
sales
uh

01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of megawatt hours are sold
 
01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.410 align:start position:0%
a lot of megawatt hours are sold
and

01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
everybody's happy if the rates are low
 
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
and the lights always stay on and
 
01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
everyone gets upset quickly when the
 
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
rates go up and the lights go off so uh
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
and that is nothing new to anyone in
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
this room
 
01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
so how do we regulate
 
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
what do we do
 
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
what is the basis for it
 
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure others perhaps Mr crease
 
01:44:50.689 --> 01:44:50.699 align:start position:0%
will talk about the legal issues
 
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
associated with regulation
 
01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.090 align:start position:0%
associated with regulation
but

01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
at the heart and I'll just mention them
 
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
quickly uh
 
01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:03.950 align:start position:0%
quickly uh
utilities

01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.390 align:start position:0%
 
must

01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
must
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
and we look at this make that their
 
01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
Investments are prudently incurred and
 
01:45:12.649 --> 01:45:12.659 align:start position:0%
that they are used and useful those are
 
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
really nice words that come from the
 
01:45:18.169 --> 01:45:18.179 align:start position:0%
courts but uh we take them seriously and
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
we look at all the costs when they come
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
in and ask for a rate increase we look
 
01:45:24.649 --> 01:45:24.659 align:start position:0%
at their Capital costs we look at their
 
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
expenses we look at what they're
 
01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
spending it on if it could have been
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
lower and so all that gets thrown
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
together in what we call determining the
 
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
revenue requirement and the revenue
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
requirement is a very simple formula
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
with a lot of details and about a foot
 
01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:43.370 align:start position:0%
with a lot of details and about a foot
of

01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
information that goes behind it
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
so the Reverend um yes
 
01:45:51.169 --> 01:45:51.179 align:start position:0%
I keep forgetting so the revenue
 
01:45:53.209 --> 01:45:53.219 align:start position:0%
requirement basically we look at the O M
 
01:45:53.219 --> 01:45:54.590 align:start position:0%
requirement basically we look at the O M
costs

01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
and then depreciation amortization
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
depreciation of poles wires conductor
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
and then of course taxes are thrown in
 
01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:05.689 align:start position:0%
and then of course taxes are thrown in
there

01:46:05.689 --> 01:46:05.699 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:08.580 align:start position:0%
and then one of the highly controversial
 
01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:10.980 align:start position:0%
aspects of any Revenue requirement in
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
the rate case is the return on
 
01:46:13.199 --> 01:46:14.390 align:start position:0%
the rate case is the return on
investment

01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
and the returns basically the overall
 
01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
cost of capital which is a combination
 
01:46:22.129 --> 01:46:22.139 align:start position:0%
of the cost of debt short term and long
 
01:46:22.139 --> 01:46:22.850 align:start position:0%
of the cost of debt short term and long
term

01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh that's pretty straightforward they
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
have to file
 
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
at the puc
 
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
for an approval of a financing for for
 
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
debt issuance so that's well known uh
 
01:46:37.729 --> 01:46:37.739 align:start position:0%
but also then the return on Equity what
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
should investors get for their return on
 
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
on this company's
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
operations and profit and that is always
 
01:46:49.609 --> 01:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
controversial so
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
we've in New Hampshire always we have
 
01:46:54.169 --> 01:46:54.179 align:start position:0%
always been
 
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
in the lower end of that return on
 
01:46:58.129 --> 01:46:58.139 align:start position:0%
Equity range although most people think
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's still way too high if you ask
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
someone uh but it's not just pulled out
 
01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
of the air there's a lot of economic
 
01:47:07.609 --> 01:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
theory that goes into determining the
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
return on equity and we uh
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot of decisions to make on that
 
01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:18.260 align:start position:0%
and I won't get into the details but
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
we've approved return on equities over
 
01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:47:25.609 --> 01:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
literally 20 years that have been lower
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:31.189 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
and currently are in the low high eighth
 
01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
very high eighths to load to uh middle
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
nine percent return on equities
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
now I want to mention something that I
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
hear a lot and I want to correct it
 
01:47:48.169 --> 01:47:48.179 align:start position:0%
that's not a guaranteed return
 
01:47:50.689 --> 01:47:50.699 align:start position:0%
it's a return that is reasonable at the
 
01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
time based on the economic conditions in
 
01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
the markets and that they have the
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to re to actually earn that
 
01:48:01.250 --> 01:48:01.260 align:start position:0%
return but it's by no means guaranteed
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative Doug Thomas has a
 
01:48:15.530 --> 01:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
question for you yes representative yeah
 
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr friends thank you for
 
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
coming back here I always enjoyed your
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
presentations and thank you testimonies
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
um so I'm a little bit confused now uh
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
when you say that the return on
 
01:48:28.930 --> 01:48:28.940 align:start position:0%
investment is not guaranteed
 
01:48:33.169 --> 01:48:33.179 align:start position:0%
and the utilities are regulated so could
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
you just go and maybe dive with just a
 
01:48:38.450 --> 01:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
little bit deeper into what you mean by
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
that and but isn't there some isn't
 
01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
there some rate of return that they
 
01:48:45.609 --> 01:48:45.619 align:start position:0%
expect to get because being regulated
 
01:48:48.649 --> 01:48:48.659 align:start position:0%
that's why some people invest in these
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
companies because they can they can
 
01:48:53.810 --> 01:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
almost get a certain an expectation of a
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
certain rate of return uh you use the
 
01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
key word there representative Thomas
 
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
expectation yeah expectation versus
 
01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:01.430 align:start position:0%
expectation yeah expectation versus
guarantee

01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
guarantee
 
01:49:04.490 --> 01:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
and and that's the key so at the time
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
the utility makes the filing
 
01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
they'll have a certain level of Revenue
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
they'll look at what their costs are uh
 
01:49:14.450 --> 01:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
all the aspects I had in that Revenue
 
01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
requirement formula and then they'll
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
file that and say this is what we should
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
get we're at 100 right now we think that
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
we need a 10 increase that's 110 for our
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue requirement and it's based on
 
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
all these all these costs the capital
 
01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
and then the depreciation rates but the
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
return we expect should be let's say 10
 
01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.070 align:start position:0%
return we expect should be let's say 10
percent

01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:41.209 align:start position:0%
percent
and

01:49:41.209 --> 01:49:41.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
we'll look at it and we might fight over
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
it and argue about it and finally settle
 
01:49:47.209 --> 01:49:47.219 align:start position:0%
on some number but once we settle on
 
01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
that number in the revenue requirement
 
01:49:51.169 --> 01:49:51.179 align:start position:0%
things change
 
01:49:53.450 --> 01:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
you know at that time that's a
 
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of what they
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
should earn
 
01:49:58.129 --> 01:49:58.139 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
01:50:00.770 --> 01:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
certainly transmitted to the markets to
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
Wall Street to investment firms everyone
 
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
covers those things but
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
conditions change
 
01:50:12.649 --> 01:50:12.659 align:start position:0%
they may not be in for a new rate case
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
and change the return on equity for
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
another two three four five years and so
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
they may
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
have costs that go up
 
01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
they may see market conditions that for
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
sales that decrease or they could go the
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
other way and they could have higher
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
returns we still monitor that we have
 
01:50:36.050 --> 01:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
them file with us we look at it on a
 
01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis so we want to make sure
 
01:50:40.970 --> 01:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
that it's reasonable that it stays
 
01:50:42.890 --> 01:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
within that that
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable Bend because we know it's
 
01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
going to fluctuate weather will make it
 
01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
fluctuate uh economic conditions a
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
recession could make it fluctuate all
 
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
kinds of things can change that actual
 
01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
return versus the expectation of that
 
01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:56.450 align:start position:0%
return versus the expectation of that
return

01:50:56.450 --> 01:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:51:01.010 --> 01:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
and and if it gets too low uh
 
01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
they may come in earlier than we
 
01:51:07.209 --> 01:51:07.219 align:start position:0%
anticipate and if it gets maybe too high
 
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
some phone calls are made and said we're
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
looking at this return and we may call
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
you in to lower your rates because your
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
return is too high based on what it was
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
approved or the market conditions that
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
existed at the time
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
does that help yes follow up thank you
 
01:51:29.810 --> 01:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:31.490 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:51:31.490 --> 01:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
on a private a firm that's not being
 
01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
in an industry that's not being
 
01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
regulated uh their rate of return could
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
be much higher depending on how well
 
01:51:43.970 --> 01:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
they do and the economy in this type of
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
Industry then
 
01:51:48.649 --> 01:51:48.659 align:start position:0%
um there's probably a certain range that
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to go above like
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't expect them to get 15 20
 
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
rate of return uh just because they're
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
regulated and because of how they affect
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
the public and the rates and so forth so
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
isn't there something I'm here I know
 
01:52:03.590 --> 01:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
isn't there something today expectation
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a just a narrow range that
 
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
they can go up up and down excellent uh
 
01:52:10.430 --> 01:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
there's an incredible amount of
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
arguments and fighting and discussion
 
01:52:17.090 --> 01:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
about what that range should be but in
 
01:52:20.330 --> 01:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
general for a regulated utilities
 
01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
the range for the return on equity
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
currently is between about
 
01:52:30.490 --> 01:52:30.500 align:start position:0%
8.4 percent and probably 9.6 percent
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:37.850 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.350 align:start position:0%
representative
Summers

01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
Summers
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a quick question
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
for you on the the graph that you had
 
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
and thank you for providing this
 
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
um with my constituents seeing their
 
01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
electrical rates go from Seven cents per
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
kilowatt back in last March to now where
 
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
it's over 25 26 Cents more than tripling
 
01:52:58.370 --> 01:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
over the last year
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
um is this 100 caused by the default
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
energy cost ah
 
01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
yes I mean we've had some other changes
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
but by far the key driver of the large
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
increase in electric bills
 
01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
is is the change in default Energy
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
service and I'm going to spend some time
 
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
on on why that is and how how it's
 
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:25.609 --> 01:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and Deputy Commissioner
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned they talked about the
 
01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
wholesale markets they talked about gas
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
prices LNG those are all the obviously
 
01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
Ukraine Russia War those are all
 
01:53:38.689 --> 01:53:38.699 align:start position:0%
affecting these wholesale markets and
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
the wholesale markets then affect the
 
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
retail markets so I'm actually going to
 
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
get get into that but when you look at
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
this chart and you see how large that
 
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
one part of the pie is for default
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
Energy service and that this is a
 
01:53:54.649 --> 01:53:54.659 align:start position:0%
typical 625 kilowatt hour eversource
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
customer residential paying now 141
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
dollars just for that energy not not for
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
the delivery of it not for the
 
01:54:06.169 --> 01:54:06.179 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution the
 
01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
delivery part of it not the trading
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
costs some other things have gone up by
 
01:54:14.330 --> 01:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
50 cents or a dollar or two dollars you
 
01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
know but this this piece actually
 
01:54:20.689 --> 01:54:20.699 align:start position:0%
uh depending on how far back you go a
 
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
year ago it was it was in in the eight
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
to ten Cent range a year and a half to
 
01:54:28.850 --> 01:54:28.860 align:start position:0%
two years ago and the bill itself was
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
about a hundred and
 
01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
ten to twenty dollars two years ago
 
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
and almost all of that's driven for the
 
01:54:40.850 --> 01:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
most part by the massive increase in
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
default service
 
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
um earlier the commissioner made a point
 
01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:51.470 align:start position:0%
um earlier the commissioner made a point
of

01:54:51.470 --> 01:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
saying that New Hampshire among all New
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
England states was the most Market
 
01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:58.010 align:start position:0%
England states was the most Market
oriented

01:54:58.010 --> 01:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
oriented
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
our system our rules the most Market
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
oriented would you say that
 
01:55:06.850 --> 01:55:06.860 align:start position:0%
looking at the graph and that recent
 
01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
explosion of of retail rates is that
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
translate to making New Hampshire's
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
customers the most vulnerable to Market
 
01:55:19.129 --> 01:55:19.139 align:start position:0%
fluctuations and the price
 
01:55:22.609 --> 01:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
of the energy that supports our system
 
01:55:22.619 --> 01:55:24.649 align:start position:0%
of the energy that supports our system
so

01:55:24.649 --> 01:55:24.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:24.659 --> 01:55:28.189 align:start position:0%
so
customers

01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.729 --> 01:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
are affected by these wholesale markets
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
and and so let me take you back if I may
 
01:55:38.450 --> 01:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
for just quickly to talk about what it
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
was like before we restructured the
 
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
electricity markets
 
01:55:45.290 --> 01:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
because that's important to this
 
01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:46.669 align:start position:0%
because that's important to this
question

01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:55:50.689 --> 01:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
um I'll do it very quickly so
 
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
for most of the history of regulation of
 
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
of utilities and electricity
 
01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
it was what we called vertical
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
integration the generation the
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
transmission the distribution we're all
 
01:56:04.129 --> 01:56:04.139 align:start position:0%
owned by one company
 
01:56:04.139 --> 01:56:04.910 align:start position:0%
owned by one company
um

01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:07.250 --> 01:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
the transmission was regulated by the
 
01:56:08.930 --> 01:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as
 
01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
it still is
 
01:56:12.590 --> 01:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
but distribution and generation were
 
01:56:15.410 --> 01:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
regulated by the state commissions
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
and the utilities either purchase power
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
through long-term contracts with
 
01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
companies that own generation
 
01:56:25.370 --> 01:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
at at prices that were then
 
01:56:27.770 --> 01:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh approved by commissions
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
and and or they owned the actual
 
01:56:31.679 --> 01:56:33.290 align:start position:0%
and and or they owned the actual
Hardware

01:56:33.290 --> 01:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
Hardware
 
01:56:36.410 --> 01:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
the actual generating plants and a great
 
01:56:37.609 --> 01:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
example of that of course in New
 
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was Public Service Company in
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire owned a lot of the
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
generating plants in the state
 
01:56:46.330 --> 01:56:46.340 align:start position:0%

01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
owned a large piece of Seabrook
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh Newington Chiller and we essentially
 
01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
set the rates for generation
 
01:57:00.290 --> 01:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
as restructuring came about and the idea
 
01:57:03.290 --> 01:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
was that these are there's no Monopoly
 
01:57:06.169 --> 01:57:06.179 align:start position:0%
in generation other companies can run
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
these plants they can do it perhaps
 
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
better cheaper more efficient and more
 
01:57:15.070 --> 01:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
importantly the risk would be on those
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
generators those owners
 
01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
now that sounds simple and it sounded
 
01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:23.820 align:start position:0%
pretty good and New Hampshire was one of
 
01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
the first states to actually move to
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
deregulate the generating plants uh and
 
01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
make them competitive and we divested
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
for the most part A lot of it back in
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
the late 90s and early 2000s
 
01:57:39.119 --> 01:57:40.370 align:start position:0%
the late 90s and early 2000s
but

01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
there was some stability to owning
 
01:57:43.970 --> 01:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
generation there's no question about
 
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
that those plants were not those prices
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
weren't set by the market they were
 
01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
regulated based on a cost of service
 
01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:53.149 align:start position:0%
regulated based on a cost of service
model

01:57:53.149 --> 01:57:53.159 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:57:56.450 --> 01:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
and there was stability to that the
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
problem was
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
they were also perhaps not as well run
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps as a market would be not quite
 
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
as efficient
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
and was very much out of step with most
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
of New England that had divested all its
 
01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:12.950 align:start position:0%
of New England that had divested all its
generation

01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
generation
 
01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
and so over time we'd finally finished
 
01:58:19.070 --> 01:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
the visitor of New Hampshire's
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
generating Assets in 2017 early 18 with
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
the sale of the remaining fossil hydro
 
01:58:28.430 --> 01:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
plants that PSNH owned
 
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
and if you
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
this will be illustrated by the
 
01:58:39.169 --> 01:58:39.179 align:start position:0%
differences so when the wholesale market
 
01:58:42.890 --> 01:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
prices in New England were low as they
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
were for much of uh
 
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
the 2000
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
sixth well actually even before this
 
01:58:54.169 --> 01:58:54.179 align:start position:0%
slide going back to 2000 five six seven
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
with low gas prices and then
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
then there was a polar vortex where you
 
01:59:02.209 --> 01:59:02.219 align:start position:0%
see the big increase in around January
 
01:59:02.219 --> 01:59:03.589 align:start position:0%
see the big increase in around January
of

01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:59:06.530 --> 01:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
2015 that's the wholesale markets
 
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
reacting to cold weather and difficult
 
01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
getting gas
 
01:59:13.010 --> 01:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
and they reflect it quickly in the
 
01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
market a very efficient market and it
 
01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:17.510 align:start position:0%
market a very efficient market and it
indicates

01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
indicates
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
how that market Moves In step with
 
01:59:22.250 --> 01:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
weather and and
 
01:59:25.070 --> 01:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas and LNG prices
 
01:59:28.250 --> 01:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
but the yellow line pretty much goes you
 
01:59:28.260 --> 01:59:29.149 align:start position:0%
but the yellow line pretty much goes you
know

01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:59:31.250 --> 01:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
straight across and that was ever
 
01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:32.629 align:start position:0%
straight across and that was ever
sources

01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:59:35.209 --> 01:59:35.219 align:start position:0%
cost of default service because almost
 
01:59:37.490 --> 01:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
all of that was based on their
 
01:59:39.290 --> 01:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
generating assets they did purchase from
 
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
the market but that was mostly their
 
01:59:43.490 --> 01:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
generating assets and for quite a while
 
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
it looked like it would stay much higher
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
than actually the purchases for the
 
01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.430 align:start position:0%
than actually the purchases for the
market

01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
so you see the yellow line above
 
01:59:54.169 --> 01:59:54.179 align:start position:0%
the problem with that was because more
 
01:59:55.729 --> 01:59:55.739 align:start position:0%
and more customers would leave default
 
01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
service for eversource and go to what we
 
01:59:59.810 --> 01:59:59.820 align:start position:0%
call third-party competitive energy
 
01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:01.129 align:start position:0%
call third-party competitive energy
suppliers

02:00:01.129 --> 02:00:01.139 align:start position:0%
suppliers
 
02:00:04.010 --> 02:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
and that's the retail aspect they don't
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
have to stay with the default service
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
customer we have
 
02:00:10.129 --> 02:00:10.139 align:start position:0%
companies out there that will sell and
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have to stay with your default
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
service utility
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
that just makes it even more difficult
 
02:00:19.970 --> 02:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
to recover those costs from fewer and
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
fewer customers
 
02:00:23.689 --> 02:00:23.699 align:start position:0%
so we divested it was this it was a
 
02:00:25.729 --> 02:00:25.739 align:start position:0%
state decision I was part of the
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
divestiture team there's other people
 
02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
here that I've seen that are also key
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
members of the divestiture team and the
 
02:00:36.530 --> 02:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
fossil hydros assets for PSNH were sold
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
and after they were sold
 
02:00:40.729 --> 02:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
eversource then became like Unitil and
 
02:00:43.209 --> 02:00:43.219 align:start position:0%
like Liberty and really like the co-op
 
02:00:46.089 --> 02:00:46.099 align:start position:0%
they solicit power
 
02:00:50.330 --> 02:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh entrances every six months and so
 
02:00:51.470 --> 02:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
they go out to the wholesale Market
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
their wholesale Market participants who
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
bid on it and they take the risk of the
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
sales they take the risk of the quantity
 
02:00:59.870 --> 02:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
they take the weather risk the fuel risk
 
02:01:01.550 --> 02:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes most of the time
 
02:01:05.639 --> 02:01:07.250 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes most of the time
it's

02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:01:08.930 --> 02:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
less than what it would have been if
 
02:01:11.530 --> 02:01:11.540 align:start position:0%
PSNH eversource had kept those assets
 
02:01:14.450 --> 02:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
today's probably not one of those times
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
but the risk belongs with those
 
02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
suppliers with the folks that that bid
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
on default service and that's probably
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
where it belongs and and I think it's a
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
model that overall works I think we see
 
02:01:31.010 --> 02:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
the efficiency as far as markets because
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
when when input prices change the their
 
02:01:37.609 --> 02:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
prices change so customers certainly see
 
02:01:43.609 --> 02:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.649 --> 02:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
and right now it's high as you can see
 
02:01:47.450 --> 02:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
it's not as high as it is in
 
02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or potentially in
 
02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
Connecticut but these are markets across
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
all New England and so uh we're not
 
02:01:57.649 --> 02:01:57.659 align:start position:0%
immune we share a lot of the same pain
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
and we share a lot of the same benefit
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
it also depends on when you go out to
 
02:02:04.189 --> 02:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
get default service and by the way the
 
02:02:06.169 --> 02:02:06.179 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission has a docket
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
open on procuring default service and
 
02:02:11.089 --> 02:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
and whether it should be changed in one
 
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
way or another and we're actually
 
02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
looking at it too uh our group and
 
02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
Regulatory had a really nice
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
presentation from a consulting firm
 
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
about descending clock auctions instead
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
of sealed bids and things like that but
 
02:02:27.169 --> 02:02:27.179 align:start position:0%
but so we're always trying to see is
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
there a better way to get it uh just a
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:32.510 align:start position:0%
little bit
cheaper

02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
cheaper
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question for
 
02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:35.689 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question for
you

02:02:35.689 --> 02:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:02:37.490 --> 02:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:38.689 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
friends

02:02:38.689 --> 02:02:38.699 align:start position:0%
friends
 
02:02:38.699 --> 02:02:40.129 align:start position:0%
friends
um

02:02:40.129 --> 02:02:40.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
you talk about the risk being
 
02:02:45.649 --> 02:02:45.659 align:start position:0%
transferred to the um
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
the distribution companies the ever
 
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
sources of the world yeah but is there
 
02:02:51.709 --> 02:02:51.719 align:start position:0%
the risk for default service that energy
 
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
piece right being transferred to a third
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
party bidder for default service but is
 
02:02:58.250 --> 02:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
it really transferred to them because
 
02:03:00.830 --> 02:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
don't the rate payers ultimately absorb
 
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
the cost well they absorbed the price
 
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
that's actually uh been approved by the
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
commission and and that was submitted by
 
02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
the bidder and so there are bidders out
 
02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:14.820 align:start position:0%
there that get a nice little packet from
 
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
all the utilities every six months that
 
02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
says we are looking for uh
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
six months of power
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
and you take you essentially take the
 
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
those risks and then they
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
they bid on that and say well I'll
 
02:03:35.390 --> 02:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
gas prices based on my weather
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
forecasting folks back in Houston and
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and I'll bid you know 22
 
02:03:46.729 --> 02:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
cents right now for the next six months
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
power now they may make
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
some real money on on that six months at
 
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
22 cents if they are well hedged and
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
prices go down or something like that
 
02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
but if a large customer leaves or a
 
02:04:02.689 --> 02:04:02.699 align:start position:0%
number of customers leave or if the
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
weather is really bad and their prices
 
02:04:07.370 --> 02:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
go high that price doesn't change for
 
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
the customers that default service price
 
02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
is locked in it's fixed and and it and
 
02:04:15.169 --> 02:04:15.179 align:start position:0%
it goes forward so
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
I guess it it's a little bit like you
 
02:04:19.370 --> 02:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
know what do you mean by the risk well
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
they the the wholesale supplier takes
 
02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
two types of
 
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
risk when they bid and and are selected
 
02:04:28.430 --> 02:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
they take a quantity risk that they
 
02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
expect let's say the
 
02:04:33.649 --> 02:04:33.659 align:start position:0%
it's about three million megawatt hours
 
02:04:35.629 --> 02:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
for the first six months that of
 
02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
eversource so they're going to supply
 
02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
all the power that's needed
 
02:04:42.770 --> 02:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
and if that power is a lot higher and
 
02:04:45.169 --> 02:04:45.179 align:start position:0%
and it goes up 10 because a really cold
 
02:04:45.179 --> 02:04:46.550 align:start position:0%
and it goes up 10 because a really cold
winter

02:04:46.550 --> 02:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
winter
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to sell more
 
02:04:50.209 --> 02:04:50.219 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours but they're going to have
 
02:04:52.010 --> 02:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
to find those megawatt hours and they're
 
02:04:54.530 --> 02:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
going to have to still Supply it at the
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
price it's been approved
 
02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
or if a large customer leaves now
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to uh or if a lot
 
02:05:06.050 --> 02:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
of uh the weather is really warm they
 
02:05:08.209 --> 02:05:08.219 align:start position:0%
may have Excess power that they now
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
won't be able to sell in default service
 
02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
that they'll have to find a customer for
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
or a number of customers in the market
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
then then sell that Excess power
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
which may be at a lower price than they
 
02:05:21.410 --> 02:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
had expected from the default service so
 
02:05:23.689 --> 02:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
when I say risk they're taking a
 
02:05:25.609 --> 02:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
quantity and a price risk for that
 
02:05:30.250 --> 02:05:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
thank you continue on please I I will
 
02:05:36.050 --> 02:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
I'll try to speed this up so as I
 
02:05:37.490 --> 02:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned you don't have to stay with
 
02:05:39.290 --> 02:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
your default service supplier you don't
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
have to stay with ever source and get
 
02:05:43.490 --> 02:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
the power for those prices that are
 
02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:45.719 align:start position:0%
approved by the puc
 
02:05:45.719 --> 02:05:46.490 align:start position:0%
approved by the puc
um

02:05:46.490 --> 02:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
you can go to a competitive energy
 
02:05:48.719 --> 02:05:49.910 align:start position:0%
you can go to a competitive energy
Supply

02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
Supply
 
02:05:51.950 --> 02:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
supplier and we have a number of them
 
02:05:54.290 --> 02:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
that are registered uh in New Hampshire
 
02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
and you can go to the website there and
 
02:05:58.810 --> 02:05:58.820 align:start position:0%
check out prices and a lot of people do
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
the large commercial industrial
 
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
customers moved away from default
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
service to competitive suppliers early
 
02:06:07.550 --> 02:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
on and have stayed there there's there's
 
02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:10.739 align:start position:0%
you can see that in this
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
especially in the next slide
 
02:06:15.890 --> 02:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
where you can see that for the cni class
 
02:06:19.010 --> 02:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
for eversource 87 percent are with a
 
02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier
 
02:06:22.729 --> 02:06:22.739 align:start position:0%
but only 17 percent of residential
 
02:06:22.739 --> 02:06:24.410 align:start position:0%
but only 17 percent of residential
customers

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
customers
 
02:06:28.129 --> 02:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
the nurse is a tough thing so but with
 
02:06:30.410 --> 02:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
these higher prices I think we're seeing
 
02:06:33.530 --> 02:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
that it's increased somewhat there were
 
02:06:35.810 --> 02:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
uh there was a lot of discussion just
 
02:06:38.570 --> 02:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
even three four months ago that you
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
could get a 14 15
 
02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:43.739 align:start position:0%
maybe 16 Cent rate which is certainly
 
02:06:45.770 --> 02:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
lower than the default service rate and
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
so customers you know to the extent we
 
02:06:51.290 --> 02:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
let them know that and and others do
 
02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.290 --> 02:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
02:06:59.149 --> 02:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
for you thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Tom just right on
 
02:07:03.410 --> 02:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
that subject I've run into it personally
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
trying to educate people on this and I'm
 
02:07:07.070 --> 02:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
wondering if the department has any type
 
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
of an outreach program you try to tell
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
people go to a competitive supplier and
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
I was trying to tell people when they
 
02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
were getting 12 cents and every Source
 
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
was 23 cents and there's this built in
 
02:07:22.970 --> 02:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
fear that somehow they're going to if
 
02:07:24.770 --> 02:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
they lose electricity no one will come
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
and fix the wires uh that they they
 
02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
won't they'll have to get multiple bills
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
and there'll be no one to call if they
 
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
have a problem and how do we get over
 
02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
that is is a department have some type
 
02:07:38.570 --> 02:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
of a like web page or some kind of
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
Outreach to people so that they can uh
 
02:07:43.550 --> 02:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
be more uh you know be assured that
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's they think they're taking this
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
big risk and there's no risk at all no
 
02:07:48.770 --> 02:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
you're right and and the men in newnan's
 
02:07:50.570 --> 02:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
worked on this for years and years and
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
years and has done a great job of trying
 
02:07:55.010 --> 02:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
to educate customers and and get over
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
the get them over the hump this fear of
 
02:08:01.550 --> 02:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
that if I switch from my default Service
 
02:08:02.930 --> 02:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
Company they're not going to come fix
 
02:08:05.209 --> 02:08:05.219 align:start position:0%
the wires we can always probably do more
 
02:08:08.149 --> 02:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
there's a whole list of discussions
 
02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
about that and and you can click on that
 
02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
and and there's questions and answers
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:36.890 --> 02:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
helps reassure them for some of their
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
questions Ms Noonan we can't really hear
 
02:08:41.570 --> 02:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
you so I'm going to ask you to come up
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:49.089 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:08:49.089 --> 02:08:49.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
I could speak loudly enough for you all
 
02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
to hear me
 
02:08:55.609 --> 02:08:55.619 align:start position:0%
um what I just wanted to say is you all
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
feel please feel free to direct any
 
02:08:59.930 --> 02:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
constituent calls to the Department of
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
energy My Team Works closely with
 
02:09:04.729 --> 02:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
customers regularly I can hear them on
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
the phone walking people through the web
 
02:09:10.250 --> 02:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
pages the prices what to look for what
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
to consider before they make a choice of
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
an energy supplier reassuring them to
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's point that
 
02:09:19.609 --> 02:09:19.619 align:start position:0%
choosing a competitive supplier doesn't
 
02:09:22.129 --> 02:09:22.139 align:start position:0%
mean you leave your utility that they're
 
02:09:23.689 --> 02:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
not going to restore your service that
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to have outages that you
 
02:09:27.709 --> 02:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't otherwise have so please feel
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
free to refer folks there we do have a
 
02:09:33.050 --> 02:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
lot of information on our website and
 
02:09:35.570 --> 02:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
it's up to folks to go in and read that
 
02:09:37.490 --> 02:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
if they want but they can always call
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
and my folks will walk them through all
 
02:09:40.490 --> 02:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:09:42.290 --> 02:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
02:09:46.669 --> 02:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
friends uh I live in Lebanon and we are
 
02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
going to be having Community power
 
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
relatively soon I'm in the 94 percent of
 
02:09:57.229 --> 02:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
Liberty residential customers still on
 
02:09:59.930 --> 02:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
default service do you have any idea as
 
02:10:01.850 --> 02:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
to what sort of change we're going to be
 
02:10:07.810 --> 02:10:07.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:10.729 --> 02:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
well the promise of community power is
 
02:10:13.370 --> 02:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
that you'll see lower rates
 
02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:13.970 align:start position:0%
that you'll see lower rates
um

02:10:13.970 --> 02:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:15.770 --> 02:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
there's other
 
02:10:20.450 --> 02:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
benefits reported also I I really can't
 
02:10:22.250 --> 02:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
answer that I think that's going to
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
depend on when you go out to the market
 
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
who you get how long the contracts are
 
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.729 align:start position:0%
who you get how long the contracts are
uh

02:10:28.729 --> 02:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
so I probably say the best person to
 
02:10:35.930 --> 02:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
talk to up there is is Cliff Clifton
 
02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:37.310 align:start position:0%
talk to up there is is Cliff Clifton
below

02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
below
 
02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
and certainly in knowledgeable person
 
02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
about Community power
 
02:10:45.290 --> 02:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
02:10:49.669 --> 02:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
um in this chart
 
02:10:52.129 --> 02:10:52.139 align:start position:0%
um do you have any specific numbers for
 
02:10:52.139 --> 02:10:53.689 align:start position:0%
um do you have any specific numbers for
municipalities

02:10:53.689 --> 02:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
or is that absorbed in another category
 
02:11:00.589 --> 02:11:00.599 align:start position:0%
oh on the percent that have switched to
 
02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers yes yes I don't
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
have it broken down by community
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
and and we don't get the data that way I
 
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
I guess we could ask for it but we
 
02:11:14.810 --> 02:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
essentially get it by residential
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial customers okay
 
02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh Reynolds has
 
02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
a question also well actually Mr
 
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
chairman it's kind of a question for you
 
02:11:27.050 --> 02:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
my my colleagues mention of community
 
02:11:27.060 --> 02:11:29.209 align:start position:0%
my my colleagues mention of community
power

02:11:29.209 --> 02:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
power
 
02:11:31.970 --> 02:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
which is a significant development in
 
02:11:34.669 --> 02:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
the in this world that we're discussing
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.750 align:start position:0%
this morning
um

02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
it brings up in my mind a request
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
apparently since we've had to reschedule
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
the public utilities
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
commissions presentation to us would it
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
be possible to include on that perhaps
 
02:11:54.649 --> 02:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
on that rescheduled day a briefing from
 
02:11:56.689 --> 02:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
someone representing the community power
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps Clifton below himself and an
 
02:12:02.330 --> 02:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
expert so that we could understand how
 
02:12:04.990 --> 02:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
that significant development is going to
 
02:12:07.609 --> 02:12:07.619 align:start position:0%
affect you know what we're doing yes
 
02:12:09.410 --> 02:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent idea I will make
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
sure that that happens thank you thank
 
02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:12.470 align:start position:0%
sure that that happens thank you thank
you

02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:13.550 align:start position:0%
you
um

02:12:13.550 --> 02:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:15.770 --> 02:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
mindful of the
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
speakers that are still to come from the
 
02:12:20.270 --> 02:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
Department of energy as well as from The
 
02:12:22.010 --> 02:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
Office of Consumer Advocates so I just
 
02:12:24.649 --> 02:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
only have one more slide it's a overview
 
02:12:26.810 --> 02:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
slide of Energy Efficiency which is
 
02:12:29.930 --> 02:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
always a major topic and of interest for
 
02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
this committee it just really gives a
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
detail of the history recently in in the
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency world as we moved away
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
from an Energy Efficiency resource
 
02:12:42.970 --> 02:12:42.980 align:start position:0%
standard to an Energy Efficiency charge
 
02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
uh I will say that the most important
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
aspect of that is that a new three-year
 
02:12:50.649 --> 02:12:50.659 align:start position:0%
plan will be filed by the utilities
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much Mr Franz good
 
02:13:00.109 --> 02:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
to see you again and see you thank you
 
02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
appreciate you taking our questions
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
and next from the Department of energy
 
02:13:05.639 --> 02:13:10.330 align:start position:0%
and next from the Department of energy
is

02:13:10.330 --> 02:13:10.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman uh members of
 
02:13:24.589 --> 02:13:24.599 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record uh Josh
 
02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
Elliott I am the director of the
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
division of policy and programs at the
 
02:13:28.729 --> 02:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
um I do realize that we have a couple of
 
02:13:31.729 --> 02:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
other speakers left and it is already
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
quarter after 11. um I know you've had
 
02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
the rescheduled for the Public Utilities
 
02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
Commission so I just wanted to offer if
 
02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
the need be
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
um to the termination of the committee
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
if they'd like us to come back after
 
02:13:43.569 --> 02:13:43.579 align:start position:0%
lunch we can continue the presentation
 
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
if we find we are running short on time
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
by the time we hit 12 o'clock
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that offer we'll
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
have to negotiate that with the consumer
 
02:13:55.609 --> 02:13:55.619 align:start position:0%
Advocate but he's been very flexible so
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
far so I think we can probably work
 
02:13:59.569 --> 02:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
something out
 
02:14:01.129 --> 02:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
um so the division of policy and
 
02:14:05.930 --> 02:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
programs has a wide policy portfolio as
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
you can see on your screen here um the
 
02:14:09.530 --> 02:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
have the staff that work on the regional
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
market issues which I know we've
 
02:14:13.310 --> 02:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
discussed in detail we also have the
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
office of offshore wind industry
 
02:14:17.089 --> 02:14:17.099 align:start position:0%
development uh sustainable energy office
 
02:14:19.069 --> 02:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance program the
 
02:14:20.930 --> 02:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance program the
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
electric assistance program which we
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
participate sort of a halfway in between
 
02:14:27.050 --> 02:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
if you will we also manage the emergency
 
02:14:29.330 --> 02:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
benefits uh program that was established
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
by the legislature in the last session
 
02:14:33.649 --> 02:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2023
 
02:14:36.290 --> 02:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
we also have the consumer Services Group
 
02:14:37.970 --> 02:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
which Amanda Noonan has previously
 
02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
mentioned runs and then the state energy
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
program that Griffin Roberge runs as
 
02:14:44.750 --> 02:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
well as some of the federal funding
 
02:14:48.649 --> 02:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
coming through the bil or and the IRA
 
02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
so Regional markets I'll just leave this
 
02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
slide up I know we've discussed this
 
02:14:53.450 --> 02:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
extensively and I know we're short on
 
02:14:56.089 --> 02:14:56.099 align:start position:0%
time so I'll just continue on here but
 
02:14:59.089 --> 02:14:59.099 align:start position:0%
um again we're the staff look to ensure
 
02:15:00.169 --> 02:15:00.179 align:start position:0%
the interests of New Hampshire rate
 
02:15:01.609 --> 02:15:01.619 align:start position:0%
payers are being protected at the
 
02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
regional level
 
02:15:05.209 --> 02:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
uh the next one this is a very popular
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
topic uh the development of offshore
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
wind in the Gulf of Maine
 
02:15:13.490 --> 02:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
we have been tasked with the uh having
 
02:15:15.290 --> 02:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
the office of offshore wind industry
 
02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:16.370 align:start position:0%
the office of offshore wind industry
development

02:15:16.370 --> 02:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
development
 
02:15:17.629 --> 02:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
um so we have one person in there
 
02:15:19.850 --> 02:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
currently and she works with either
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
other state agencies primarily Des Bea
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
fish and game as well as our federal
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
counterparts um and other interested
 
02:15:29.209 --> 02:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
constituency groups whether it's labor
 
02:15:32.689 --> 02:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
organizations Fisheries Etc
 
02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
um on working through this offshore wind
 
02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
process as you can imagine it's very
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
very complicated I'm dealing with lease
 
02:15:42.649 --> 02:15:42.659 align:start position:0%
areas out in the Gulf of Maine dealing
 
02:15:44.089 --> 02:15:44.099 align:start position:0%
with various different constituency
 
02:15:45.290 --> 02:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
groups you have to make sure that
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
certain Environmental Protections are
 
02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
taken into place you know you're not
 
02:15:50.930 --> 02:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
going to have these wind turbines cited
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
in um
 
02:15:54.589 --> 02:15:54.599 align:start position:0%
travel lanes for shipping or in
 
02:15:56.689 --> 02:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
particular uh sensitive environmental
 
02:15:59.330 --> 02:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
areas so as you may know Gulf of Maine
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
is very attractive for offshore wind in
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
the case of it has very high wind speeds
 
02:16:07.310 --> 02:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
off the coast very high consistent wind
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
speeds which is good for electric
 
02:16:11.629 --> 02:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
generation the drawback is the waters
 
02:16:13.609 --> 02:16:13.619 align:start position:0%
are very deep so you can't actually put
 
02:16:15.410 --> 02:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
a pylon onto the surface of the ocean
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
floor like you would off sort of say the
 
02:16:20.450 --> 02:16:20.460 align:start position:0%
Long Island Sounder of Martha's Vineyard
 
02:16:22.430 --> 02:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
so you need floating technology which is
 
02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
still being worked on to being developed
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
which adds some additional complications
 
02:16:29.450 --> 02:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr chairman have a quick question
 
02:16:31.729 --> 02:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
from representative Harrington but thank
 
02:16:32.990 --> 02:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
question while we're speaking of
 
02:16:35.570 --> 02:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
offshore window I wonder if you could
 
02:16:37.310 --> 02:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
update us on what's going on with the
 
02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts projects because they have
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
active offshore wind projects I
 
02:16:42.530 --> 02:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
understand that the prices are being
 
02:16:45.410 --> 02:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
renegotiated this talk about delays due
 
02:16:47.389 --> 02:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
to supply chain problems and can you
 
02:16:49.070 --> 02:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
just give us an update on where that's
 
02:16:51.169 --> 02:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
at now because it's an active one being
 
02:16:53.450 --> 02:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
built yes sure um so I can provide just
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit of overview of that and I
 
02:16:56.810 --> 02:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
can get you a more detailed answer
 
02:17:00.049 --> 02:17:00.059 align:start position:0%
afterwards um as you may be aware
 
02:17:01.730 --> 02:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
um they have gone out
 
02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:02.389 align:start position:0%
um they have gone out
um

02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:04.310 --> 02:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
I believe it's Avant grid and I
 
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
apologize if I have the the name of the
 
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
company incorrect for several of these
 
02:17:10.969 --> 02:17:10.979 align:start position:0%
offshore wind uh turbine facilities
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
um off the coast of Massachusetts
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
um there were ppas in place purchased
 
02:17:16.669 --> 02:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
power agreements to
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
um uh buy various utilities to acquire
 
02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:20.150 align:start position:0%
um uh buy various utilities to acquire
this

02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
um electricity generated by these
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
offshore wind farms one of the
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
developers came back through the
 
02:17:26.330 --> 02:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Department of Public
 
02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission process essentially
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
saying that the guaranteed PPA rate
 
02:17:33.589 --> 02:17:33.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't enough for to make the project
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
economically viable
 
02:17:37.730 --> 02:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
um there were some negotiations went
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
back and forth um essentially the dpu
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
down there said uh either you go forward
 
02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
or you don't um so the project is going
 
02:17:48.530 --> 02:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
forward however I remain skeptical that
 
02:17:50.209 --> 02:17:50.219 align:start position:0%
it actually Will based on the developer
 
02:17:51.410 --> 02:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
saying that they can't make any money
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
doing it so I don't know what the next
 
02:17:55.490 --> 02:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
PATH forward is for that developer if
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
they sell their interest in the project
 
02:18:01.310 --> 02:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
um if they find some other means of
 
02:18:03.290 --> 02:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
getting out of the project I'm I'm not
 
02:18:06.290 --> 02:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
privy to what their uh their path
 
02:18:11.810 --> 02:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:13.849 --> 02:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
okay continue please
 
02:18:13.859 --> 02:18:15.770 align:start position:0%
okay continue please
oh

02:18:15.770 --> 02:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:18:18.589 --> 02:18:18.599 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is actually
 
02:18:22.370 --> 02:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
to follow up or fall Tale on
 
02:18:24.349 --> 02:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative herring's question
 
02:18:25.969 --> 02:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is
 
02:18:27.770 --> 02:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
well I actually have a question about
 
02:18:30.589 --> 02:18:30.599 align:start position:0%
why are they looking to negate or uh
 
02:18:33.049 --> 02:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
remove uh offshore
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
um and Nantucket Sound I know that's
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
ties in Massachusetts as well but I know
 
02:18:37.429 --> 02:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
nantucket's looking to negate it or
 
02:18:38.929 --> 02:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
removed as well
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of do you mean that to remove
 
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
it as a as a potential lease area or
 
02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get out of the
 
02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:45.469 align:start position:0%
trying to get out of the
um

02:18:45.469 --> 02:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:47.389 --> 02:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
the purchase power agreement trying to
 
02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
get out of the purchase power agreement
 
02:18:51.410 --> 02:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
yeah um oh I'm sorry my understanding is
 
02:18:53.389 --> 02:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
purely economical if the the developers
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
looked at the uh the math based on what
 
02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
they expect from revenue from the PPA
 
02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
versus how much they expect to actually
 
02:19:01.849 --> 02:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
develop this offshore wind farm and they
 
02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
don't think it's economically viable
 
02:19:05.389 --> 02:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
anymore so it's the high cost of it
 
02:19:07.370 --> 02:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
correct yes yes that's my from the
 
02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
developer's point of view again I'm not
 
02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
an expert on what's going on in
 
02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question as
 
02:19:18.349 --> 02:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:19:21.290 --> 02:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
Mr Elliott for being here today my
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
question is back in New Hampshire
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that there was one
 
02:19:26.330 --> 02:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
person in the office and it sounds like
 
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's a very complex thing to undertake
 
02:19:30.169 --> 02:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
this successfully so is there any plan
 
02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
to expand based on the work that's
 
02:19:34.730 --> 02:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
required or is this person so competent
 
02:19:35.629 --> 02:19:35.639 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be able to handle
 
02:19:38.330 --> 02:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
it so um we have uh Erica horn um she
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
has a tremendous amount of expertise
 
02:19:40.969 --> 02:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
actually she's used to work for the
 
02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
ports with Naval Shipyard so she's very
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
familiar with Maritime issues
 
02:19:46.310 --> 02:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
um where we are currently at in the
 
02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
process in terms of developing offshore
 
02:19:50.210 --> 02:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
wind we feel confident that having the
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
the one staff person
 
02:19:54.590 --> 02:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
um is is sufficient for now if that
 
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
changes of course we'll be here
 
02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
um to make that need uh known thank you
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:08.330 --> 02:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
um how does this re uh the developments
 
02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
in the offshore wind relate to the
 
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
current highest ever
 
02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:18.370 align:start position:0%
current highest ever
um

02:20:18.370 --> 02:20:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
rates would seem are they basically
 
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
ignoring that or even at these rates can
 
02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
they not make money
 
02:20:30.050 --> 02:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
I would say I don't know all of the math
 
02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
that has gone into
 
02:20:35.090 --> 02:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
the developers decision to pull out of
 
02:20:38.889 --> 02:20:38.899 align:start position:0%
that PPA so I I they have cited uh
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
inflationary costs and other costs in
 
02:20:43.490 --> 02:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
developing offshore wind I can't speak
 
02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:45.180 align:start position:0%
to the specifics of how they came to the
 
02:20:46.429 --> 02:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
conclusion of why they came to the
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
conclusion even given that the with the
 
02:20:51.950 --> 02:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
current high cost of electricity
 
02:20:56.330 --> 02:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.340 --> 02:20:57.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:20:59.690 --> 02:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
continue please
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
um next slide are sustainable energy so
 
02:21:03.770 --> 02:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
the department also uh and the division
 
02:21:06.349 --> 02:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
I should say uh manages the uh oversight
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
of the compliance of the renewable
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards so in statute
 
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement that both the
 
02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
provider's electricity I.E the electric
 
02:21:16.670 --> 02:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities as well as the
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers procure a certain
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
percentage of their electricity from
 
02:21:23.330 --> 02:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
certain renewable resources those are
 
02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
class one which um it's a sort of
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
various different types of sources
 
02:21:31.070 --> 02:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
including wind Class 2 which is solar
 
02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
class 3 which is biomass and class 4
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
which is small scale Hydra so all those
 
02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
combined come to 24 in 2022 will come to
 
02:21:45.889 --> 02:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
22.5 percent of the um total so there is
 
02:21:48.770 --> 02:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh and I should say um uh one of my
 
02:21:51.050 --> 02:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
colleagues Deandra peruccio who runs the
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy group um some of you
 
02:21:54.889 --> 02:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
may remember Karen Crampton she is the
 
02:21:56.809 --> 02:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
new Karen Crampton if you will
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
um we'll go into more detail about this
 
02:21:59.929 --> 02:21:59.939 align:start position:0%
but this is just sort of an overview and
 
02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
then she'll she'll dive into the details
 
02:22:07.010 --> 02:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
um so the way that the uh the energy
 
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
suppliers can comply with renewable
 
02:22:10.969 --> 02:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards is they can do one
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
of two things they can purchase or
 
02:22:14.929 --> 02:22:14.939 align:start position:0%
acquire which are called renewable
 
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
energy certificates so essentially it's
 
02:22:18.410 --> 02:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
the renewable attributes of energy
 
02:22:18.420 --> 02:22:19.670 align:start position:0%
the renewable attributes of energy
generation

02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
generation
 
02:22:21.889 --> 02:22:21.899 align:start position:0%
so they can do that they then retire
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
those certificates which then count
 
02:22:27.410 --> 02:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
towards their RPS compliance they can
 
02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:28.610 align:start position:0%
towards their RPS compliance they can
also

02:22:28.610 --> 02:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
um do what is called an ACP or
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payment if they
 
02:22:34.429 --> 02:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
are unable or unwilling
 
02:22:36.530 --> 02:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
um to acquire renewable energy
 
02:22:38.030 --> 02:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
certificates they can essentially make a
 
02:22:39.530 --> 02:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
penalty payment for lack of a better way
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
of putting it to the state in order to
 
02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
make up for those renewable energy
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
certificates they weren't able to
 
02:22:50.570 --> 02:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
acquire the rate for acps is to set in
 
02:22:53.330 --> 02:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
statute while and then indexed for
 
02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:54.950 align:start position:0%
statute while and then indexed for
inflation

02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
02:22:57.530 --> 02:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
um Rex renewable energy certificates
 
02:22:58.969 --> 02:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
um there's an open market for those so
 
02:23:00.530 --> 02:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
there are market prices that will drive
 
02:23:00.540 --> 02:23:01.490 align:start position:0%
there are market prices that will drive
those

02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:23:03.170 --> 02:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
um prices either higher or lower
 
02:23:04.670 --> 02:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
depending on supply and demand and
 
02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:07.130 align:start position:0%
depending on supply and demand and
availability

02:23:07.130 --> 02:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
availability
 
02:23:09.050 --> 02:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
um so where I'll do all those ACP
 
02:23:10.730 --> 02:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
payments that come in go so they go into
 
02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
which we have is the renewable energy
 
02:23:14.330 --> 02:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
fund so these are funded through those
 
02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments and they
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
go to provide for a myriad of different
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
resources but mostly they go back out to
 
02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
rate pairs in the form of Grant programs
 
02:23:25.849 --> 02:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
so we have two rebate programs
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
um actually gives me two residential
 
02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
rebate programs two commercial rebate
 
02:23:31.450 --> 02:23:31.460 align:start position:0%
programs as well as two competitive
 
02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
Grant programs
 
02:23:36.050 --> 02:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
um you can also oversee net metering
 
02:23:37.730 --> 02:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
which I know in the interest of time I
 
02:23:39.230 --> 02:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
know Deandra can get into the more
 
02:23:41.270 --> 02:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
details I know that is a common uh
 
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
subject before your committee and she
 
02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
can do a much better job of explain it
 
02:23:46.370 --> 02:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
than I can so
 
02:23:48.830 --> 02:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh next uh just a brief overview of the
 
02:23:50.330 --> 02:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
assistance programs that are run by the
 
02:23:52.190 --> 02:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
department uh Amanda Noonan who runs
 
02:23:53.690 --> 02:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
consumer will be up here to go into a
 
02:23:55.730 --> 02:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail but essentially
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
we have a number you can see that those
 
02:23:59.030 --> 02:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
Assistance programs on the screen
 
02:24:01.130 --> 02:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
whether it's for fuel assistance whether
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
it's for weatherization assistance
 
02:24:04.370 --> 02:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
whether it's for electric Assistance or
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's for these new um emergency benefit
 
02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
programs that were established by the
 
02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:09.969 align:start position:0%
programs that were established by the
legislature

02:24:09.969 --> 02:24:09.979 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:24:13.250 --> 02:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
the most important takeaway for this is
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
if you have constituents or your
 
02:24:16.370 --> 02:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
colleagues have constituents and they're
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
looking for help on these areas I know
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
with the price of electricity price of
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
fuel home feeding oils are very high
 
02:24:25.130 --> 02:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
contact your local Community Action
 
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
Agency so they're broken up by County
 
02:24:28.370 --> 02:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
Amanda Noonan we'll go into a little bit
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
more detail but that is the best place
 
02:24:32.809 --> 02:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
that they can go in order to get help
 
02:24:34.490 --> 02:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
there's one intake process they figure
 
02:24:35.870 --> 02:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
out where they're supposed to go which
 
02:24:37.730 --> 02:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
programs they are
 
02:24:39.950 --> 02:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
um which programs that they're eligible
 
02:24:41.929 --> 02:24:41.939 align:start position:0%
for and if they meet the income
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
requirements but it's
 
02:24:45.170 --> 02:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
um essentially it's up to 60 percent of
 
02:24:46.790 --> 02:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
Stadium median and income for the
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
regular programs and then it's 60 to 75
 
02:24:51.410 --> 02:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
percent for the uh new emergency
 
02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:55.270 align:start position:0%
percent for the uh new emergency
programs

02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
02:24:59.690 --> 02:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you and uh thank you
 
02:25:01.730 --> 02:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so just what you
 
02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
just said so in other words the the
 
02:25:05.929 --> 02:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
Community Action
 
02:25:09.650 --> 02:25:09.660 align:start position:0%
um agencies they actually do the leg
 
02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
work to to find out who qualifies before
 
02:25:16.370 --> 02:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
they come to you yes so we are um they
 
02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
they function as the subgrantees so we
 
02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
receive the the money from the federal
 
02:25:23.389 --> 02:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
government either it's from HHS or doe
 
02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
um the we then subcontract out with the
 
02:25:27.889 --> 02:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
Community Action agencies who then do
 
02:25:29.570 --> 02:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
all of the intake work so they will get
 
02:25:31.010 --> 02:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
folks who will come in they offer a
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
variety of other services other than
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
just these but they have a lot of those
 
02:25:36.530 --> 02:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
touch points with this sort of the same
 
02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:37.190 align:start position:0%
touch points with this sort of the same
um

02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
population so as they come in they can
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
say okay you were only interested in
 
02:25:43.070 --> 02:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
this okay we can also you know you can
 
02:25:44.570 --> 02:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
you're eligible for these programs if
 
02:25:45.469 --> 02:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
you're interested they could always
 
02:25:47.690 --> 02:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
decline if they're not but
 
02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
um they act as a subgrantee so we don't
 
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
have any interaction necessarily
 
02:25:52.969 --> 02:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
directly with the
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
um folks coming in to apply for these
 
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
programs that's all done at the
 
02:25:57.770 --> 02:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
Community Action Agency or they're also
 
02:26:03.230 --> 02:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:05.210 --> 02:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
okay continue thank you
 
02:26:07.969 --> 02:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
so uh consumer services again um Amanda
 
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
Noonan uh runs this group they help
 
02:26:12.889 --> 02:26:12.899 align:start position:0%
assist consumers dealing with regulated
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
utilities as you can imagine trying to
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
call a utility might be a bit of a
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
daunting task or trying to set up a
 
02:26:19.490 --> 02:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
payment plan things like that if
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
someone's behind on their bills
 
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
um they can uh she has a very capable
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
staff down there who know all the folks
 
02:26:26.929 --> 02:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
the utilities they can help the
 
02:26:29.210 --> 02:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
consumers to get the best possible
 
02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:30.349 align:start position:0%
consumers to get the best possible
outcome

02:26:30.349 --> 02:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
as they're dealing with utilities they
 
02:26:33.770 --> 02:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
also as we mentioned earlier help
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
provide some education experience uh
 
02:26:37.570 --> 02:26:37.580 align:start position:0%
resources for
 
02:26:40.130 --> 02:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
consumers uh competitive suppliers a
 
02:26:41.630 --> 02:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
perfect example of that there's a lot of
 
02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
information available on our website
 
02:26:45.290 --> 02:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
about what to think about as your may or
 
02:26:47.030 --> 02:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
may not be going uh over to a
 
02:26:48.650 --> 02:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier how you may want to
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
do that and lastly and again this is
 
02:26:53.210 --> 02:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
sort of very broad overview but they
 
02:26:55.130 --> 02:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
also participate in the regulatory
 
02:26:57.650 --> 02:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
processes that Tom Franz mentioned
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
earlier to make sure that there are
 
02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
certain things for the consumer that are
 
02:27:03.770 --> 02:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
taken into account when maybe new
 
02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
methods or new processes are being
 
02:27:08.030 --> 02:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
considered as part of the
 
02:27:10.370 --> 02:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh utilities uh regular course of
 
02:27:10.380 --> 02:27:11.389 align:start position:0%
uh utilities uh regular course of
business

02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
finally this is a very hot topic Federal
 
02:27:16.190 --> 02:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
funding for the Department So currently
 
02:27:17.929 --> 02:27:17.939 align:start position:0%
we have our standard program which is
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
sap State energy program that Griffin
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
Roberge who will come to know and love
 
02:27:24.830 --> 02:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
if you don't already manages we uh part
 
02:27:27.530 --> 02:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
of that money pays for staff at goe uh
 
02:27:30.410 --> 02:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doe we also run our seed
 
02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
program which provides grants to school
 
02:27:34.610 --> 02:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
districts to do Energy Efficiency
 
02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:35.990 align:start position:0%
districts to do Energy Efficiency
projects

02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
projects
 
02:27:37.490 --> 02:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
I also do the 10-year State energy
 
02:27:40.190 --> 02:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
strategy which given our time here I'm
 
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
not sure if I'm going to be able to go
 
02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
into detail but I'm always happy to come
 
02:27:45.889 --> 02:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
back the two biggest things in terms of
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
the federal funding that we're looking
 
02:27:49.790 --> 02:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
at um is the bipartisan infrastructure
 
02:27:51.530 --> 02:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
law it's either referred to as the bil
 
02:27:53.809 --> 02:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
or the iija they're both the same thing
 
02:27:56.270 --> 02:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
as well as the inflation reduction actor
 
02:27:58.730 --> 02:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
the IRA Griffin is going to go into more
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
detail about the specific programs for
 
02:28:01.969 --> 02:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
each of these but I realized that there
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
I've heard that there's a rumor out here
 
02:28:06.050 --> 02:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
that we are the New Hampshire doe is not
 
02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
going after some of the home of Energy
 
02:28:09.530 --> 02:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
Efficiency rebate programs that are
 
02:28:11.870 --> 02:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
provided for in the ira I can tell you
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
that is not true we are going after
 
02:28:15.410 --> 02:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
02:28:17.450 --> 02:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
um not sure where the rumor started but
 
02:28:19.370 --> 02:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
I can assure you those are formula funds
 
02:28:21.710 --> 02:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
and we're going after those funds
 
02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
um speaking of formula funds would be a
 
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
good point to discuss the difference
 
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
between formula and competitive funds
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
that are coming through these both of
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
these bills formula funds essentially
 
02:28:32.889 --> 02:28:32.899 align:start position:0%
there's a formula at the federal level
 
02:28:35.330 --> 02:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
that determines the allocation that each
 
02:28:38.270 --> 02:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
state will get or in some cases counties
 
02:28:41.690 --> 02:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
or or individual local government units
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
um essentially the federal government
 
02:28:45.530 --> 02:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
has said based on population various
 
02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
Myriad of other factors New Hampshire is
 
02:28:51.170 --> 02:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
eligible for this amount you can apply
 
02:28:52.370 --> 02:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
for it if you want to you don't have to
 
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
but you really should so those are
 
02:28:56.570 --> 02:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
formula funds there's an application
 
02:28:58.250 --> 02:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
process we have to make sure that our
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
application conforms with the guidance
 
02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's provided by the federal
 
02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:02.110 align:start position:0%
that's provided by the federal
government

02:29:02.110 --> 02:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:29:05.809 --> 02:29:05.819 align:start position:0%
we then apply for the funds and then we
 
02:29:08.210 --> 02:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
in theory if the application is accepted
 
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
we then receive those funds and then we
 
02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
go through the regular State processes
 
02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
whether it's governor and Council on
 
02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
fiscal approval to accept and expend
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
those funds there are others that are
 
02:29:19.370 --> 02:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
competitively awarded and usually for a
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
specific type of project whether it's
 
02:29:23.389 --> 02:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
the hydrogen hubs or if it's carbon
 
02:29:23.399 --> 02:29:24.950 align:start position:0%
the hydrogen hubs or if it's carbon
sequestration

02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
sequestration
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
um you know those will come um uh
 
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
probably further down in the line in
 
02:29:31.250 --> 02:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
terms of uh when they'll be noticed for
 
02:29:33.410 --> 02:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
availability for funding
 
02:29:35.210 --> 02:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
um just in terms of the processes um it
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
is a very long drawn out process if you
 
02:29:38.929 --> 02:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
imagine usdoe has got a lot of programs
 
02:29:40.250 --> 02:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
to set out in a very short amount of
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
time with
 
02:29:43.250 --> 02:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
um not a lot of staff to do it so
 
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
they're uh
 
02:29:46.429 --> 02:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
um they're trying their best
 
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and we are we're working through
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
those processes
 
02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
very good uh representative Harrington
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
has a question for you thank you Mr
 
02:29:55.250 --> 02:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned the hydrogen hubs
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
I've been seeing that there's been some
 
02:30:00.349 --> 02:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
activity with some other states I think
 
02:30:02.210 --> 02:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
Wyoming was one of them to try to work
 
02:30:05.630 --> 02:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
with other states to come up with a uh a
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
a proposal to get one of these hydrogen
 
02:30:10.370 --> 02:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
hubs because there's literally hundreds
 
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
of millions of dollars involved is there
 
02:30:13.969 --> 02:30:13.979 align:start position:0%
any type of movement in New England to
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
do something like that uh yes so there's
 
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
a regional one right now it's headed up
 
02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
by New York
 
02:30:19.849 --> 02:30:19.859 align:start position:0%
um they're looking at a couple of states
 
02:30:21.290 --> 02:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
in the Mid-Atlantic as well as New
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
England um to be part of a regional
 
02:30:24.410 --> 02:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
hydrogen hub
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire would be part of that
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
then oh possibly I need to be careful
 
02:30:30.050 --> 02:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
about how I talk about this but we are
 
02:30:35.330 --> 02:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
well looking through the uh the rest of
 
02:30:40.969 --> 02:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
the handout that you uh the department
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
gave us earlier it looks to me as if I
 
02:30:46.610 --> 02:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
should have devoted the entire day today
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
to the Department of energy rather than
 
02:30:50.690 --> 02:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
just two hours
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
and we have about
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
28 minutes left until our traditional
 
02:30:57.770 --> 02:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
lunch break so I'm going to suggest that
 
02:31:00.889 --> 02:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
we do the net metering component and
 
02:31:03.650 --> 02:31:03.660 align:start position:0%
then come back after lunch and do the
 
02:31:05.929 --> 02:31:05.939 align:start position:0%
rest of the components of your
 
02:31:08.210 --> 02:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
presentation is that acceptable to the
 
02:31:09.710 --> 02:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
department I'm going to look to the
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
people behind me who have to also press
 
02:31:12.650 --> 02:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
and present okay I'm getting thumbs up
 
02:31:14.929 --> 02:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
02:31:17.210 --> 02:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
Mr crease is that acceptable to the
 
02:31:21.650 --> 02:31:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:23.929 --> 02:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
thank you but that's what we'll do then
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have
 
02:31:28.730 --> 02:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
a presentation on net metering then we
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
will take a lunch break and we'll come
 
02:31:31.849 --> 02:31:31.859 align:start position:0%
back for the rest of the presentations
 
02:31:34.490 --> 02:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh in the handout so thank you very much
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you Mr chairman um and
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
then with me is uh Deandra perusio who
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
runs the sustainable energy group
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
um oh um so I will let her take over
 
02:31:44.990 --> 02:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
from here
 
02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:45.950 align:start position:0%
from here
morning

02:31:45.950 --> 02:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:48.290 align:start position:0%
morning
thanks

02:31:48.290 --> 02:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:31:50.929 --> 02:31:50.939 align:start position:0%
uh so yeah some of you may have known
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
Karen Crampton uh who's moved on those
 
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
are big shoes to Phil she was a very
 
02:31:58.969 --> 02:31:58.979 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable resource I'm sure uh I was
 
02:32:01.130 --> 02:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
an analyst under her and I've stepped up
 
02:32:03.950 --> 02:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
into the position as the administrator
 
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
for the sustainable team
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
so in coordination with the regulatory
 
02:32:12.349 --> 02:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
division consumer affairs we are
 
02:32:14.690 --> 02:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
responsible for implementing
 
02:32:18.170 --> 02:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh some of the rsas including net
 
02:32:21.469 --> 02:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
metering and the renewable portfolio
 
02:32:24.050 --> 02:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
standard so we're gonna focus on net
 
02:32:27.889 --> 02:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
metering first I'm I'm gonna go pretty
 
02:32:30.170 --> 02:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
slow on a very basic understanding so I
 
02:32:32.270 --> 02:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
apologize for folks who this may you may
 
02:32:33.889 --> 02:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
already know all of this but it'll be
 
02:32:36.469 --> 02:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully a good reminder
 
02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
so net metering how does that work
 
02:32:41.210 --> 02:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
you're basically putting some solar
 
02:32:43.370 --> 02:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
panels on your home technically this can
 
02:32:46.130 --> 02:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
be any distributed generation resource
 
02:32:48.170 --> 02:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
mostly in the state we see a lot of
 
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
solar especially at the residential
 
02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:51.170 align:start position:0%
solar especially at the residential
scale

02:32:51.170 --> 02:32:51.180 align:start position:0%
scale
 
02:32:54.830 --> 02:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
those that that generator is creating
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
energy at your home or business that's
 
02:33:01.730 --> 02:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
then converted from the panels uh to the
 
02:33:04.490 --> 02:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
the type of power that your house uses
 
02:33:07.309 --> 02:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
if your house is using power at the time
 
02:33:09.469 --> 02:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
that generation is occurring or your
 
02:33:11.330 --> 02:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
business is using power at the time that
 
02:33:13.969 --> 02:33:13.979 align:start position:0%
generation is occurring the power will
 
02:33:16.250 --> 02:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
be used by you know you have a TV on
 
02:33:18.590 --> 02:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
you're running a washing machine that is
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
behind the meter usage so that power is
 
02:33:24.290 --> 02:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
never seen by the the electric grid it
 
02:33:27.050 --> 02:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
gets basically used on site and is is
 
02:33:30.889 --> 02:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
behind the meter usage if however you're
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
not home and you're you're you know it's
 
02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
a sunny day and your system is producing
 
02:33:40.250 --> 02:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of energy that excess generation
 
02:33:42.770 --> 02:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
if you are eligible to net meter in New
 
02:33:44.270 --> 02:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you meet the requirements
 
02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
to interconnect to the electric grid
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
that power is then uh exported back out
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
onto the electric grid and that is net
 
02:33:55.309 --> 02:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
metering that is um for systems in New
 
02:33:58.370 --> 02:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire up to one megawatt you're
 
02:33:59.809 --> 02:33:59.819 align:start position:0%
allowed to net meter in New Hampshire
 
02:34:02.690 --> 02:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
and partake of this particular tariff
 
02:34:05.330 --> 02:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
although it also five megawatts of your
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
Municipal group host and we'll talk in a
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail about how that
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
works but General customers one megawatt
 
02:34:14.929 --> 02:34:14.939 align:start position:0%
is the capacity limit
 
02:34:16.910 --> 02:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
there are two different types of
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
customer generators so there's a large
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
customer generator and these are defined
 
02:34:23.090 --> 02:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
in the statute large customer generators
 
02:34:25.790 --> 02:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
and small customer generators small
 
02:34:28.550 --> 02:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
customer generators or any any systems
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
up to 100 KW in size a typical home
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
system we're seeing like 10 KW or so so
 
02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
this would small customer generators
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
could be both residents and then you
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
know businesses up to 100 KW
 
02:34:49.010 --> 02:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
and they have a specific tariff in place
 
02:34:52.130 --> 02:34:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh if you think back to Tom's slide of
 
02:34:53.870 --> 02:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
the different portions on your electric
 
02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:55.090 align:start position:0%
the different portions on your electric
bill

02:34:55.090 --> 02:34:55.100 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
this slide here goes over which portions
 
02:35:03.410 --> 02:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh of those credits are eligible for
 
02:35:05.450 --> 02:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
customers that are exporting excess
 
02:35:05.460 --> 02:35:08.150 align:start position:0%
customers that are exporting excess
generation

02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.650 --> 02:35:11.660 align:start position:0%
so one important point is that for
 
02:35:14.510 --> 02:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
four net metering this only covers
 
02:35:17.690 --> 02:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
volumetric charges so it's it's kwh
 
02:35:19.490 --> 02:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
charges so you're not you're not
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
avoiding a customer charge or if you're
 
02:35:23.630 --> 02:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
a business you're not avoiding a demand
 
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
charge you can't avoid those through
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
that net metering
 
02:35:31.969 --> 02:35:31.979 align:start position:0%
for small customer generators
 
02:35:34.130 --> 02:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
oh and the other important piece here
 
02:35:36.110 --> 02:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's an M1 the
 
02:35:38.330 --> 02:35:38.340 align:start position:0%
standard net metering tariff and M2
 
02:35:41.450 --> 02:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
which is the alternative tariff the
 
02:35:43.790 --> 02:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
standard Tariff was in place when the
 
02:35:46.429 --> 02:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
net metering was put in into statute
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
originally there was since that occurred
 
02:35:52.429 --> 02:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
there's been a docket that reviewed the
 
02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
Tariff the Tariff was changed by the
 
02:35:57.050 --> 02:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
commission 2016.
 
02:35:59.809 --> 02:35:59.819 align:start position:0%
so the alternative tariff is the Tariff
 
02:36:01.849 --> 02:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
that went into place starting September
 
02:36:04.309 --> 02:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
1 2017 so any systems that are going
 
02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
online as of September 1 2017 are under
 
02:36:10.130 --> 02:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
this alternative net metering tariffs
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm focusing on it's you
 
02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
know new systems coming online since
 
02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:17.270 align:start position:0%
know new systems coming online since
2017.

02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
2017.
 
02:36:20.929 --> 02:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
and oh so sorry to those customers those
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
small customer generators are eligible
 
02:36:26.450 --> 02:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
to receive 100 of the energy Supply
 
02:36:28.429 --> 02:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
portion so if you think back to Tom's
 
02:36:30.349 --> 02:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
chart that was you know the bulk it's
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
typically the largest portion of your
 
02:36:37.010 --> 02:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
bill so uh folks are compensated 100 for
 
02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:37.969 align:start position:0%
bill so uh folks are compensated 100 for
that

02:36:37.969 --> 02:36:37.979 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:42.050 --> 02:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
25 of the distribution portion of your
 
02:36:47.389 --> 02:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
bill uh and then 100 of the transmission
 
02:36:50.929 --> 02:36:50.939 align:start position:0%
there is a set of costs referred to as
 
02:36:54.110 --> 02:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
non-by-passable charges uh customer
 
02:36:56.690 --> 02:36:56.700 align:start position:0%
generators are not compensated if they
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
export power they are not compensated
 
02:37:01.309 --> 02:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
for non-bypassable charges and they also
 
02:37:01.319 --> 02:37:02.510 align:start position:0%
for non-bypassable charges and they also
pay

02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
pay
 
02:37:05.389 --> 02:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh the costs of non-bypassable chargers
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
for all power that they import from the
 
02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:08.690 align:start position:0%
for all power that they import from the
grid

02:37:08.690 --> 02:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
grid
 
02:37:10.910 --> 02:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
one big difference between the standard
 
02:37:13.370 --> 02:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
tariff and the alternative tariff a
 
02:37:15.710 --> 02:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
change that occurred there was a
 
02:37:19.250 --> 02:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
previously credits were kept on people's
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
bill as a kwh credit and carried forward
 
02:37:26.270 --> 02:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
month to month credits now under the 27
 
02:37:29.210 --> 02:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
2017 and on under the alternative tariff
 
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
are calculated each month as a monetary
 
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
credit based on this tariff So based on
 
02:37:37.550 --> 02:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
these percentages they calculate if you
 
02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
did export how much was exported times
 
02:37:43.250 --> 02:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
these values and you get an actual
 
02:37:45.469 --> 02:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
monetary credit on your bill that then
 
02:37:48.050 --> 02:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
carries forward throughout the year you
 
02:37:51.230 --> 02:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
have an option to cash that out once per
 
02:37:53.330 --> 02:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
year as long as that credit on your bill
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
is over one hundred dollars
 
02:37:58.250 --> 02:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
so those that small the tariffer small
 
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
customer generators
 
02:38:02.690 --> 02:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
and then we have large customer
 
02:38:04.610 --> 02:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
generators so these are systems anything
 
02:38:09.530 --> 02:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
over 100 KW and up to a megawatt except
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
for the new Municipal group hosts can be
 
02:38:14.690 --> 02:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
up to five megawatts but all of those
 
02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
facilities would be considered large
 
02:38:18.590 --> 02:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
customer generators and fall under this
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
tariff one important item to note is
 
02:38:24.170 --> 02:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
that for large customer generators in
 
02:38:27.410 --> 02:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if you are not you you
 
02:38:29.929 --> 02:38:29.939 align:start position:0%
have to use 20 of your power behind the
 
02:38:32.410 --> 02:38:32.420 align:start position:0%
meter so on site like I was describing
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
at the facility or you are required to
 
02:38:39.650 --> 02:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
become a group to be eligible to net
 
02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
meter in New Hampshire so you either
 
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
have to use 20 percent of that power
 
02:38:45.650 --> 02:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
behind the meter or you have to register
 
02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
as a group and act as a group host and
 
02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
for these generators and potentially
 
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
groups the credit the Tariff is the the
 
02:38:58.730 --> 02:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
energy Supply portion
 
02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
so they receive just that portion of
 
02:39:04.610 --> 02:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
credit for uh compensation for exported
 
02:39:04.620 --> 02:39:08.389 align:start position:0%
credit for uh compensation for exported
power

02:39:08.389 --> 02:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:10.490 --> 02:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
some of the basics for group net
 
02:39:14.570 --> 02:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
metering so this allows uh
 
02:39:16.969 --> 02:39:16.979 align:start position:0%
renewable energy facilities they can
 
02:39:19.610 --> 02:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
share the proceeds from net metering
 
02:39:22.429 --> 02:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
projects of their excess generation with
 
02:39:25.010 --> 02:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
other electric customers have to be in
 
02:39:27.710 --> 02:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
the same utility service territory so
 
02:39:31.730 --> 02:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
the customer generator in a group uh
 
02:39:31.740 --> 02:39:34.190 align:start position:0%
the customer generator in a group uh
what

02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:39:36.290 --> 02:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
would question me
 
02:39:38.210 --> 02:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington do you have a
 
02:39:38.220 --> 02:39:38.929 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington do you have a
question

02:39:38.929 --> 02:39:38.939 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:39:41.630 --> 02:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman uh just before
 
02:39:43.490 --> 02:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
you leave the slide on that metering on
 
02:39:45.710 --> 02:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
the last one I guess you were on
 
02:39:48.889 --> 02:39:48.899 align:start position:0%
um under the small ones you give uh we
 
02:39:50.410 --> 02:39:50.420 align:start position:0%
give full credit for transmission
 
02:39:52.849 --> 02:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
whether under the old tariff or the new
 
02:39:55.490 --> 02:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
tariff yet when they get larger one
 
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
there's no credit for transmission why
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
is there a difference
 
02:40:05.389 --> 02:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh that is a decision that was made by
 
02:40:07.490 --> 02:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
the Commission in determining the Tariff
 
02:40:11.410 --> 02:40:11.420 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know that that particular
 
02:40:15.130 --> 02:40:15.140 align:start position:0%
item changed from 26 from the original
 
02:40:17.929 --> 02:40:17.939 align:start position:0%
legislative net metering tariff to the
 
02:40:19.309 --> 02:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
new one
 
02:40:19.319 --> 02:40:20.090 align:start position:0%
new one
um

02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
but the Tariff values and you know which
 
02:40:26.210 --> 02:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
are basically effectively a percentage
 
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
of each type of charge uh was a decision
 
02:40:32.590 --> 02:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
by the commission and I think it's order
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
26029 and 2017 thank you that's it was a
 
02:40:44.090 --> 02:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.730 --> 02:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
so group net metering so the basics here
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
is you have your facility your customer
 
02:40:52.690 --> 02:40:52.700 align:start position:0%
generator that's the the solar the hydro
 
02:40:56.450 --> 02:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh that is the host that meter is the
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
host meter these can be again up to one
 
02:41:02.809 --> 02:41:02.819 align:start position:0%
megawatt or if you are a municipal group
 
02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
host which is a newly enabled type of
 
02:41:08.990 --> 02:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
group those can be up to five megawatts
 
02:41:12.290 --> 02:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh and as I stated previously large
 
02:41:14.090 --> 02:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
customer generators you know if you're
 
02:41:16.070 --> 02:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
not using more than 20 behind the meter
 
02:41:18.889 --> 02:41:18.899 align:start position:0%
you have to you are required to become a
 
02:41:23.870 --> 02:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
the programs that we offer under group
 
02:41:27.469 --> 02:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
net metering these are all enabled
 
02:41:28.910 --> 02:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
through statute so we have the
 
02:41:31.630 --> 02:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
admissible group Host this was I believe
 
02:41:35.950 --> 02:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
2021 House Bill 315 that enables
 
02:41:39.230 --> 02:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
Municipal group hosts uh these are four
 
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions as defined in the
 
02:41:43.370 --> 02:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
statute I think I have another slide on
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
that that I'll go over that in a little
 
02:41:46.250 --> 02:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
more detail and they can be up to five
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
megawatts in capacity
 
02:41:51.889 --> 02:41:51.899 align:start position:0%
we have LMI Community solar projects we
 
02:41:54.110 --> 02:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
refer to this informally as the LMI
 
02:41:55.969 --> 02:41:55.979 align:start position:0%
Adder groups
 
02:42:00.590 --> 02:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh this was 2019 SB 165 that enabled
 
02:42:02.570 --> 02:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
these projects they have to meet a
 
02:42:04.730 --> 02:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
number of requirements that are defined
 
02:42:07.309 --> 02:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
in the statute and then are therefore as
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
a group eligible for an additional two
 
02:42:13.610 --> 02:42:13.620 align:start position:0%
and a half cents per kilowatt hour for
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
the exported power that they generate
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
and then newly in 2022 SB 270 is an
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
additional LMI Community solar project
 
02:42:27.770 --> 02:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
type of group Arrangement which focuses
 
02:42:30.050 --> 02:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
specifically on the electric assistance
 
02:42:32.090 --> 02:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
program and customers that are eligible
 
02:42:34.969 --> 02:42:34.979 align:start position:0%
for that program and we are currently
 
02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:41.929 --> 02:42:41.939 align:start position:0%
I won't spend although we will be coming
 
02:42:43.550 --> 02:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
back so I guess maybe we do have some
 
02:42:47.150 --> 02:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
time but uh the municipal group hosts
 
02:42:51.110 --> 02:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
projects so these are effectively
 
02:42:54.349 --> 02:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
designed to support towns I believe in
 
02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
state government
 
02:42:59.389 --> 02:42:59.399 align:start position:0%
um facilities so all of the members are
 
02:43:01.610 --> 02:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
required to be political subdivisions
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
which is outlined in the definition in
 
02:43:05.170 --> 02:43:05.180 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
the host itself the host could be a
 
02:43:11.210 --> 02:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
private developer it could be a town or
 
02:43:14.570 --> 02:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
government entity and
 
02:43:18.110 --> 02:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
if it's a new facility it is required
 
02:43:20.870 --> 02:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
that the the host project be in the same
 
02:43:23.929 --> 02:43:23.939 align:start position:0%
municipality as all of the members and
 
02:43:25.130 --> 02:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
then the members are you know
 
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
effectively need to be Town entities or
 
02:43:30.770 --> 02:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
state entities it's it's outlined their
 
02:43:33.469 --> 02:43:33.479 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions so folks would
 
02:43:36.050 --> 02:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
comment again they apply to us any folk
 
02:43:37.969 --> 02:43:37.979 align:start position:0%
any people that would like to register
 
02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
as group hosts and create groups in New
 
02:43:42.889 --> 02:43:42.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they register uh they submit
 
02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
an application to our department we
 
02:43:46.730 --> 02:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
review that in coordination with the
 
02:43:48.410 --> 02:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
utilities and we would approve it so we
 
02:43:50.090 --> 02:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
would review all of these items to make
 
02:43:51.410 --> 02:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
sure they're meeting the requirements
 
02:43:51.420 --> 02:43:52.610 align:start position:0%
sure they're meeting the requirements
and

02:43:52.610 --> 02:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
um prove their projects
 
02:44:01.250 --> 02:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
the LMI Adder it is designed to create
 
02:44:05.450 --> 02:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
additional credit for low to moderate
 
02:44:08.389 --> 02:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
income residents in New Hampshire so
 
02:44:09.770 --> 02:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
there's the addition of two and a half
 
02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour for these for
 
02:44:14.330 --> 02:44:14.340 align:start position:0%
excess generation for these projects
 
02:44:16.250 --> 02:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
should they meet all of the eligibility
 
02:44:19.130 --> 02:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
requirements which are outlined within
 
02:44:21.889 --> 02:44:21.899 align:start position:0%
the statute uh
 
02:44:24.410 --> 02:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
a number of different requirements on
 
02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
load and generation but probably one of
 
02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
the most important is that you have to
 
02:44:31.130 --> 02:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
have a group of at least five
 
02:44:34.490 --> 02:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
residential end user customers of which
 
02:44:37.010 --> 02:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
the majority of those need to be low
 
02:44:38.929 --> 02:44:38.939 align:start position:0%
moderate income as defined by the
 
02:44:38.939 --> 02:44:42.530 align:start position:0%
moderate income as defined by the
statute

02:44:42.530 --> 02:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:45.950 --> 02:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
and then the new uh Eep
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
LMI Adder projects this was enabled
 
02:44:52.570 --> 02:44:52.580 align:start position:0%
through SB 270 just last session 2022
 
02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
that establishes a similar two and a
 
02:44:57.230 --> 02:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
half cent They will also be taking
 
02:45:01.010 --> 02:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
advantage of the LMI Adder this focuses
 
02:45:04.730 --> 02:45:04.740 align:start position:0%
specifically on a set of customers that
 
02:45:06.230 --> 02:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
are either already on the electric
 
02:45:08.389 --> 02:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
assistance program are eligible for the
 
02:45:11.330 --> 02:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
assistance program which will be the
 
02:45:14.450 --> 02:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
list will be developed by the utility up
 
02:45:16.730 --> 02:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
to six megawatts per year can be
 
02:45:19.730 --> 02:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
selected and deemed eligible as projects
 
02:45:23.090 --> 02:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
for these this type of incentive
 
02:45:23.100 --> 02:45:24.950 align:start position:0%
for these this type of incentive
and

02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:45:27.590 --> 02:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
it will enroll customers on an opt-out
 
02:45:30.889 --> 02:45:30.899 align:start position:0%
basis so folks will you know members of
 
02:45:33.410 --> 02:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
the Eep list will be notified it will be
 
02:45:35.389 --> 02:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
opt out they will be notified that they
 
02:45:38.030 --> 02:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
are you know being signed up for this
 
02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
program they will have the option to
 
02:45:42.650 --> 02:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
talk to their utility and opt out at any
 
02:45:45.950 --> 02:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
time but it is meant to reduce some of
 
02:45:48.830 --> 02:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
the administrative costs and burden of
 
02:45:50.889 --> 02:45:50.899 align:start position:0%
trying to have to go out and recruit
 
02:45:54.290 --> 02:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
customers so that
 
02:45:57.710 --> 02:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
will be an opt-out option
 
02:45:58.969 --> 02:45:58.979 align:start position:0%
stop you there for a second
 
02:46:01.730 --> 02:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
02:46:04.130 --> 02:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:46:06.710 --> 02:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh the six the six
 
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
megawatts per year is that a Statewide
 
02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:11.090 align:start position:0%
megawatts per year is that a Statewide
maximum

02:46:11.090 --> 02:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
maximum
 
02:46:14.389 --> 02:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
that is a Statewide cap yep so it'll be
 
02:46:16.790 --> 02:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking we're currently working on
 
02:46:18.830 --> 02:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
the details of how this program would be
 
02:46:21.530 --> 02:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
implemented based on the statute I think
 
02:46:23.570 --> 02:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
we're actually written comments from
 
02:46:25.250 --> 02:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we're doing a stakeholder
 
02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:27.020 align:start position:0%
processor due today by the end of today
 
02:46:29.929 --> 02:46:29.939 align:start position:0%
we're currently proposing that that is a
 
02:46:33.410 --> 02:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
you know a cap across the state and that
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
um potential projects will submit
 
02:46:38.210 --> 02:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
proposals for an RFP that will be
 
02:46:40.730 --> 02:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the department to distribute
 
02:46:43.849 --> 02:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
those six megawatts based on as is clear
 
02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
is clear in the statute the highest
 
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
credit to the LMI participants thank you
 
02:46:50.570 --> 02:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman I think I jumped
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
ahead of the line for misrepresentative
 
02:46:52.319 --> 02:46:53.870 align:start position:0%
ahead of the line for misrepresentative
lewicki

02:46:53.870 --> 02:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
lewicki
 
02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
a representative lewicki uh thank you Mr
 
02:46:57.889 --> 02:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:46:59.330 --> 02:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
question you may already have answered
 
02:47:02.690 --> 02:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
this but what is is there any uptake on
 
02:47:05.210 --> 02:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
this low and middle moderate income uh
 
02:47:08.210 --> 02:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
provision or is it not yet in place uh
 
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
enough to for anybody to actually be
 
02:47:12.770 --> 02:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
taking it yep
 
02:47:16.610 --> 02:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
and are you is this for the Eep
 
02:47:25.010 --> 02:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
yep so we did the LMI Adder which I
 
02:47:34.429 --> 02:47:34.439 align:start position:0%
think became effective out of 20 19 we
 
02:47:36.349 --> 02:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
have a grant program that was also
 
02:47:41.270 --> 02:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
enabled through that statute and we've
 
02:47:43.849 --> 02:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
had a few projects come online we have
 
02:47:46.730 --> 02:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
one group net metering project that is
 
02:47:48.590 --> 02:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
taking advantage and has registered for
 
02:47:50.690 --> 02:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
the LMI Adder so relatively new we did
 
02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:51.790 align:start position:0%
the LMI Adder so relatively new we did
actually

02:47:51.790 --> 02:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:47:55.250 --> 02:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
submit a report to the legislature I
 
02:47:57.889 --> 02:47:57.899 align:start position:0%
believe this past October giving an
 
02:48:00.349 --> 02:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
update on specifically the adder but we
 
02:48:02.929 --> 02:48:02.939 align:start position:0%
also talk about the grant programs that
 
02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
we're running focused on LMI as well so
 
02:48:09.170 --> 02:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
I think I have a link a little bit later
 
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
in the slides on that but it's
 
02:48:15.070 --> 02:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
definitely new and then the Eep program
 
02:48:18.830 --> 02:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
we are taking final comments on the
 
02:48:21.530 --> 02:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
proposal for implementing that hoping to
 
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
then submit a formal proposal for
 
02:48:26.270 --> 02:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
approval by our commissioner to run that
 
02:48:28.550 --> 02:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
program this calendar year so we are
 
02:48:30.650 --> 02:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
hoping to have an RFP out and be able to
 
02:48:32.450 --> 02:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
administer that program
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh for this this year hopefully first
 
02:48:44.110 --> 02:48:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:48.290 --> 02:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
upcoming fun things with net metering
 
02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
um you may be aware but there is and I
 
02:48:53.630 --> 02:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
think we did get a question around the
 
02:48:56.750 --> 02:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
value of distributed energy resources
 
02:48:59.750 --> 02:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
so there is a new docket opened at the
 
02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:00.730 align:start position:0%
so there is a new docket opened at the
commission

02:49:00.730 --> 02:49:00.740 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:49:04.070 --> 02:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
22060 that is an investigation into the
 
02:49:06.530 --> 02:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
net metering tariff structure other
 
02:49:09.050 --> 02:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
matters related to to net metering for
 
02:49:11.090 --> 02:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
customer generators
 
02:49:14.510 --> 02:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
the value the vder value of distributed
 
02:49:18.349 --> 02:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
energy resources study that study was
 
02:49:20.630 --> 02:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
ordered as part of the commission order
 
02:49:24.530 --> 02:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
from the 2016 docket
 
02:49:27.830 --> 02:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
so 2016 the commission changed the
 
02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
Tariff to this alternative net metering
 
02:49:32.270 --> 02:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
tariff they also ordered a number of
 
02:49:36.770 --> 02:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
studies and pilot projects to inform a
 
02:49:41.090 --> 02:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
future review of the Tariff so over you
 
02:49:43.809 --> 02:49:43.819 align:start position:0%
know the past few years we've the
 
02:49:45.950 --> 02:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
commission we were at the commission
 
02:49:48.309 --> 02:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
when this was ordered now the department
 
02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
we have had two studies completed one is
 
02:49:55.309 --> 02:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
the locational value of distributed
 
02:49:58.370 --> 02:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
resources and then also the the value of
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
just regenerative energy resources which
 
02:50:03.650 --> 02:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
is the system-wide value study so both
 
02:50:06.410 --> 02:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
of those were completed and submitted
 
02:50:09.050 --> 02:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
into the the new docket for
 
02:50:11.650 --> 02:50:11.660 align:start position:0%
consideration to inform both meant to
 
02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily provide a number but
 
02:50:17.809 --> 02:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
provide additional data to inform the
 
02:50:20.510 --> 02:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
conversation about a tariff regarding
 
02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:50:23.570 --> 02:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
02:50:26.150 --> 02:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
avoided costs that are being achieved as
 
02:50:28.490 --> 02:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
well as rate and Bill impacts which look
 
02:50:31.130 --> 02:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
at Cost shifting and magnitude and
 
02:50:34.670 --> 02:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
so we look forward to participating the
 
02:50:38.990 --> 02:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
pre-hearing conference was just this
 
02:50:41.330 --> 02:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
week and we look forward to being
 
02:50:45.469 --> 02:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
involved in that docket as it proceeds
 
02:50:50.090 --> 02:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
SB 270 the LMI Adder program the Eep
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
program specifically we were working on
 
02:50:55.250 --> 02:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
implementing that and then the New
 
02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire administrative 900 rules which
 
02:51:00.410 --> 02:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
are oversee all of these net metering
 
02:51:03.110 --> 02:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
items we are looking at updating those
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
rules based on some of these statutes
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
that have come in so that they are up to
 
02:51:08.640 --> 02:51:12.309 align:start position:0%
that have come in so that they are up to
date

02:51:12.309 --> 02:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
wonderful that's almost like a a perfect
 
02:51:18.410 --> 02:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
place for us to uh to take a break here
 
02:51:22.070 --> 02:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
so uh excellent presentation from the
 
02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
Department so far this morning and with
 
02:51:28.010 --> 02:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
everybody's uh without objection from
 
02:51:30.230 --> 02:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
everybody we'll come back at one o'clock
 
02:51:32.750 --> 02:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
and start again with the renewable
 
02:51:35.929 --> 02:51:35.939 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard continue on with the
 
02:51:37.849 --> 02:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
rest of the doe presentation and then
 
02:51:40.610 --> 02:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
immediately following that the office of
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate will present to
 
02:51:45.469 --> 02:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
the committee so for right now we're in
 
03:22:06.469 --> 03:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:16.670 --> 04:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
this is your one minute warning we'll
 
04:01:18.769 --> 04:01:18.779 align:start position:0%
start the proceedings again in one
 
04:01:18.779 --> 04:02:24.590 align:start position:0%
start the proceedings again in one
minute

04:02:24.590 --> 04:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay let us resume our activity for the
 
04:02:28.080 --> 04:02:30.349 align:start position:0%
okay let us resume our activity for the
day

04:02:30.349 --> 04:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:32.570 --> 04:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
just to refresh everyone's memory this
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
is the science technology and energy
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee and we have a presentation
 
04:02:39.710 --> 04:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing by the department of energy and
 
04:02:42.950 --> 04:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
we stopped the presentation for lunch
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
at the end of the net metering portion
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
of their
 
04:02:51.229 --> 04:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
presentations and I will pick it up with
 
04:02:53.630 --> 04:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard and
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
turn the microphone back over to Mr Josh
 
04:03:00.530 --> 04:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
Elliott good afternoon Mr chairman sorry
 
04:03:02.090 --> 04:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
um again for the record Josh Elliott
 
04:03:03.530 --> 04:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
director of the division of policy and
 
04:03:05.750 --> 04:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
programs um picking up at the end of
 
04:03:08.269 --> 04:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
deandra's uh presentation as the
 
04:03:09.530 --> 04:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
chairman mentioned talk about the
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard so see the
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
next slide here on the renewable
 
04:03:15.889 --> 04:03:15.899 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard was enacted in 2007
 
04:03:19.849 --> 04:03:19.859 align:start position:0%
and requires uh a certain percentage of
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
a electricity providers whether it's a
 
04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
distribute distribution utility or
 
04:03:25.790 --> 04:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier to procure a
 
04:03:27.410 --> 04:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of their electricity
 
04:03:27.420 --> 04:03:29.870 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of their electricity
from

04:03:29.870 --> 04:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:03:32.389 --> 04:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
renewable resources and those renewable
 
04:03:34.250 --> 04:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
resources are divided up into classes
 
04:03:36.410 --> 04:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
there's class one which is sort of a
 
04:03:37.610 --> 04:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
catch-all for a lot of other different
 
04:03:39.290 --> 04:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
Technologies so it's easier to find it
 
04:03:41.469 --> 04:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
as what it's not rather than what it is
 
04:03:45.229 --> 04:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
class 2 is new solar class three is
 
04:03:48.590 --> 04:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
biomass class four is small scale hydro
 
04:03:50.689 --> 04:03:50.699 align:start position:0%
and again going back to class one it's
 
04:03:53.389 --> 04:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
wind geothermal some of the other
 
04:03:55.250 --> 04:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
smaller Technologies aren't necessarily
 
04:03:57.950 --> 04:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
fit into the other three classes
 
04:04:01.370 --> 04:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
so how do does a
 
04:04:03.469 --> 04:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
provider electricity actually comply
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
with immobile portfolio standards so the
 
04:04:08.450 --> 04:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
best way I've heard this described is uh
 
04:04:10.729 --> 04:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
is you cannot track a single electron as
 
04:04:12.290 --> 04:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
it's moving through the system right so
 
04:04:13.490 --> 04:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
the best way I've heard it described is
 
04:04:14.929 --> 04:04:14.939 align:start position:0%
you take a glass of water you dump it
 
04:04:16.429 --> 04:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
into a swimming pool okay I want my
 
04:04:18.050 --> 04:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
glass of water back right you can't you
 
04:04:19.250 --> 04:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
can't find it you're never going to find
 
04:04:19.260 --> 04:04:19.969 align:start position:0%
can't find it you're never going to find
it

04:04:19.969 --> 04:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
so what renewable Technologies produce
 
04:04:25.130 --> 04:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
are called renewable energy certificates
 
04:04:26.929 --> 04:04:26.939 align:start position:0%
or wrecks essentially it is the
 
04:04:28.969 --> 04:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes of the electricity
 
04:04:28.979 --> 04:04:30.290 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes of the electricity
generation

04:04:30.290 --> 04:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
generation
 
04:04:33.170 --> 04:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine with any other uh
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
with electricity generation it goes to
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
wherever the demand is so for example I
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
live in Goffstown chances are if I were
 
04:04:40.670 --> 04:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
to actually figure out exactly what's
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
coming in through my meter it's probably
 
04:04:45.170 --> 04:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
either solar that's in the neighborhood
 
04:04:47.870 --> 04:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
natural gas from Granite Ridge or from
 
04:04:51.410 --> 04:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh the hydroelectric Dam at Glen Lake
 
04:04:54.349 --> 04:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
so in order to actually be able to
 
04:04:55.969 --> 04:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
um sell and trade those renewable
 
04:04:57.889 --> 04:04:57.899 align:start position:0%
attributes because I didn't pay for
 
04:05:00.170 --> 04:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
those specific renewable attributes
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
um the generator create or mint what are
 
04:05:04.130 --> 04:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
called Rex and those are certified
 
04:05:05.570 --> 04:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
through the department
 
04:05:06.530 --> 04:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
um that if they meet the certain
 
04:05:09.290 --> 04:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
criteria that they're eligible to Mint a
 
04:05:10.910 --> 04:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
certain type of class Rex so it's either
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
class one class two class three class
 
04:05:12.720 --> 04:05:13.849 align:start position:0%
class one class two class three class
four

04:05:13.849 --> 04:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:05:16.250 --> 04:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
so the providers of electricity the
 
04:05:17.929 --> 04:05:17.939 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities or the
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers then have to
 
04:05:20.990 --> 04:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
acquire these renewable energy
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
certificates in order to meet their RPS
 
04:05:26.030 --> 04:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
compliance so they have to get a certain
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
number to match their megawatt hours of
 
04:05:30.490 --> 04:05:30.500 align:start position:0%
energy sold electricity sold excuse me
 
04:05:34.250 --> 04:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
to match up for each of those classes
 
04:05:36.110 --> 04:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
so they can do that in either the way
 
04:05:37.610 --> 04:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
that I just described here's a little
 
04:05:39.290 --> 04:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
sorry there's a chart makes a little bit
 
04:05:41.510 --> 04:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
easier they can either acquire those
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates or they
 
04:05:45.650 --> 04:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
can do something else called making an
 
04:05:47.870 --> 04:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payment or an ACP
 
04:05:50.830 --> 04:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
essentially if there are not enough
 
04:05:53.090 --> 04:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
wrecks available in the market for
 
04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
purchase they can make one of these all
 
04:05:58.070 --> 04:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
of this alternative compliance payment
 
04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
now uh most of the time the alternative
 
04:06:04.130 --> 04:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
compliance payment is again is a set in
 
04:06:06.050 --> 04:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
statute it's set at a rate higher than
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
what would normally trade on the market
 
04:06:08.570 --> 04:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
for a wreck so there's a financial
 
04:06:10.429 --> 04:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
incentive to go out and procure these
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates and this
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
is meant to sort of as a backup option
 
04:06:16.010 --> 04:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
if for whatever reason the wrecks are
 
04:06:17.570 --> 04:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
not available on the market or there are
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
other distortions
 
04:06:19.080 --> 04:06:19.729 align:start position:0%
other distortions
um

04:06:19.729 --> 04:06:19.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:22.969 --> 04:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
these racks are publicly traded you can
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
acquire them they're bought and sold so
 
04:06:26.929 --> 04:06:26.939 align:start position:0%
it's just General market the price goes
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
up and down depending on the supply the
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
demand as well as obviously different
 
04:06:33.410 --> 04:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
state policy decisions
 
04:06:33.420 --> 04:06:34.490 align:start position:0%
state policy decisions
um

04:06:34.490 --> 04:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:38.030 --> 04:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to these uh renewable
 
04:06:40.610 --> 04:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
energy certificates again they there's
 
04:06:42.290 --> 04:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
this active Market that's trading back
 
04:06:44.570 --> 04:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
and forth some of the competitive
 
04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
suppliers for example if they have a
 
04:06:47.330 --> 04:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
very small load rather than going
 
04:06:49.610 --> 04:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
through the hassle of going out to
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
procure a very small number of wrecks
 
04:06:52.969 --> 04:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
they'll make the alternative compliance
 
04:06:54.650 --> 04:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
payment just because they're they're not
 
04:06:57.050 --> 04:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
doing as much their book of business is
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
not large enough to actually warrant
 
04:07:01.250 --> 04:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
going out to actually get them
 
04:07:03.469 --> 04:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
so where does all this Revenue come from
 
04:07:05.689 --> 04:07:05.699 align:start position:0%
where does it go so these um alternative
 
04:07:07.790 --> 04:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
compliance revenues are deposited into
 
04:07:10.010 --> 04:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
What's called the renewable energy fund
 
04:07:12.110 --> 04:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
um so we do a couple of different things
 
04:07:13.309 --> 04:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
um actually I'm going to go back to my
 
04:07:15.710 --> 04:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
last slide there we see the green circle
 
04:07:17.450 --> 04:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
um a small portion of it goes to pay for
 
04:07:19.370 --> 04:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
the administrative costs of actually
 
04:07:21.170 --> 04:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
managing the fund ensuring the
 
04:07:23.950 --> 04:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
compliance as well as
 
04:07:26.269 --> 04:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
overseeing the proper minting of those
 
04:07:28.610 --> 04:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
removable energy certificates
 
04:07:28.620 --> 04:07:29.330 align:start position:0%
removable energy certificates
um

04:07:29.330 --> 04:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
and then the balance goes into two
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
different programs it either goes into
 
04:07:34.250 --> 04:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
the residential rebate programs or it
 
04:07:36.050 --> 04:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
goes into the commercial industrial or
 
04:07:39.469 --> 04:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
cni rebate and Grant programs so on the
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
residential side we offer rebates for um
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
photovoltaic or solar or wind um based
 
04:07:46.610 --> 04:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
on a per watt basis uh it is currently
 
04:07:51.530 --> 04:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollars per installation
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
um we have a solar water heating rebate
 
04:07:55.210 --> 04:07:55.220 align:start position:0%
program which that is currently closed
 
04:07:58.370 --> 04:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
and then we have a residential wood
 
04:08:01.370 --> 04:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
pellet program so this up offers up to
 
04:08:02.689 --> 04:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars with additional
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
benefit uh
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
um uh bonus payments depending on the
 
04:08:08.150 --> 04:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
size of the actual
 
04:08:08.160 --> 04:08:08.870 align:start position:0%
size of the actual
um

04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
it's not a tank but it's a container
 
04:08:11.689 --> 04:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
where the wood pellets sit in the
 
04:08:11.699 --> 04:08:12.590 align:start position:0%
where the wood pellets sit in the
basement

04:08:12.590 --> 04:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
basement
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
there's an Adder based on the size of
 
04:08:16.370 --> 04:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
that that container
 
04:08:17.929 --> 04:08:17.939 align:start position:0%
um and these are these are programs
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
available to regular residential reg
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
payers for example the uh wood pellet
 
04:08:24.530 --> 04:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
with the increase in oil Natural Gas
 
04:08:26.929 --> 04:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
Propane Etc has actually seen a strong
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
uptick in demand of people swapping over
 
04:08:29.640 --> 04:08:30.349 align:start position:0%
uptick in demand of people swapping over
um

04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
to move off of fossil fuels we also have
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
the LMI competitive grant program I know
 
04:08:38.410 --> 04:08:38.420 align:start position:0%
there was a question earlier about that
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
we offer grants to folks who create
 
04:08:44.929 --> 04:08:44.939 align:start position:0%
these uh essentially solar arrays that
 
04:08:47.570 --> 04:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
the benefits then go to
 
04:08:47.580 --> 04:08:48.650 align:start position:0%
the benefits then go to
um

04:08:48.650 --> 04:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
benefit low and moderate income uh
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers as Deandra
 
04:08:55.070 --> 04:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned in her presentation there's
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
some difficulty administrative
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
difficulty in trying to track down those
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
folks which is what was Senate Bill 270
 
04:09:02.689 --> 04:09:02.699 align:start position:0%
is seeking to rectify but I don't know
 
04:09:03.950 --> 04:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
if any of you happen to live in the
 
04:09:05.809 --> 04:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton area or go up and down Route
 
04:09:08.510 --> 04:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
13 between Goffstown and Concord there's
 
04:09:12.290 --> 04:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
actually the latest grantee Oris has a
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
solar field that they just completed off
 
04:09:16.130 --> 04:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
of Route 13 and Dunbarton
 
04:09:18.889 --> 04:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
on the non-residential side we also do
 
04:09:20.929 --> 04:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
the same similar programs where we have
 
04:09:23.210 --> 04:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
a solar rebate program for businesses
 
04:09:25.790 --> 04:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
and again the same similar for
 
04:09:28.010 --> 04:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial customers for if
 
04:09:29.870 --> 04:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
they want to swap over to wood pellet
 
04:09:33.110 --> 04:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
programs we do the final program is a
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
non-competitive excuse me is a
 
04:09:36.889 --> 04:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
competitive program essentially if it's
 
04:09:39.429 --> 04:09:39.439 align:start position:0%
something that's not solar or not
 
04:09:45.229 --> 04:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
a biomass type of project for a business
 
04:09:47.269 --> 04:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
um it's sort of a outside the box
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
project if you will we offer funds
 
04:09:52.250 --> 04:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
available on a competitive basis to do
 
04:09:54.410 --> 04:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh to do these types of projects so
 
04:09:57.110 --> 04:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
we've seen everything from schools
 
04:09:59.689 --> 04:09:59.699 align:start position:0%
coming in to do different projects a lot
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
of them are actually uh um upgrading and
 
04:10:05.389 --> 04:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
refurbishing existing hydroelectric dams
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
in order to get either greater output or
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
bring them back online to actually
 
04:10:11.929 --> 04:10:11.939 align:start position:0%
generate electricity and generate those
 
04:10:11.939 --> 04:10:13.849 align:start position:0%
generate electricity and generate those
wrecks

04:10:13.849 --> 04:10:13.859 align:start position:0%
wrecks
 
04:10:16.010 --> 04:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chair
 
04:10:20.389 --> 04:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
um this is a question regarding the Rex
 
04:10:22.189 --> 04:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
is there a finite number that's
 
04:10:25.309 --> 04:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
available at any time
 
04:10:28.130 --> 04:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
um the only thing that um oh there you
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
are okay I'm by apologies um so the only
 
04:10:32.030 --> 04:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
thing that determines there's the only
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
limiting factor on the number of
 
04:10:34.910 --> 04:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
available wrecks is the number of
 
04:10:36.650 --> 04:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
generators creating them so there's not
 
04:10:38.210 --> 04:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
there's not a cap of say a million
 
04:10:39.170 --> 04:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
wrecks and that's all that can be
 
04:10:41.330 --> 04:10:41.340 align:start position:0%
produced in theory it's infinite it's
 
04:10:43.010 --> 04:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
just the matter of how many how many
 
04:10:47.889 --> 04:10:47.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:50.150 --> 04:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
04:10:52.130 --> 04:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:10:53.689 --> 04:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
um my question is around I've seen a lot
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
of signs around now for people wanting
 
04:10:57.530 --> 04:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
to do geothermal people are trying to
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
convert their homes in that way and I
 
04:11:00.769 --> 04:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
was wondering whether there are
 
04:11:03.769 --> 04:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
I don't think the current statutes cover
 
04:11:05.870 --> 04:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
that in terms of this funding for
 
04:11:09.170 --> 04:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
renewable but is there Federal funding
 
04:11:10.550 --> 04:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
or is there any way for people to get
 
04:11:12.170 --> 04:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
any offset on that because I know I have
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
people in my community that are looking
 
04:11:15.650 --> 04:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
into that that is something we could
 
04:11:17.330 --> 04:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
certainly look at doing um because
 
04:11:19.130 --> 04:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
geothermal if I recall correctly would
 
04:11:22.849 --> 04:11:22.859 align:start position:0%
be eligible for class one as a renewable
 
04:11:22.859 --> 04:11:24.130 align:start position:0%
be eligible for class one as a renewable
resource

04:11:24.130 --> 04:11:24.140 align:start position:0%
resource
 
04:11:26.330 --> 04:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
the department has a certain amount of
 
04:11:27.950 --> 04:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
latitude in terms of what we can and
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
can't use the the renewable energy fund
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
for in terms of setting up new programs
 
04:11:33.229 --> 04:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
it's sort of it's um particularly
 
04:11:35.630 --> 04:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
circumscribed in the statute but that is
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
certainly something we could we could
 
04:11:38.990 --> 04:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
look at doing I am not aware of any
 
04:11:42.170 --> 04:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
specific Federal program that helps in
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
terms of Beyond sort of like tax rebate
 
04:11:45.950 --> 04:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
sort of program to actually provide
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
actual funding for it I'm not aware of
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
anything off the top of my head but um I
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
can do some digging and get an answer
 
04:11:53.469 --> 04:11:53.479 align:start position:0%
back for you thank you
 
04:11:56.210 --> 04:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
representative mom uh Summers is
 
04:11:58.370 --> 04:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:12:01.729 --> 04:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
um quick question for you you mentioned
 
04:12:04.010 --> 04:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
on here about Rex and I'm curious we
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
talked earlier about how rates of for
 
04:12:08.809 --> 04:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
electricity have increased recently due
 
04:12:11.269 --> 04:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
to supply issues and with Rex being
 
04:12:14.030 --> 04:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
traded at a premium how much of the rate
 
04:12:16.189 --> 04:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
of the cost of Rex is being passed on to
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
those residents that do not provide
 
04:12:21.769 --> 04:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
their own power and how much does their
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill increase over that period of time
 
04:12:25.849 --> 04:12:25.859 align:start position:0%
sure um that's a very good question and
 
04:12:28.010 --> 04:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
actually reminds me of something that
 
04:12:29.809 --> 04:12:29.819 align:start position:0%
Tom France as he was leaving mentioned
 
04:12:31.130 --> 04:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
make sure you mention this when you're
 
04:12:32.809 --> 04:12:32.819 align:start position:0%
talking about Rex and I had forgotten so
 
04:12:34.910 --> 04:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for for that prompt
 
04:12:36.950 --> 04:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
um so the cost of compliance with the
 
04:12:38.389 --> 04:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard whether
 
04:12:40.729 --> 04:12:40.739 align:start position:0%
it's the making those acps or acquiring
 
04:12:44.030 --> 04:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
those wrecks is passed through to the
 
04:12:46.490 --> 04:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
rate payers it is of that pie chart that
 
04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
Tom Franz had on his slide it is baked
 
04:12:52.010 --> 04:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
into the default service so it is part
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
of that number that you see on the uh on
 
04:12:56.330 --> 04:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
that excuse me that you saw on that pie
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
chart I can no I was gonna say I should
 
04:13:01.309 --> 04:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
have grabbed this number ahead of time
 
04:13:03.170 --> 04:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
we do produce an annual report that has
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
the exact breakdown of how much the RPS
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
compliance costs
 
04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't have it right at my
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
fingertips and off the top of my head
 
04:13:12.170 --> 04:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
but while someone else is doing a
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
presentation I can get that figure
 
04:13:17.090 --> 04:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up follow-up okay uh
 
04:13:18.349 --> 04:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll ask excuse me I'm being
 
04:13:19.729 --> 04:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
prompted from the audience um last year
 
04:13:22.150 --> 04:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
was roughly 55 million across Statewide
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
55 million so with that incremental
 
04:13:27.229 --> 04:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
across if we went from one megawatt to
 
04:13:29.210 --> 04:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
let's say five megawatt generation would
 
04:13:31.070 --> 04:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
that multiply quintupled
 
04:13:34.010 --> 04:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh no because that would just be um in
 
04:13:35.269 --> 04:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
04:13:37.010 --> 04:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
um generation when quintuple that
 
04:13:38.570 --> 04:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
because that's those are all the wrecks
 
04:13:40.729 --> 04:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
and the RPS compliance outside of net
 
04:13:42.769 --> 04:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
metering so that is everything including
 
04:13:44.689 --> 04:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
biomass small scale Hydro things like
 
04:13:46.790 --> 04:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
that that are may not necessarily be net
 
04:13:46.800 --> 04:13:50.389 align:start position:0%
that that are may not necessarily be net
metered

04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
yeah speaking of thank you Mr chair and
 
04:13:57.530 --> 04:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh uh speaking of costs is there any uh
 
04:14:00.050 --> 04:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
calculation ever made of uh the cost
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
savings produced by the renewable energy
 
04:14:05.330 --> 04:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh program and and it's uh you know
 
04:14:08.030 --> 04:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
Allied uh end uses is there any
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
calculation made of the demand side
 
04:14:09.840 --> 04:14:11.210 align:start position:0%
calculation made of the demand side
savings

04:14:11.210 --> 04:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
savings
 
04:14:14.210 --> 04:14:14.220 align:start position:0%
so the only way we would be able to
 
04:14:17.290 --> 04:14:17.300 align:start position:0%
quantify that would be through
 
04:14:20.330 --> 04:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
the programs I guess that we have sort
 
04:14:21.769 --> 04:14:21.779 align:start position:0%
of the the development that has been
 
04:14:24.349 --> 04:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
incented through these those acps
 
04:14:25.849 --> 04:14:25.859 align:start position:0%
um that would be the only firm number
 
04:14:27.530 --> 04:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
that I could think of off the top of my
 
04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
head because we wouldn't necessarily
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
know okay are those you know renewable
 
04:14:33.170 --> 04:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
sources are they cited somewhere else
 
04:14:35.090 --> 04:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
would they have occurred otherwise you
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
know would they have occurred only
 
04:14:37.610 --> 04:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
because of this program would that money
 
04:14:39.849 --> 04:14:39.859 align:start position:0%
have gone somewhere else and so there's
 
04:14:42.410 --> 04:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
I suppose it would probably require a
 
04:14:44.570 --> 04:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
larger economic analysis rather than
 
04:14:47.150 --> 04:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
what I have at my fingertips follow up
 
04:14:48.650 --> 04:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up question thank you Mr
 
04:14:48.660 --> 04:14:49.550 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up question thank you Mr
chair

04:14:49.550 --> 04:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
um is the what is the budget for the
 
04:14:54.170 --> 04:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
acp's uh year by year is that bit going
 
04:14:56.570 --> 04:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
up or is that it it varies um I was
 
04:14:58.610 --> 04:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
going to say is there a slide in here no
 
04:14:59.809 --> 04:14:59.819 align:start position:0%
there's not
 
04:15:01.790 --> 04:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
um it varies from year to year so it
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
largely depends on what the larger Rec
 
04:15:06.530 --> 04:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
Market is doing for example other states
 
04:15:08.689 --> 04:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
have uh different policies that will
 
04:15:11.330 --> 04:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
impact what does and doesn't count
 
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
um for their um
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh for their wreck so unfortunately a
 
04:15:17.210 --> 04:15:17.220 align:start position:0%
class one in New Hampshire isn't the
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
same as a class one in Massachusetts or
 
04:15:20.510 --> 04:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
Connecticut or Rhode Island
 
04:15:22.250 --> 04:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
um that it varies and different ones
 
04:15:24.349 --> 04:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
have different eligibility for example
 
04:15:26.330 --> 04:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
recently Massachusetts has decided that
 
04:15:27.950 --> 04:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
they're not going to consider biomass as
 
04:15:30.050 --> 04:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
a renewable energy resource anymore so
 
04:15:31.910 --> 04:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's not eligible to
 
04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
um those wrecks won't be eligible to
 
04:15:36.110 --> 04:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
meet Massachusetts as RPS compliance so
 
04:15:37.490 --> 04:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
you imagine all of those wrecks have to
 
04:15:38.990 --> 04:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
flow somewhere else the price is
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
probably going to drop there'll be more
 
04:15:42.650 --> 04:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
of them available so the sort of all of
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
those outside market dynamics no matter
 
04:15:48.170 --> 04:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
what we do what we we could do something
 
04:15:49.429 --> 04:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire another state
 
04:15:50.689 --> 04:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
could do something else and it would
 
04:15:56.050 --> 04:15:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:59.689 --> 04:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
04:16:01.010 --> 04:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
um thank you I was writing down my
 
04:16:03.050 --> 04:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
question was representative Summers was
 
04:16:04.370 --> 04:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
asking his so I think it may have been
 
04:16:06.830 --> 04:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
the same one but I missed it so
 
04:16:09.290 --> 04:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
um do you have like a chart or something
 
04:16:11.689 --> 04:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
a rundown of how much the biomass
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
program I'm sorry biomass RPS program
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
um cost to run including salaries
 
04:16:19.490 --> 04:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
overhead all that and then compare it to
 
04:16:23.150 --> 04:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
I guess it would depend on how you Quant
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
so we have financial data yeah so we
 
04:16:28.490 --> 04:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
produce an annual report every year that
 
04:16:31.309 --> 04:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
shows how much we got in ACP Revenue
 
04:16:34.490 --> 04:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
where it came from who paid it and then
 
04:16:36.590 --> 04:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
we also show the opposite side of you
 
04:16:37.849 --> 04:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
know what it went out what I went to go
 
04:16:39.410 --> 04:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
pay for staff and salaries what it went
 
04:16:41.750 --> 04:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
out to go for all these rebate programs
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
that I just mentioned
 
04:16:46.010 --> 04:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
um as far as sort of a larger economic
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
analysis I am not aware of one has been
 
04:16:50.210 --> 04:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
done to say okay does the cost benefit
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
you know that economic analysis that
 
04:16:53.990 --> 04:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're looking for I'm not aware of one
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
that has been done I'd be happy to stand
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:02.150 --> 04:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up well this is a different
 
04:17:02.160 --> 04:17:03.050 align:start position:0%
follow-up well this is a different
question

04:17:03.050 --> 04:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:17:04.969 --> 04:17:04.979 align:start position:0%
um do you know why Massachusetts dropped
 
04:17:06.410 --> 04:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
biomass from
 
04:17:06.420 --> 04:17:08.269 align:start position:0%
biomass from
consideration

04:17:08.269 --> 04:17:08.279 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
04:17:10.729 --> 04:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
um I would I it would be conjecture on
 
04:17:12.290 --> 04:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
my part I think there is a certain
 
04:17:14.330 --> 04:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
school of thought
 
04:17:17.170 --> 04:17:17.180 align:start position:0%
um within sort of um
 
04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
how to put it environmental circles as
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
to whether or not biomass is truly a
 
04:17:23.870 --> 04:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
renewable resource because it still
 
04:17:25.849 --> 04:17:25.859 align:start position:0%
emits carbon dioxide
 
04:17:27.650 --> 04:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
I think that's I think that's the Crux
 
04:17:31.250 --> 04:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
of it so rather than you know uh um a
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric Dam or solar or Winder etc
 
04:17:36.290 --> 04:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
etc that biomass is still emitting
 
04:17:39.950 --> 04:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.570 --> 04:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not taking a position on that I'm
 
04:17:43.550 --> 04:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
just assuming that's what what somebody
 
04:17:48.050 --> 04:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:50.450 --> 04:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
continue please
 
04:17:52.729 --> 04:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
um so here's uh here's a breakdown of
 
04:17:55.010 --> 04:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
the um what we've outlaid since
 
04:17:58.729 --> 04:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
Inception of the uh of the various RFP
 
04:18:01.250 --> 04:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
or excuse me ref program rebates
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
um so you can see the number of solar
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
residential solar hot water uh
 
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
residential wood pellet cni solar as
 
04:18:10.790 --> 04:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
well as cni wood pellet programs as well
 
04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
as the
 
04:18:13.969 --> 04:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
um you can see in the second to last
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
columns the aggregate applicant
 
04:18:17.809 --> 04:18:17.819 align:start position:0%
Investments so we see how much the the
 
04:18:19.010 --> 04:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
state has put in how much other
 
04:18:21.410 --> 04:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
investment that has drawn
 
04:18:23.750 --> 04:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
um again there's the economic analysis
 
04:18:25.550 --> 04:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
of that's very basic economic analysis
 
04:18:26.990 --> 04:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
but in terms of okay would that
 
04:18:28.610 --> 04:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
development have happened otherwise it's
 
04:18:30.110 --> 04:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
sort of it's hard to say without an
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
actual economic analysis the very last
 
04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
column um you do have the
 
04:18:38.210 --> 04:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
um total number of generation that has
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
been brought online that is at least in
 
04:18:44.809 --> 04:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
part attributable to these programs
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
next slide um this is just an overview
 
04:18:49.250 --> 04:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
of the competitive grant program
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
um so for example there's a couple of of
 
04:18:53.150 --> 04:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
examples on the right hand side there
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
Fountain Fall Mountain excuse me
 
04:18:57.290 --> 04:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
Regional School Districts for wood
 
04:18:58.849 --> 04:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
pellet boilers
 
04:19:00.229 --> 04:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
um uh as well as a couple of other
 
04:19:01.849 --> 04:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
different school districts Plymouth
 
04:19:04.250 --> 04:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility as well as
 
04:19:06.170 --> 04:19:06.180 align:start position:0%
a high mowing school and again I
 
04:19:09.849 --> 04:19:09.859 align:start position:0%
mentioned Orris which is a
 
04:19:12.849 --> 04:19:12.859 align:start position:0%
program that benefits
 
04:19:15.229 --> 04:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
immigrants new immigrants to the United
 
04:19:18.309 --> 04:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
States especially in in we're working on
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
working in the agricultural sector like
 
04:19:21.769 --> 04:19:21.779 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get their own Farms up
 
04:19:25.010 --> 04:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
and going that's the latest one of the
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me I'm sorry I'm mixing
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
programs this is a competitive program
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:19:31.849 --> 04:19:31.859 align:start position:0%
um some of the latest ones have actually
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
been upgrading hydroelectric facilities
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh there's one out in Dover I believe
 
04:19:36.650 --> 04:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
there's a couple around the state of
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
where they're uh you know either
 
04:19:39.650 --> 04:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
bringing them back up online replacing
 
04:19:41.269 --> 04:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
Valves and things like that to make them
 
04:19:41.279 --> 04:19:42.290 align:start position:0%
Valves and things like that to make them
actually

04:19:42.290 --> 04:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:19:44.090 --> 04:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
um eligible
 
04:19:44.100 --> 04:19:44.870 align:start position:0%
um eligible
um

04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:46.729 --> 04:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
to generate racks and that's sort of the
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
underlying premise behind the the uh the
 
04:19:51.950 --> 04:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
ref and how it funds programs in theory
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
it should be incenting additional
 
04:19:56.030 --> 04:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
development of renewable energy
 
04:19:58.189 --> 04:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
resources which then creates more
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates which in
 
04:20:02.090 --> 04:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
theory makes more available drives down
 
04:20:04.610 --> 04:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
the price reduces the need for ACP So in
 
04:20:06.650 --> 04:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
theory it should be a self-fulfilling
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
cycle that goes further and further and
 
04:20:09.469 --> 04:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
essentially Works itself out of
 
04:20:11.389 --> 04:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
existence because at some point no acps
 
04:20:13.250 --> 04:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
would be needed because you'd be able to
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
acquire all these wrecks to the open
 
04:20:14.760 --> 04:20:18.050 align:start position:0%
acquire all these wrecks to the open
market

04:20:18.050 --> 04:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
um again this is the this is a slide on
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
the LMI um competitive grant program
 
04:20:23.450 --> 04:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
um you can see the number of applicants
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
the awardees the amount of money as well
 
04:20:27.650 --> 04:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
as the number of participants um last
 
04:20:28.670 --> 04:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
year was a little bit of a tough year
 
04:20:29.929 --> 04:20:29.939 align:start position:0%
where we had two applications
 
04:20:31.429 --> 04:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately neither of them were
 
04:20:33.530 --> 04:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
eligible based on the
 
04:20:36.469 --> 04:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
um uh eligibility criteria however we
 
04:20:37.729 --> 04:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
have gone out again we've heard from a
 
04:20:39.050 --> 04:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
number of folks who are interested so
 
04:20:40.490 --> 04:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
we're hoping for to have a robust round
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
this time in terms of that program
 
04:20:45.050 --> 04:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
because that's really a program geared
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
towards folks who can't you know think
 
04:20:49.429 --> 04:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
of the LMI Community they can't afford
 
04:20:52.370 --> 04:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
the 10 15 20 000 to put a solar array on
 
04:20:54.110 --> 04:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
their roof this is a way that they can
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
benefit from from that energy transition
 
04:20:58.560 --> 04:20:59.510 align:start position:0%
benefit from from that energy transition
um

04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
so there's additional information on the
 
04:21:03.050 --> 04:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
LMI program available on our website
 
04:21:05.929 --> 04:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
that's the 2020 LMI competitive Grant
 
04:21:07.729 --> 04:21:07.739 align:start position:0%
legislative report um that Deandra had
 
04:21:09.110 --> 04:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
04:21:11.450 --> 04:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
um and as well as the 2020 LMI adder and
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
Market status
 
04:21:15.469 --> 04:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
um legislative report so with that I'm
 
04:21:19.070 --> 04:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:21.290 --> 04:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question uh
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
04:21:24.410 --> 04:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
um just looking at the numbers I see uh
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
nine total awardees for uh one and a
 
04:21:32.090 --> 04:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
half million dollars that's roughly a
 
04:21:34.849 --> 04:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars per
 
04:21:36.290 --> 04:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
um you know figuring on by energy
 
04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
consumption I could probably heat my
 
04:21:40.010 --> 04:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
house for 50 years on a hundred thousand
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
dollars this does not look like a wise
 
04:21:41.760 --> 04:21:45.050 align:start position:0%
dollars this does not look like a wise
investment

04:21:45.050 --> 04:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:48.670 --> 04:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm sorry I can't really
 
04:21:54.050 --> 04:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
formulate it as a question it's just a
 
04:21:56.269 --> 04:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
simple arithmetic
 
04:21:56.279 --> 04:21:57.229 align:start position:0%
simple arithmetic
okay

04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams has a question
 
04:22:02.809 --> 04:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that question I do
 
04:22:04.370 --> 04:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
have a separate question after this one
 
04:22:05.689 --> 04:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
but to follow up on representative
 
04:22:07.610 --> 04:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
lewicki's question can you just tell me
 
04:22:10.189 --> 04:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
of these previous awardees what type of
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
applicants they were were these like you
 
04:22:13.610 --> 04:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
know multi-family housing what are we
 
04:22:14.929 --> 04:22:14.939 align:start position:0%
looking at for people that are getting
 
04:22:18.290 --> 04:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
awarded an LMI Grant yeah so the um the
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
best actually the best example is the
 
04:22:21.050 --> 04:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
one that I know the best
 
04:22:22.610 --> 04:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
um is that the most recent one that I
 
04:22:24.050 --> 04:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
mentioned in Dunbarton so it's an
 
04:22:26.269 --> 04:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
organization that works with
 
04:22:26.279 --> 04:22:26.809 align:start position:0%
organization that works with
um

04:22:26.809 --> 04:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:28.370 --> 04:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
recent immigrants to the country who are
 
04:22:29.689 --> 04:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
looking to get into the agricultural
 
04:22:32.809 --> 04:22:32.819 align:start position:0%
sector so they have uh land available in
 
04:22:35.090 --> 04:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton that they've been able to put
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
up a solar array and then those the
 
04:22:40.010 --> 04:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
benefits of that solar array
 
04:22:42.050 --> 04:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
um so the reduction in electricity costs
 
04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
then go directly to anybody who is LMI
 
04:22:46.849 --> 04:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
so that would be really depending on how
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
you uh the the m is a bit difficult to
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
the the middle income is a bit difficult
 
04:22:52.790 --> 04:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
to actually get Target the benefits to
 
04:22:55.250 --> 04:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
but low income is much easier because
 
04:22:57.229 --> 04:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
there's other benef similar programs if
 
04:22:58.370 --> 04:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
you're eligible for other sort of
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
assistance programs it's easy to say
 
04:23:01.490 --> 04:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
you're eligible for this but the
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
benefits of those solar arrays and that
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
energy generation goes to reduce if not
 
04:23:08.030 --> 04:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
eliminate the electric bills for those
 
04:23:08.040 --> 04:23:09.410 align:start position:0%
eliminate the electric bills for those
participants

04:23:09.410 --> 04:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
participants
 
04:23:11.450 --> 04:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
um so just going back a little bit when
 
04:23:15.410 --> 04:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
we talked about the competitive grant
 
04:23:17.689 --> 04:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
program and you've got a this is slide
 
04:23:19.849 --> 04:23:19.859 align:start position:0%
53 you've got a list of a bunch of
 
04:23:22.670 --> 04:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
different looks like schools
 
04:23:24.910 --> 04:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
Fall Mountain Regional School District
 
04:23:27.889 --> 04:23:27.899 align:start position:0%
historic Harrisville holderness School
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
there's Plymouth wastewater treatment
 
04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
plant and high mowing school
 
04:23:34.250 --> 04:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like some of these are
 
04:23:37.070 --> 04:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
public entities that are receiving a
 
04:23:39.769 --> 04:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
grant would that be accurate yes so yes
 
04:23:42.410 --> 04:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
school districts towns any sort of
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
component of of local government are are
 
04:23:47.090 --> 04:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
they are considered commercial based on
 
04:23:48.530 --> 04:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
their meter and how much electricity
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're using they're considered usually
 
04:23:52.370 --> 04:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
commercial customers so they're eligible
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
for this grant program follow up
 
04:23:59.689 --> 04:23:59.699 align:start position:0%
follow up so for these public
 
04:24:01.610 --> 04:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
brand recipients
 
04:24:03.769 --> 04:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
is part of their calculus for
 
04:24:05.090 --> 04:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not they're going
 
04:24:08.389 --> 04:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
to do the project do they consider the
 
04:24:10.429 --> 04:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
value of the Rex when they choose to do
 
04:24:13.010 --> 04:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
this for a municipal project for example
 
04:24:15.410 --> 04:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
yes I don't want to speak for every
 
04:24:18.050 --> 04:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
single entity but yes that goes into the
 
04:24:19.790 --> 04:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
financial calculation I imagine for some
 
04:24:22.010 --> 04:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
if they decide not to retain the racks
 
04:24:22.020 --> 04:24:23.389 align:start position:0%
if they decide not to retain the racks
themselves

04:24:23.389 --> 04:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:24:28.729 --> 04:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:31.130 --> 04:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we
 
04:24:33.410 --> 04:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for that portion of the
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
presentation welcome looks like we're
 
04:24:37.550 --> 04:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
going to move on now and here once again
 
04:24:37.560 --> 04:24:38.630 align:start position:0%
going to move on now and here once again
from

04:24:38.630 --> 04:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:46.790 --> 04:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
welcome again
 
04:24:49.370 --> 04:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon everybody
 
04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
um it's a pleasure to be here today and
 
04:24:53.330 --> 04:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
as Tom said earlier see some familiar
 
04:24:57.469 --> 04:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
faces and meet some new faces so
 
04:24:57.479 --> 04:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
faces and meet some new faces so
um

04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:01.969 --> 04:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
as Josh had mentioned earlier the
 
04:25:03.769 --> 04:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
department oversees a number of
 
04:25:06.530 --> 04:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
different programs which I'm sorry
 
04:25:09.769 --> 04:25:09.779 align:start position:0%
that's okay which provides services to
 
04:25:11.450 --> 04:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
Consumers throughout the state through
 
04:25:13.370 --> 04:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
res for these are primarily residential
 
04:25:13.380 --> 04:25:15.170 align:start position:0%
res for these are primarily residential
consumers

04:25:15.170 --> 04:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
um Josh had mentioned a low-income home
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
energy assistance program or what we
 
04:25:21.650 --> 04:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
call fap fuel assistance program in New
 
04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's a federally funded
 
04:25:26.269 --> 04:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
program through the U.S Department of
 
04:25:28.550 --> 04:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and the state
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
receives a block grant each year to
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
provide assistance to low-income
 
04:25:36.170 --> 04:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
households within the state the income
 
04:25:39.710 --> 04:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
eligibility level is 60 of the state
 
04:25:42.290 --> 04:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
median income in New Hampshire and
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's a chart that shows you for your
 
04:25:47.389 --> 04:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
household size what that upper income
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
limit is
 
04:25:51.050 --> 04:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
for the current program year that we're
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
in right now the state received close to
 
04:25:57.290 --> 04:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
34 million dollars in a block grant for
 
04:25:59.870 --> 04:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance for customers within the
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
state as was mentioned earlier
 
04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
application eligibility determination
 
04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
and benefit determination is all done by
 
04:26:09.889 --> 04:26:09.899 align:start position:0%
the Community Action agencies there are
 
04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
five Community Action agencies
 
04:26:13.790 --> 04:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
regionally within the state covering
 
04:26:16.250 --> 04:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
either one or two counties or in the
 
04:26:19.370 --> 04:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
case of Tri-County Three Counties so
 
04:26:22.309 --> 04:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
they they provide services in five
 
04:26:24.649 --> 04:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
distinct Geographic areas throughout the
 
04:26:27.110 --> 04:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire customers go in
 
04:26:29.090 --> 04:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
there kind of One-Stop shopping they
 
04:26:31.610 --> 04:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
fill out one application and the
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
Community Action agencies determine
 
04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
which programs they would be eligible
 
04:26:38.750 --> 04:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
for and what that that benefit amount
 
04:26:40.429 --> 04:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:26:42.530 --> 04:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
for fuel assistance
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
the the benefit determination is
 
04:26:48.170 --> 04:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
targeted to households with the lowest
 
04:26:50.990 --> 04:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
incomes and the highest energy costs so
 
04:26:53.330 --> 04:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
we'll look at things such as household
 
04:26:56.330 --> 04:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
income but also your energy type and the
 
04:26:59.570 --> 04:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
cost of that energy the degree days how
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
cold it is within the region that you're
 
04:27:05.689 --> 04:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
located in your housing type and so
 
04:27:07.849 --> 04:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
forth to determine the benefit
 
04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
the benefit range for this program year
 
04:27:13.610 --> 04:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
is between three hundred dollars and
 
04:27:15.290 --> 04:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
just a little over three thousand
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
dollars and the average we'll see at the
 
04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
end of the program year what the average
 
04:27:22.370 --> 04:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
benefit to consumers in the state
 
04:27:24.110 --> 04:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
actually is
 
04:27:26.750 --> 04:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
the program's been open for eight weeks
 
04:27:29.570 --> 04:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
now typically opens on December 1st of
 
04:27:32.210 --> 04:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
each year given the high energy costs
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
the volatility and the energy markets
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
the department opened the program on
 
04:27:38.689 --> 04:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
November 1st this year so a little more
 
04:27:40.370 --> 04:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
than eight weeks but when I looked at
 
04:27:42.429 --> 04:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
statistics that we were eight weeks in
 
04:27:45.710 --> 04:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
and what we've seen this year is a
 
04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
considerably higher volume of
 
04:27:51.410 --> 04:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
applications and appointments at the
 
04:27:53.570 --> 04:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
community action agencies than in past
 
04:27:57.229 --> 04:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
years for example week eight this year
 
04:28:00.410 --> 04:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
versus week eight last year there were
 
04:28:02.689 --> 04:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
more 3 000 more applications had been
 
04:28:04.670 --> 04:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
received this year than for the same
 
04:28:06.849 --> 04:28:06.859 align:start position:0%
time period last year
 
04:28:09.070 --> 04:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
appointments were up
 
04:28:12.830 --> 04:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
5100 more appointments week eight this
 
04:28:15.830 --> 04:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
year versus week eight last year so the
 
04:28:19.130 --> 04:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
need and the interest is out there and
 
04:28:19.140 --> 04:28:20.389 align:start position:0%
need and the interest is out there and
the

04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:20.399 --> 04:28:21.110 align:start position:0%
the
um

04:28:21.110 --> 04:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:23.210 --> 04:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
Community Action agencies are doing the
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:31.910 --> 04:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
quick highlights from last year the
 
04:28:34.130 --> 04:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
state received about 28 million dollars
 
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
in the regular lie Heap block grant so
 
04:28:40.429 --> 04:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
we received more in the block grant this
 
04:28:43.070 --> 04:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
year than we did last year there were
 
04:28:45.410 --> 04:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
some error funds received last year 35
 
04:28:47.570 --> 04:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars received last
 
04:28:47.580 --> 04:28:48.670 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars received last
year

04:28:48.670 --> 04:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:28:51.490 --> 04:28:51.500 align:start position:0%
25 well 24
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
400 or so households received benefits
 
04:28:57.110 --> 04:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
the average benefit was in the Thirteen
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar range
 
04:29:02.809 --> 04:29:02.819 align:start position:0%
as part of last year's program for the
 
04:29:05.570 --> 04:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
first time in part due to the arpa funds
 
04:29:08.510 --> 04:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
that were available a one-time cooling
 
04:29:10.790 --> 04:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
credit was provided on electric bills
 
04:29:13.610 --> 04:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
for customers who had been enrolled and
 
04:29:15.710 --> 04:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
received a benefit in the fuel
 
04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
assistance program so they received some
 
04:29:20.450 --> 04:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
help on their electric bill this summer
 
04:29:23.809 --> 04:29:23.819 align:start position:0%
to help cover cooling costs during the
 
04:29:27.889 --> 04:29:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
the weatherization assistance program is
 
04:29:32.929 --> 04:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
another federally funded program through
 
04:29:35.450 --> 04:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
the U.S department of energy and it
 
04:29:38.330 --> 04:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
provides weatherization services to
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
low-income households in the state
 
04:29:43.130 --> 04:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
focusing on those most vulnerable to
 
04:29:46.189 --> 04:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
high energy costs and without the means
 
04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
to make the cost-effective improvements
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
on their own
 
04:29:54.410 --> 04:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
um there the funding for this is in this
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
year 1.9 million dollars was received at
 
04:29:59.090 --> 04:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
the beginning of July for the program
 
04:30:03.170 --> 04:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
year that will run through June 30 2023.
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
um we anticipate or well we don't
 
04:30:07.370 --> 04:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
anticipate we've received additional
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
funding through the bipartisan
 
04:30:12.349 --> 04:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law which
 
04:30:15.189 --> 04:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
will over the course of five years
 
04:30:19.130 --> 04:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
ending June 30th 2027 provide New
 
04:30:21.170 --> 04:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with an additional 18 million
 
04:30:23.090 --> 04:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
in weatherization assistance program
 
04:30:27.170 --> 04:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
funds that yes representative Thomas has
 
04:30:28.189 --> 04:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:30:32.330 --> 04:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh just uh as
 
04:30:34.610 --> 04:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
examples what types of weatherization
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
programs do you sure uh qualify or uh
 
04:30:40.210 --> 04:30:40.220 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:30:42.830 --> 04:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
doors windows
 
04:30:45.950 --> 04:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
um you know addicts you know uh things
 
04:30:48.290 --> 04:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
like that yeah absolutely so when a
 
04:30:49.550 --> 04:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
customer applies and they're found
 
04:30:52.490 --> 04:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
eligible and energy auditor goes out and
 
04:30:55.309 --> 04:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
does an energy audit of their home
 
04:30:58.250 --> 04:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
and they identify all the things that
 
04:30:59.929 --> 04:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
can be done for Energy Efficiency
 
04:31:02.570 --> 04:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
improvements and then they prioritize
 
04:31:05.149 --> 04:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
those based on the ones where they're
 
04:31:06.769 --> 04:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
going to get the most bang for the buck
 
04:31:08.469 --> 04:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
so to speak because
 
04:31:10.849 --> 04:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
04:31:15.290 --> 04:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
average cost per unit cap Statewide so
 
04:31:16.969 --> 04:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
when we're done at the end of this
 
04:31:19.010 --> 04:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
program year the average cost of
 
04:31:20.990 --> 04:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
weatherization Services provided
 
04:31:21.000 --> 04:31:23.389 align:start position:0%
weatherization Services provided
Statewide

04:31:23.389 --> 04:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
04:31:25.849 --> 04:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
is a little over eight thousand dollars
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's eight thousand and seven or
 
04:31:30.070 --> 04:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
nine dollars
 
04:31:33.410 --> 04:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
and so the energy auditor will identify
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
the most critical ones to do that will
 
04:31:39.469 --> 04:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
yield the most savings and it would
 
04:31:42.309 --> 04:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
include things like attic air ceiling
 
04:31:44.750 --> 04:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
attic insulation if there's no
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
insulation wall insulation if there's no
 
04:31:51.170 --> 04:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
insulation air sealing insulation of
 
04:31:55.309 --> 04:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
basements crawl spaces it could include
 
04:31:57.530 --> 04:31:57.540 align:start position:0%
the replacement of a door if the door is
 
04:31:57.540 --> 04:31:58.630 align:start position:0%
the replacement of a door if the door is
very

04:31:58.630 --> 04:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
drafty and ill-fitting but it would be
 
04:32:05.809 --> 04:32:05.819 align:start position:0%
specific to each individual applicant's
 
04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
circumstances and what the energy audit
 
04:32:09.950 --> 04:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
finds to be the most important
 
04:32:11.389 --> 04:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
improvements or the most effective
 
04:32:12.950 --> 04:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
improvements to make
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
I just follow up follow-up uh thank you
 
04:32:18.170 --> 04:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
04:32:20.689 --> 04:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
I know I had a constituent that had used
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:29.689 --> 04:32:29.699 align:start position:0%
he actually had to put blankets over his
 
04:32:31.490 --> 04:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
windows to keep the snow from coming in
 
04:32:33.830 --> 04:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
there it was in that better shape yet
 
04:32:36.530 --> 04:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
when he had the energy audit done the
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
windows were did not qualify to get
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
assistance from that so I was just
 
04:32:43.010 --> 04:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
wondering if there was a limit or uh or
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
or do you have to go back and reapply
 
04:32:46.910 --> 04:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
again to get more work done how does
 
04:32:49.010 --> 04:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
that work
 
04:32:51.889 --> 04:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
um so we're I believe you can reapply
 
04:32:54.110 --> 04:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
for weatherization services but there's
 
04:32:56.750 --> 04:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
a time limit in between receipt of that
 
04:32:56.760 --> 04:32:57.830 align:start position:0%
a time limit in between receipt of that
benefit

04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
04:33:00.530 --> 04:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to why in his particular
 
04:33:03.290 --> 04:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
circumstance work wasn't done on his
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
windows without
 
04:33:07.570 --> 04:33:07.580 align:start position:0%
having our weatherization
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
assistance program director look at the
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
audit and what work was done and what
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know whether there were bigger
 
04:33:15.949 --> 04:33:15.959 align:start position:0%
issues that were addressed within the
 
04:33:18.170 --> 04:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
limited spending that they had for that
 
04:33:18.180 --> 04:33:19.330 align:start position:0%
limited spending that they had for that
particular

04:33:19.330 --> 04:33:19.340 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:33:23.209 --> 04:33:23.219 align:start position:0%
individual okay thank you representative
 
04:33:25.310 --> 04:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
Nutter has a question
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is actually
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
on the fuel assistance because I got it
 
04:33:32.449 --> 04:33:32.459 align:start position:0%
a message just today from um the
 
04:33:34.670 --> 04:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
constituent she said no word on my
 
04:33:36.470 --> 04:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
application for the fuel assistance I
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
bet I don't get it I did apply you said
 
04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
three you had three thousand more
 
04:33:43.369 --> 04:33:43.379 align:start position:0%
applicants so do you respond to every
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
applicant or just the ones who are
 
04:33:47.570 --> 04:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
granted assistance so the Community
 
04:33:49.929 --> 04:33:49.939 align:start position:0%
Action agencies take the applications
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
and do the certification to determine if
 
04:33:55.070 --> 04:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
someone is eligible or not and they
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
communicate that to every single person
 
04:34:00.170 --> 04:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
who's applied whether they're eligible
 
04:34:03.170 --> 04:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
whether they're not eligible whether
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
they fail to complete their application
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:12.529 --> 04:34:12.539 align:start position:0%
the Community Action agencies are
 
04:34:14.090 --> 04:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
resource constrained like many
 
04:34:16.070 --> 04:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
non-profit businesses or small
 
04:34:17.929 --> 04:34:17.939 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state they struggle
 
04:34:19.970 --> 04:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
with the low unemployment rate and
 
04:34:23.570 --> 04:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
keeping and maintaining staff so they
 
04:34:25.789 --> 04:34:25.799 align:start position:0%
work as best they can with the staff
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
that they have and do a great job taking
 
04:34:31.070 --> 04:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
care of folks as they come in but there
 
04:34:33.289 --> 04:34:33.299 align:start position:0%
is a bit of a backlog in the
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
applications certainly folks can call
 
04:34:37.849 --> 04:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy you could refer
 
04:34:41.631 --> 04:34:41.641 align:start position:0%
that customer over to us and we'd reach
 
04:34:43.970 --> 04:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
out to the cap and say where is this can
 
04:34:46.369 --> 04:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
you unstick this or you know figure out
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
04:34:48.240 --> 04:34:51.070 align:start position:0%
what's going on
foreign

04:34:51.070 --> 04:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
what is the number just so I could
 
04:34:56.269 --> 04:34:56.279 align:start position:0%
oh for the Department of energy yes
 
04:34:58.010 --> 04:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
um it's in our slides somewhere our main
 
04:34:59.529 --> 04:34:59.539 align:start position:0%
number is
 
04:35:02.810 --> 04:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
271-3670 and the 800 number is
 
04:35:02.820 --> 04:35:07.010 align:start position:0%
271-3670 and the 800 number is
800-852-3793

04:35:07.010 --> 04:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you slide 67.
 
04:35:13.131 --> 04:35:13.141 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering how many do you uh
 
04:35:18.769 --> 04:35:18.779 align:start position:0%
use independent private contractors to
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
do this weatherization work or do you
 
04:35:22.849 --> 04:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
have your own staff and how many people
 
04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
do you employ or how many businesses are
 
04:35:26.449 --> 04:35:26.459 align:start position:0%
involved in this program
 
04:35:30.051 --> 04:35:30.061 align:start position:0%
sure sure uh Josh Elliott division
 
04:35:30.061 --> 04:35:31.010 align:start position:0%
sure sure uh Josh Elliott division
director

04:35:31.010 --> 04:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
director
 
04:35:32.810 --> 04:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
um so it depends on the area so for
 
04:35:34.910 --> 04:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
example Tri-County has their own staff
 
04:35:36.590 --> 04:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
and their own Crews that go out to
 
04:35:38.869 --> 04:35:38.879 align:start position:0%
actually perform the weatherization work
 
04:35:40.369 --> 04:35:40.379 align:start position:0%
um as far as I'm aware I believe they're
 
04:35:42.890 --> 04:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
the only one that has adopted that model
 
04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
um the other for the balance of the
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
state um they go out with private
 
04:35:49.250 --> 04:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
contractors to do this work so they'll
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
do what's called a pre-qualified list
 
04:35:52.730 --> 04:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
essentially rather than going out for an
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
RFP or um
 
04:35:58.131 --> 04:35:58.141 align:start position:0%
or have to respond for uh you know put
 
04:35:59.631 --> 04:35:59.641 align:start position:0%
out to bid every single last project
 
04:36:02.990 --> 04:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
they'll get a um a group of contractors
 
04:36:04.670 --> 04:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
who meet the qualifications and then as
 
04:36:06.470 --> 04:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
each job comes up they'll sort of parcel
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
them out
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
um one by one one youth contractor but I
 
04:36:11.929 --> 04:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
will say um this is uh certainly an area
 
04:36:13.250 --> 04:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
if you know of any contractors are
 
04:36:14.330 --> 04:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
interested in getting into this work
 
04:36:17.529 --> 04:36:17.539 align:start position:0%
there's always demand for them
 
04:36:20.750 --> 04:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
04:36:23.631 --> 04:36:23.641 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm wondering are any
 
04:36:25.131 --> 04:36:25.141 align:start position:0%
measurements done in terms of the
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
weatherization uh do you uh determine uh
 
04:36:32.209 --> 04:36:32.219 align:start position:0%
the Savings in in terms of uh air
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:39.349 --> 04:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
raw throughout the weatherization yeah
 
04:36:41.449 --> 04:36:41.459 align:start position:0%
per unit so you know you can actually
 
04:36:44.029 --> 04:36:44.039 align:start position:0%
measure with blower door tests what the
 
04:36:45.890 --> 04:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
what the overall effect is and from that
 
04:36:49.490 --> 04:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
extrapolate actual dollar savings
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
so there's two versions to the low
 
04:36:54.650 --> 04:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
income weatherization assistance program
 
04:36:56.631 --> 04:36:56.641 align:start position:0%
there's a federally funded piece and
 
04:36:58.490 --> 04:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
then there's the piece that's funded
 
04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
through the Electric and Gas Utilities
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs and I believe
 
04:37:06.949 --> 04:37:06.959 align:start position:0%
the answer is the same for both which is
 
04:37:08.929 --> 04:37:08.939 align:start position:0%
when the work is done there is another
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
blower door test done to measure the
 
04:37:13.970 --> 04:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
efficiency improvements and then that
 
04:37:16.189 --> 04:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
could in turn calculate savings and
 
04:37:18.709 --> 04:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
payback for the customer and that's I
 
04:37:21.849 --> 04:37:21.859 align:start position:0%
believe part of the whole audit process
 
04:37:23.810 --> 04:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
particularly for someone that's making
 
04:37:25.369 --> 04:37:25.379 align:start position:0%
their own investment to let them know
 
04:37:27.769 --> 04:37:27.779 align:start position:0%
what the payback period would be thank
 
04:37:27.779 --> 04:37:28.750 align:start position:0%
what the payback period would be thank
you

04:37:28.750 --> 04:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:37:31.730 --> 04:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
04:37:34.849 --> 04:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman the the block grants
 
04:37:36.109 --> 04:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
that come from the federal government
 
04:37:39.410 --> 04:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
are those specific Are there specific
 
04:37:41.810 --> 04:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
requirements that they be used for fuel
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
assistance and weather
 
04:37:46.369 --> 04:37:46.379 align:start position:0%
um weather weatherization programs or is
 
04:37:49.849 --> 04:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
is is that how we the state have chosen
 
04:37:51.470 --> 04:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
to use the money that the federal
 
04:37:54.410 --> 04:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
government has given us
 
04:37:56.929 --> 04:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
are specific to those programs and there
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
are guidelines for each from the federal
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
government and then states have some
 
04:38:03.650 --> 04:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
flexibility in customizing it within the
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
state but there are specific guidelines
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
that the federal government sets out
 
04:38:09.609 --> 04:38:09.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:12.170 --> 04:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
representative Summers
 
04:38:14.330 --> 04:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a quick question
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
this morning we've talked about
 
04:38:17.869 --> 04:38:17.879 align:start position:0%
electricity and we talked about the flow
 
04:38:19.609 --> 04:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
and how we were able to receive it and
 
04:38:21.470 --> 04:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
what the delays or the restrictions were
 
04:38:24.051 --> 04:38:24.061 align:start position:0%
on getting it as per uh and what I
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
understand about authorization how it's
 
04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
important but as far as heating oil goes
 
04:38:28.910 --> 04:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
the majority of the homes in New
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are with heating oil who's
 
04:38:32.929 --> 04:38:32.939 align:start position:0%
responsible for or who actually monitors
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
the supply and demand curve of heating
 
04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
oil how much is how much is in Supply
 
04:38:39.529 --> 04:38:39.539 align:start position:0%
how much is in demand and how it's being
 
04:38:41.570 --> 04:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
used and if we have enough to be able to
 
04:38:43.730 --> 04:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
make it through one season two seasons
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
in there
 
04:38:47.051 --> 04:38:47.061 align:start position:0%
sure yeah
 
04:38:50.631 --> 04:38:50.641 align:start position:0%
so uh the department of energy
 
04:38:52.189 --> 04:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
um participates with our other New
 
04:38:53.750 --> 04:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
England states it's called the shop
 
04:38:56.929 --> 04:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
program of where we have Regional calls
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
um with um
 
04:39:01.070 --> 04:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
other uh New England states to determine
 
04:39:02.631 --> 04:39:02.641 align:start position:0%
inventory so where that's something for
 
04:39:03.890 --> 04:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
example home eating oil right you
 
04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to figure out the last
 
04:39:06.289 --> 04:39:06.299 align:start position:0%
minute there's none left in the region
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
there are weekly calls during the winter
 
04:39:11.631 --> 04:39:11.641 align:start position:0%
heating season to determine um with uh
 
04:39:13.490 --> 04:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
with other states with regional Partners
 
04:39:15.410 --> 04:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
as well as Federal authorities figuring
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
out okay or do we have Ships coming in
 
04:39:19.310 --> 04:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
what's the inventory look like I know
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
you will probably hear from at some
 
04:39:22.250 --> 04:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
point during this
 
04:39:24.529 --> 04:39:24.539 align:start position:0%
um during this legislative session on
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
Bob Scully who is the uh runs the oil
 
04:39:28.970 --> 04:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
and propane Dealers Association although
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
I think he's handing it off a little bit
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
going a little semi-retirement um you
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
know we have frequent calls with him he
 
04:39:37.070 --> 04:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
lets us know if hey we're looking at
 
04:39:38.750 --> 04:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
supply issues here in New Hampshire Halo
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
we're looking at driver issues hey we're
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
looking at et cetera Etc
 
04:39:42.360 --> 04:39:42.948 align:start position:0%
looking at et cetera Etc
um

04:39:42.948 --> 04:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:44.510 --> 04:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
so that is something that the department
 
04:39:47.090 --> 04:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
is actively engaged in and actively
 
04:39:48.530 --> 04:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
monitoring through the winter heating
 
04:39:48.540 --> 04:39:49.910 align:start position:0%
monitoring through the winter heating
season

04:39:49.910 --> 04:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
season
 
04:39:53.208 --> 04:39:53.218 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman follow-up and so
 
04:39:55.310 --> 04:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
as as represents on this committee how
 
04:39:57.050 --> 04:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
can we or where can we find the
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
information to find where the current
 
04:40:00.530 --> 04:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
Supply is if we're running close to a
 
04:40:02.208 --> 04:40:02.218 align:start position:0%
shortage and if there's a risk being
 
04:40:04.670 --> 04:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
shortage for this winter sure so we have
 
04:40:07.130 --> 04:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
on our department of energy website we
 
04:40:09.310 --> 04:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
do um as part of that program we do
 
04:40:11.810 --> 04:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
calls around to vendors we do basically
 
04:40:13.550 --> 04:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
do a survey of vendors across the state
 
04:40:16.130 --> 04:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
of asking about different prices for
 
04:40:17.830 --> 04:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
different types of deliverable fuels
 
04:40:19.730 --> 04:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
we've also
 
04:40:19.740 --> 04:40:20.930 align:start position:0%
we've also
um

04:40:20.930 --> 04:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:22.368 --> 04:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
um we've added additional questions I
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
know there's been a discussion earlier
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
this uh year about
 
04:40:27.948 --> 04:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
um uh kerosene where there have been
 
04:40:29.810 --> 04:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
issues with kerosene that issue seems to
 
04:40:31.250 --> 04:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
have abated somewhat it's still very
 
04:40:32.630 --> 04:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
expensive but there's at least there's
 
04:40:34.430 --> 04:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
the supply there
 
04:40:36.110 --> 04:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we necessarily have
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
the exact Supply figures on our website
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
but that would be certainly if we
 
04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
um in those internal discussions you
 
04:40:43.850 --> 04:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
know with other states and whether
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders realize hey you know in a
 
04:40:46.850 --> 04:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
couple weeks we're going to have an
 
04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
issue that's certainly something we
 
04:40:49.130 --> 04:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be sitting on any information
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
we'd be communicating that to folks
 
04:40:55.250 --> 04:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I will say the best thing if uh to do
 
04:40:57.230 --> 04:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
um for con for your constituents as well
 
04:40:59.390 --> 04:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
as just anybody generally at large who's
 
04:41:01.610 --> 04:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
concerned about home heating fuels this
 
04:41:06.050 --> 04:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
winter is to be rather than a um a
 
04:41:08.630 --> 04:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
will-call customer to be a regular
 
04:41:11.330 --> 04:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
customer with a particular fuel vendor
 
04:41:13.730 --> 04:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
it helps them plan you get in their
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
system they know exactly how much fuel
 
04:41:18.410 --> 04:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
to procure they know exactly how much
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
and when you're going to need it it
 
04:41:22.368 --> 04:41:22.378 align:start position:0%
helped helps them do planning in terms
 
04:41:23.690 --> 04:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
of procurement but if you're stuck
 
04:41:25.070 --> 04:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere you know there's something you
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
said about you know bouncing from from
 
04:41:28.550 --> 04:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
place to place to get the best deal and
 
04:41:30.410 --> 04:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
the best amount for um for your home
 
04:41:30.420 --> 04:41:32.090 align:start position:0%
the best amount for um for your home
heating

04:41:32.090 --> 04:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
heating
 
04:41:34.490 --> 04:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
um but especially this this winter
 
04:41:36.288 --> 04:41:36.298 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that you're with a
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
specific supplier that you're on a
 
04:41:39.470 --> 04:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
regular cycle
 
04:41:40.850 --> 04:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
um because if you know if you're running
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
low on fuel and you're with a supplier
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
that you haven't dealt with before
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to be at the back of the
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
list versus customers that they
 
04:41:49.368 --> 04:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
regularly have so I would just encourage
 
04:41:51.948 --> 04:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
if anybody's listening to to to to do
 
04:41:53.330 --> 04:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
04:41:56.090 --> 04:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
04:41:58.910 --> 04:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative closure has a question
 
04:42:01.788 --> 04:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
yes uh director Newman
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
um going back to what what isization
 
04:42:04.080 --> 04:42:06.230 align:start position:0%
um going back to what what isization
program

04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
um is there the information that the
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
committee could have on
 
04:42:14.690 --> 04:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
um the estimated BTU savings per cost
 
04:42:16.368 --> 04:42:16.378 align:start position:0%
of the work done
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
on these applications
 
04:42:20.990 --> 04:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
sure I can I I don't know that the
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
answer to that question I'll check with
 
04:42:24.310 --> 04:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
our weatherization assistance program
 
04:42:26.868 --> 04:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
manager and see if he has that
 
04:42:28.910 --> 04:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
information available unless you know
 
04:42:31.730 --> 04:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
offhand Josh I don't but that there must
 
04:42:33.050 --> 04:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
be some Metric that we can have we can
 
04:42:35.150 --> 04:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
provide the committee yeah thank you
 
04:42:39.170 --> 04:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:40.730 --> 04:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
04:42:40.740 --> 04:42:42.110 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
uh

04:42:42.110 --> 04:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
my question is about well first I want
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
to compliment you on using the cap
 
04:42:48.170 --> 04:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
agencies as you were pass-through
 
04:42:50.330 --> 04:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
agencies seems like a genius idea in
 
04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
order to be able to get down on that
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
level in the community could you tell me
 
04:42:56.208 --> 04:42:56.218 align:start position:0%
right does New Hampshire save
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
utilize the cap programs in the same way
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
are you aware of that could you
 
04:43:05.150 --> 04:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
for their low for their low income
 
04:43:09.650 --> 04:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:11.810 --> 04:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
um for the weather so the federal
 
04:43:14.208 --> 04:43:14.218 align:start position:0%
weatherization program coordinates
 
04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
closely with the utilities for their
 
04:43:18.050 --> 04:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
home energy assistance program which is
 
04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
for low-income customers and the
 
04:43:22.430 --> 04:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
Community Action agencies are the driver
 
04:43:24.050 --> 04:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
for the application and eligibility
 
04:43:26.350 --> 04:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
determination for both those programs
 
04:43:29.690 --> 04:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
the utilities May
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
they're not experts in low income so if
 
04:43:33.948 --> 04:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
you were to call them they would tell
 
04:43:35.810 --> 04:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
you they can't determine your income
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
eligibility they don't know how to do it
 
04:43:39.350 --> 04:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
and they would send you to the cap who
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
could but essentially they're both being
 
04:43:44.150 --> 04:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
administered in the same fashion so
 
04:43:46.430 --> 04:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
there's no chance of redundancy of
 
04:43:50.330 --> 04:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
both Services correct thank you
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
I would remind members that
 
04:43:57.050 --> 04:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
when you want to speak to the committee
 
04:43:58.970 --> 04:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
you have to get the permission of the
 
04:44:01.490 --> 04:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
chair so please uh let me know if you
 
04:44:04.610 --> 04:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
want to say something additional
 
04:44:06.050 --> 04:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we're done with
 
04:44:07.850 --> 04:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
questions there you can continue on with
 
04:44:09.530 --> 04:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
your presentation thank you
 
04:44:09.540 --> 04:44:10.850 align:start position:0%
your presentation thank you
okay

04:44:10.850 --> 04:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:44:10.860 --> 04:44:11.930 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:44:11.930 --> 04:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:14.810 --> 04:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
so this is just a quick recap of the
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance program year
 
04:44:18.890 --> 04:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
that ended
 
04:44:21.650 --> 04:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
well note that that's in process right
 
04:44:25.250 --> 04:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
now so it runs from July 1 2022 through
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
June 30 2023.
 
04:44:30.948 --> 04:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
um It's On Target to provide benefits to
 
04:44:34.730 --> 04:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
approximately 150 to 160 homes I
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned the close coordination with
 
04:44:38.090 --> 04:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
the utility home energy assistance
 
04:44:40.910 --> 04:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
program as part of New Hampshire saves
 
04:44:42.590 --> 04:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
in the Energy Efficiency resource
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
standard so in total we anticipate
 
04:44:46.080 --> 04:44:47.030 align:start position:0%
standard so in total we anticipate
um

04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:49.970 --> 04:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
A Thousand Eleven Hundred homes would
 
04:44:51.948 --> 04:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
benefit from weatherization assistance
 
04:44:59.170 --> 04:44:59.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:02.030 --> 04:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
the electric assistance program is a
 
04:45:03.890 --> 04:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
state-funded program not a federally
 
04:45:05.930 --> 04:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
funded program it's funded through a
 
04:45:07.970 --> 04:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
charge on customers electric bills
 
04:45:10.910 --> 04:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
through the system benefits charge it is
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
legislatively capped at 1.5 mils per
 
04:45:16.368 --> 04:45:16.378 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour for the average customer
 
04:45:21.050 --> 04:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
using 625 kilowatt hours which is
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
whether it's truly the average it's how
 
04:45:26.090 --> 04:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
we Define the average it's a 94 cents on
 
04:45:27.770 --> 04:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
their bill
 
04:45:30.350 --> 04:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
it provides monthly bill assistance for
 
04:45:32.930 --> 04:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
customers with incomes at or below 60
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
percent of New Hampshire State median so
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
you've seen fuel assistance
 
04:45:38.208 --> 04:45:38.218 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance and now
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
electric assistance all these folks go
 
04:45:42.050 --> 04:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
into the cap it's the same income
 
04:45:44.628 --> 04:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
eligibility level there's no confusion
 
04:45:46.610 --> 04:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
for customers they do one application
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
and they can get benefits from from the
 
04:45:50.400 --> 04:45:51.830 align:start position:0%
and they can get benefits from from the
programs

04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:45:53.868 --> 04:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
she said it is monthly bill assistance
 
04:45:56.208 --> 04:45:56.218 align:start position:0%
so unlike weatherization where it's just
 
04:45:57.650 --> 04:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
uh not sorry I'm sorry not
 
04:45:59.390 --> 04:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
weatherization the fuel assistance
 
04:46:01.010 --> 04:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
program where it's just during the
 
04:46:03.410 --> 04:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
winter months for heating the electric
 
04:46:05.570 --> 04:46:05.580 align:start position:0%
assistance program is a monthly discount
 
04:46:08.990 --> 04:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
on your bill for either 12 or 24 months
 
04:46:11.868 --> 04:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
and that's determined by
 
04:46:15.890 --> 04:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
um if you are have all members of your
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
household are age 65 and older and on a
 
04:46:21.170 --> 04:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
fixed income it's a 24-month
 
04:46:22.970 --> 04:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
certification period
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
the discount percentage applies to the
 
04:46:28.448 --> 04:46:28.458 align:start position:0%
first 750 kilowatt hours of usage to
 
04:46:32.090 --> 04:46:32.100 align:start position:0%
incent some conservation by consumers
 
04:46:37.010 --> 04:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
and the discount ranges range from 8 to
 
04:46:39.288 --> 04:46:39.298 align:start position:0%
76 percent
 
04:46:42.050 --> 04:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
and this is just an overview for you by
 
04:46:45.410 --> 04:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
household size and discount tier as you
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
can see that the highest discount the 76
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
percent discount is targeted to those
 
04:46:58.150 --> 04:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:02.090 --> 04:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
in the 2021-20 representative Thomas
 
04:47:04.850 --> 04:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
Douglas Thomas has a question thank you
 
04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:47:06.000 --> 04:47:06.890 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
question

04:47:06.890 --> 04:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:47:10.970 --> 04:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious uh on my electric bill
 
04:47:13.250 --> 04:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
there's an option if I want to they ask
 
04:47:15.650 --> 04:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
if would you pay one dollar towards
 
04:47:17.570 --> 04:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
electrical assistance fund or whatever
 
04:47:20.930 --> 04:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
it is is that part of your program
 
04:47:22.970 --> 04:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
it's not depending on who your electric
 
04:47:25.490 --> 04:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
utility is if you're a customer of
 
04:47:28.970 --> 04:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
eversource Liberty or Unitil they all
 
04:47:30.470 --> 04:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
participate in the neighbor helping
 
04:47:32.090 --> 04:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
neighbor program and that's where you
 
04:47:34.250 --> 04:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
get the envelope in your bill that says
 
04:47:35.810 --> 04:47:35.820 align:start position:0%
do you want to make a donation to The
 
04:47:37.970 --> 04:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
Neighbor helping neighbor program if
 
04:47:38.868 --> 04:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
you're a New Hampshire Electric
 
04:47:41.448 --> 04:47:41.458 align:start position:0%
Cooperative customer they have a pro a
 
04:47:43.788 --> 04:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
program called project care and it's a
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
Roundup function on your bill where if
 
04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
your bills you know
 
04:47:52.368 --> 04:47:52.378 align:start position:0%
69.12 she rounded up to seventy dollars
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
and that difference goes into the
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
project Care Program those are neighbor
 
04:48:01.970 --> 04:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
helping neighbor helps customers not
 
04:48:03.708 --> 04:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
otherwise eligible for assistance
 
04:48:05.690 --> 04:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
programs typically so if they wouldn't
 
04:48:07.910 --> 04:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
be eligible for fuel assistance they
 
04:48:10.670 --> 04:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
could get a this season up to 500
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
benefit from neighbor helping neighbor
 
04:48:15.110 --> 04:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
on their electric or gas bill and
 
04:48:16.730 --> 04:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
project care is run a little bit
 
04:48:18.530 --> 04:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
differently they have a project care
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
board that reviews the application and
 
04:48:23.150 --> 04:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
makes assistance grants to its members
 
04:48:24.650 --> 04:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
for the co-op
 
04:48:27.948 --> 04:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:30.170 --> 04:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
um so for the program year that ended
 
04:48:32.270 --> 04:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
this past September for the electric
 
04:48:34.490 --> 04:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
assistance program there were about 14
 
04:48:36.890 --> 04:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
million dollars in benefits provided to
 
04:48:36.900 --> 04:48:37.990 align:start position:0%
million dollars in benefits provided to
customers

04:48:37.990 --> 04:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:48:41.390 --> 04:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
average enrollment was slightly under 30
 
04:48:43.490 --> 04:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
000 households and the average monthly
 
04:48:46.250 --> 04:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
benefit was forty dollars or four
 
04:48:48.770 --> 04:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
hundred and eighty dollars for the year
 
04:48:50.810 --> 04:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
to date this year with higher Energy
 
04:48:53.208 --> 04:48:53.218 align:start position:0%
Service prices that we've talked about
 
04:48:56.690 --> 04:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
this morning the benefit level was 44
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
percent higher in October and 66 percent
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
higher in November current enrollment is
 
04:49:06.110 --> 04:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
a little over a little bit higher than
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
what's on this slide it's now 29 391
 
04:49:12.650 --> 04:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
customers and the legislature did
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
approve those seven million dollars in
 
04:49:16.430 --> 04:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
supplemental funding for the electric
 
04:49:18.770 --> 04:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
assistance program to ensure continued
 
04:49:20.750 --> 04:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
benefits throughout this program year
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
and the income eligible eligibility
 
04:49:36.050 --> 04:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
guidelines by discount tier oops sorry
 
04:49:38.510 --> 04:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going backwards on my slides the
 
04:49:40.610 --> 04:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
state emergency assistance programs that
 
04:49:42.350 --> 04:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
were approved by the legislature in
 
04:49:45.170 --> 04:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
September those two programs one is a
 
04:49:47.868 --> 04:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
emergency fuel assistance program one is
 
04:49:50.448 --> 04:49:50.458 align:start position:0%
an emergency electric benefit or
 
04:49:53.330 --> 04:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
supplemental electric benefit they it's
 
04:49:55.550 --> 04:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
for households that typically don't
 
04:49:58.430 --> 04:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
qualify for other low-income programs
 
04:50:00.350 --> 04:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
like fuel assistance or the electric
 
04:50:02.208 --> 04:50:02.218 align:start position:0%
assistance program
 
04:50:05.208 --> 04:50:05.218 align:start position:0%
so households greater than 60 percent of
 
04:50:07.128 --> 04:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State median income but
 
04:50:09.288 --> 04:50:09.298 align:start position:0%
less than 75 percent of New Hampshire
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
State median income
 
04:50:14.270 --> 04:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
the emergency fuel assistance benefit is
 
04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
a one-time credit of 450 dollars
 
04:50:20.030 --> 04:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
the emergency electric benefit is a
 
04:50:22.010 --> 04:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
one-time credit of two hundred dollars
 
04:50:24.050 --> 04:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that this
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
electric emergency electric benefit is
 
04:50:28.970 --> 04:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
also for customers of Municipal Electric
 
04:50:31.430 --> 04:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
utilities those customers are not
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
eligible for the electric assistance
 
04:50:35.570 --> 04:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
program because the program is funded
 
04:50:38.150 --> 04:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
through regulated utility customers
 
04:50:39.890 --> 04:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
through the system benefit charge on
 
04:50:42.050 --> 04:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
their bill
 
04:50:43.970 --> 04:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
um applications and eligibility are
 
04:50:45.650 --> 04:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
being done by the Community Action
 
04:50:49.128 --> 04:50:49.138 align:start position:0%
agencies I'm happy to say that benefits
 
04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
started to flow in December the end of
 
04:50:55.550 --> 04:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
December while we were able to leverage
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
some of the existing infrastructure for
 
04:51:00.530 --> 04:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
the fuel assistance application and the
 
04:51:02.530 --> 04:51:02.540 align:start position:0%
electric assistance program application
 
04:51:05.390 --> 04:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
there were enhancements that needed to
 
04:51:08.090 --> 04:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
be made to the software to accurately
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
track benefits
 
04:51:15.410 --> 04:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
funding reporting all those things that
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
are separate from the federally funded
 
04:51:21.170 --> 04:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance program and so those
 
04:51:21.180 --> 04:51:22.128 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance program and so those
those

04:51:22.128 --> 04:51:22.138 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
as is always the case software
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
enhancements take longer than we'd like
 
04:51:28.490 --> 04:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
them to but we did see benefits flow to
 
04:51:30.110 --> 04:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
customers at the end of September
 
04:51:30.120 --> 04:51:33.470 align:start position:0%
customers at the end of September
December

04:51:33.470 --> 04:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
and that this is 75 percent of New
 
04:51:38.208 --> 04:51:38.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State median income if you're
 
04:51:40.128 --> 04:51:40.138 align:start position:0%
wondering what that is is broken down by
 
04:51:42.230 --> 04:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
household on this last slide
 
04:51:45.170 --> 04:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
04:51:47.448 --> 04:51:47.458 align:start position:0%
since you're here may I ask because I
 
04:51:49.330 --> 04:51:49.340 align:start position:0%
was asked by a family in Manchester
 
04:51:51.830 --> 04:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
where did they go where exactly do they
 
04:51:54.410 --> 04:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
go to apply for this um
 
04:51:55.970 --> 04:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
a state emergency assistance program
 
04:51:57.948 --> 04:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
they go to the Community Action Agency
 
04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
so someone in Manchester would go to
 
04:52:02.448 --> 04:52:02.458 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire services
 
04:52:04.670 --> 04:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
we do have a list of all five Community
 
04:52:07.128 --> 04:52:07.138 align:start position:0%
Action agencies on our website their
 
04:52:09.730 --> 04:52:09.740 align:start position:0%
phone numbers links to their websites
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
but Southern New Hampshire Services
 
04:52:14.090 --> 04:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
would be the Community Action Agency for
 
04:52:16.490 --> 04:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
someone in Manchester
 
04:52:20.990 --> 04:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:23.930 --> 04:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
04:52:26.930 --> 04:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman how many how many
 
04:52:30.110 --> 04:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
times can someone apply for this
 
04:52:32.810 --> 04:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
one-time credit and within let's say a
 
04:52:36.410 --> 04:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
fiscal a calendar year once okay so if
 
04:52:38.810 --> 04:52:38.820 align:start position:0%
they someone applies now
 
04:52:40.970 --> 04:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
to to get a credit to offset the
 
04:52:42.890 --> 04:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
increase in prices as the prices go up
 
04:52:46.610 --> 04:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
again in six months they're have to wait
 
04:52:50.930 --> 04:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
this is so this program is a one-time
 
04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
not just a one-time credit but as we
 
04:52:55.250 --> 04:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
understand it a one-time program a
 
04:52:57.530 --> 04:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
one-time allotment of funding for these
 
04:53:00.410 --> 04:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
two programs for this winter heating
 
04:53:04.128 --> 04:53:04.138 align:start position:0%
season and any funding remaining lapses
 
04:53:06.948 --> 04:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund on June 30
 
04:53:06.958 --> 04:53:09.350 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund on June 30
2023.

04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
2023.
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
so they can apply once if I will say if
 
04:53:15.310 --> 04:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
their circumstances change and they find
 
04:53:19.368 --> 04:53:19.378 align:start position:0%
loss of a job uh some other catastrophic
 
04:53:21.770 --> 04:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
situation they could apply for the
 
04:53:23.690 --> 04:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
federal fuel assistance program and they
 
04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
might then be eligible for that if their
 
04:53:32.690 --> 04:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:35.570 --> 04:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
okay thank you continue
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh one last thing I just wanted to
 
04:53:39.770 --> 04:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
mention is
 
04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
um we talked a little bit earlier there
 
04:53:42.948 --> 04:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
are some questions about competitive
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
Electric Supply I said you know please
 
04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
feel free to send them over to the
 
04:53:47.868 --> 04:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
department and we can assist
 
04:53:50.150 --> 04:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
constituents we've talked a lot about
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
energy this morning but I did just want
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
to briefly mention that um
 
04:53:59.930 --> 04:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
gas water uh well we talked about gas as
 
04:54:01.730 --> 04:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
part of our energy But Water and Sewer
 
04:54:03.770 --> 04:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
are also under the purview of the
 
04:54:06.530 --> 04:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
Department of energy my team's there to
 
04:54:09.230 --> 04:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
help customers with not just electricity
 
04:54:11.570 --> 04:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
and gas natural gas but with water
 
04:54:14.030 --> 04:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions and Sewer questions for their
 
04:54:16.490 --> 04:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
regulated utilities
 
04:54:19.070 --> 04:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
um also for on some limited basis for
 
04:54:22.490 --> 04:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
telephone services particularly for what
 
04:54:24.708 --> 04:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
we think of as the former incumbent
 
04:54:26.750 --> 04:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
telephone companies we still we have
 
04:54:29.150 --> 04:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
relationships with them and some small
 
04:54:32.690 --> 04:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
role in overseeing their relationships
 
04:54:35.330 --> 04:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
with their customers and any of the
 
04:54:37.190 --> 04:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
larger companies that have been around
 
04:54:39.650 --> 04:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
for a while such as Comcast or now
 
04:54:43.070 --> 04:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
Breeze line we can often help customers
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
with those and we also have a
 
04:54:48.230 --> 04:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
Cooperative agreement with the cellular
 
04:54:50.510 --> 04:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
telephone industry Association to help
 
04:54:53.150 --> 04:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
with wireless just basically escalating
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
that into a higher level so it's not as
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
frustrating for folks to have to
 
04:55:00.170 --> 04:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
navigate their way through person after
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
person to get an issue resolved so it's
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
more than just energy and we're happy to
 
04:55:07.490 --> 04:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
help whoever needs assistance with their
 
04:55:14.330 --> 04:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:17.628 --> 04:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you all right and with
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:24.530 --> 04:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
now we're going to move on to
 
04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
Federal funding infrastructure
 
04:55:28.970 --> 04:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
investment and jobs act and inflation
 
04:55:32.208 --> 04:55:32.218 align:start position:0%
production act Mr Roberts
 
04:55:39.230 --> 04:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.090 --> 04:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
um uh we're afternoon good afternoon
 
04:55:42.770 --> 04:55:42.780 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
04:55:44.750 --> 04:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
um again Griffin Roberge
 
04:55:47.090 --> 04:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
um State energy program manager at the
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
um today I wanted to walk you through um
 
04:55:52.368 --> 04:55:52.378 align:start position:0%
what the department is doing in
 
04:55:54.170 --> 04:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
regarding uh regarding some of the
 
04:55:55.970 --> 04:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
federal funding opportunities coming out
 
04:55:58.368 --> 04:55:58.378 align:start position:0%
through the infrastructure investment
 
04:56:01.430 --> 04:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
and jobs act also called the iija you've
 
04:56:03.230 --> 04:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
also heard it uh referred to here today
 
04:56:04.910 --> 04:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
as the bipartisan infrastructure law
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's interchangeable there and the
 
04:56:09.890 --> 04:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act my presentation
 
04:56:12.890 --> 04:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
is largely going to focus on the formula
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
funding opportunities coming down
 
04:56:17.090 --> 04:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
through these bills uh Josh had
 
04:56:18.590 --> 04:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned the difference between formula
 
04:56:20.510 --> 04:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
and competitive uh funding opportunities
 
04:56:23.690 --> 04:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
in the former slide so just uh to
 
04:56:25.070 --> 04:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
mention we're just going to be focusing
 
04:56:27.230 --> 04:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
on the formula today
 
04:56:28.970 --> 04:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
so to start off I'm going to talk about
 
04:56:32.990 --> 04:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
the the iija as you all might know this
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
bill was signed into law by President
 
04:56:37.550 --> 04:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
Biden in November of 21.
 
04:56:39.708 --> 04:56:39.718 align:start position:0%
um the legislation provides some 1.2
 
04:56:41.510 --> 04:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
trillion for infrastructure related
 
04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
projects uh including energy related
 
04:56:46.190 --> 04:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
initiatives for our purposes here for
 
04:56:47.810 --> 04:56:47.820 align:start position:0%
energy related stuff
 
04:56:51.110 --> 04:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
um the bill allocates some 62 billion
 
04:56:53.448 --> 04:56:53.458 align:start position:0%
dollars to the U.S department of energy
 
04:56:55.850 --> 04:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
over a five-year period this funding
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
does a variety of things such as
 
04:57:00.410 --> 04:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
reinforcing existing programs expanding
 
04:57:02.330 --> 04:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
others and opening up some new funding
 
04:57:05.448 --> 04:57:05.458 align:start position:0%
opportunities and again depending on the
 
04:57:07.610 --> 04:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity it may be formula based or
 
04:57:09.350 --> 04:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
competitively based
 
04:57:12.770 --> 04:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
so to start off in my role as the state
 
04:57:15.770 --> 04:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
energy program manager I manage the
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
state energy program Grant this is an
 
04:57:20.930 --> 04:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
annual grant that comes down to States
 
04:57:24.530 --> 04:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
from the U.S department of energy the
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
department gives the U.S department of
 
04:57:29.990 --> 04:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
energy gives States a great deal of
 
04:57:32.570 --> 04:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
flexibility and how these funds can be
 
04:57:36.350 --> 04:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
used they really defer to States as the
 
04:57:38.570 --> 04:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
decision maker and using these funds to
 
04:57:40.730 --> 04:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
achieve various energy State energy
 
04:57:44.090 --> 04:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
initiatives or policy goals so there's a
 
04:57:46.610 --> 04:57:46.620 align:start position:0%
great deal of flexibility there in our
 
04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
annual Grant we get roughly between 450
 
04:57:53.330 --> 04:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
000 to 500 000 per year depending on the
 
04:57:54.770 --> 04:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
level of the federal allocation that's
 
04:57:58.250 --> 04:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
given out the uses for that largely fall
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
into three categories every year as we
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
use it to fund staff at the department
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
including myself
 
04:58:07.490 --> 04:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
um an mou between us and the New
 
04:58:08.810 --> 04:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of administrative
 
04:58:11.030 --> 04:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
services is we work closely with their
 
04:58:13.128 --> 04:58:13.138 align:start position:0%
state energy manager's office to
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
complete Energy Efficiency improvements
 
04:58:16.730 --> 04:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
in state-owned buildings and then
 
04:58:19.850 --> 04:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
finally we use some of the money for our
 
04:58:21.830 --> 04:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
seed grant program that stands for
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
school Energy Efficiency development
 
04:58:26.570 --> 04:58:26.580 align:start position:0%
grant program which I'll get into
 
04:58:28.910 --> 04:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
briefly into the next slide
 
04:58:32.208 --> 04:58:32.218 align:start position:0%
on top of that the infrastructure Bill
 
04:58:35.030 --> 04:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
appropriated about 500 million more into
 
04:58:36.730 --> 04:58:36.740 align:start position:0%
this program
 
04:58:39.110 --> 04:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with the 500 million
 
04:58:40.850 --> 04:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
dollar allocation the U.S department of
 
04:58:43.610 --> 04:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
energy decided to shave off 75 million
 
04:58:45.890 --> 04:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
off of that figure to withhold for
 
04:58:48.410 --> 04:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
technical assistance so it only leaves
 
04:58:51.470 --> 04:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
about 425 million left to disperse so
 
04:58:53.208 --> 04:58:53.218 align:start position:0%
that's leaving New Hampshire with about
 
04:58:56.090 --> 04:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
3.5 million to spend down over a
 
04:58:59.030 --> 04:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
five-year period our initial application
 
04:59:01.550 --> 04:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh proposed to the U.S department of
 
04:59:03.890 --> 04:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
energy to use portions of that money to
 
04:59:06.170 --> 04:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
fund staff in the department given the
 
04:59:06.180 --> 04:59:07.390 align:start position:0%
fund staff in the department given the
additional

04:59:07.390 --> 04:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:59:09.830 --> 04:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
influx of federal funding into the state
 
04:59:12.350 --> 04:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
through this bill in the ira we'd like
 
04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
to use some of that funding to staff up
 
04:59:16.250 --> 04:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
in order to develop these programs using
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
that funding we're also going to use
 
04:59:20.330 --> 04:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
some of it to reinforce our existing
 
04:59:22.850 --> 04:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
seed grant program and then some money
 
04:59:25.730 --> 04:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
potentially to use for an outside
 
04:59:28.010 --> 04:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
consultant for our state energy security
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
plan which is a plan that is required to
 
04:59:33.650 --> 04:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
be submitted to the U.S department of
 
04:59:36.050 --> 04:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
energy every time we wish to apply for
 
04:59:39.590 --> 04:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
set funding every year next slide so
 
04:59:42.230 --> 04:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
briefly uh the seed grant program this
 
04:59:43.910 --> 04:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
is a program that was excuse me before
 
04:59:45.770 --> 04:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
you move on yeah representative Thomas
 
04:59:47.750 --> 04:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
has a question yes thank you Mr chairman
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh going back
 
04:59:52.490 --> 04:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
is is that a continuous uh funding
 
04:59:54.610 --> 04:59:54.620 align:start position:0%
program uh
 
04:59:56.690 --> 04:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
the the state energy program we're
 
04:59:59.690 --> 04:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
talking about right the S so if you look
 
05:00:01.128 --> 05:00:01.138 align:start position:0%
on the slide on the left side you'll see
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
annual sep that is usually an annual
 
05:00:06.590 --> 05:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
allocation that's given out to States
 
05:00:09.288 --> 05:00:09.298 align:start position:0%
every year we apply for that money in
 
05:00:12.470 --> 05:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
three-year increments so this past year
 
05:00:14.810 --> 05:00:14.820 align:start position:0%
at the end of the last fiscal year we
 
05:00:16.730 --> 05:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
closed out a three-year period so we
 
05:00:18.708 --> 05:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
applied again and so we do that every
 
05:00:20.208 --> 05:00:20.218 align:start position:0%
year going forward for the next three
 
05:00:21.890 --> 05:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
years and so that's where we receive
 
05:00:26.448 --> 05:00:26.458 align:start position:0%
about that 450 000 to 500 000 allocation
 
05:00:28.250 --> 05:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:00:31.730 --> 05:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
yes I I guess uh thank you uh my point
 
05:00:33.410 --> 05:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
is that usually some of the money for
 
05:00:35.868 --> 05:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
your Staffing so your Staffing here is
 
05:00:37.730 --> 05:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
dependent upon that Federal money coming
 
05:00:42.050 --> 05:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
in every year yes okay thank you
 
05:00:44.448 --> 05:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:00:47.110 --> 05:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you um thank you Mr chair
 
05:00:50.510 --> 05:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh if somebody if an entity uses you'll
 
05:00:52.850 --> 05:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
need to get up I'm just gonna well no
 
05:00:54.770 --> 05:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
I'll get up after after I speak okay all
 
05:00:54.780 --> 05:00:55.610 align:start position:0%
I'll get up after after I speak okay all
right

05:00:55.610 --> 05:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
um if an entity uses uh some of this
 
05:00:59.990 --> 05:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
grant money for Energy Efficiency do
 
05:01:03.530 --> 05:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
they still qualify for NH saves uh yes
 
05:01:05.690 --> 05:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
so for example and I'll get into it in a
 
05:01:07.010 --> 05:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
second but um our New Hampshire
 
05:01:08.990 --> 05:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services uh
 
05:01:10.550 --> 05:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they can will often
 
05:01:11.810 --> 05:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
leverage rebates from New Hampshire
 
05:01:14.448 --> 05:01:14.458 align:start position:0%
saves uh this helps kind of extend the
 
05:01:16.250 --> 05:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
money that they receive from us so
 
05:01:18.170 --> 05:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
they're leveraging other funds and we
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
often see that in our seed grant program
 
05:01:22.610 --> 05:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
is where we have public schools also uh
 
05:01:24.650 --> 05:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
to fund the project in its entirety will
 
05:01:27.050 --> 05:01:27.060 align:start position:0%
leverage New Hampshire saves rebates and
 
05:01:29.208 --> 05:01:29.218 align:start position:0%
couple that with it
 
05:01:32.030 --> 05:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
05:01:33.530 --> 05:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
05:01:35.930 --> 05:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm sorry if I'm math challenged
 
05:01:39.410 --> 05:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
but um I didn't understand the uh the
 
05:01:41.330 --> 05:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
3.5 million that New Hampshire has to
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
spend down yes over a five-year period
 
05:01:46.070 --> 05:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
how does that relate to the 500 million
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
dollars in funding so the 500 million
 
05:01:51.590 --> 05:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
was an allocation made through the
 
05:01:53.208 --> 05:01:53.218 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Bill the infrastructure
 
05:01:55.550 --> 05:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
Bill said we're going to put 500 million
 
05:01:57.288 --> 05:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
dollars into the state energy program
 
05:01:59.690 --> 05:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
additional appropriation what then
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
occurred was the money got to usdue and
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
because this is an additional pot of
 
05:02:04.440 --> 05:02:05.570 align:start position:0%
because this is an additional pot of
money

05:02:05.570 --> 05:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:02:05.580 --> 05:02:06.170 align:start position:0%
money
um

05:02:06.170 --> 05:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:08.990 --> 05:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
that states can use they decide to set
 
05:02:11.628 --> 05:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
up uh take a portion of that allocation
 
05:02:13.250 --> 05:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
for technical assistance so that's where
 
05:02:15.288 --> 05:02:15.298 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about 75 million removed
 
05:02:16.730 --> 05:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
from the allocation so that leaves us
 
05:02:19.788 --> 05:02:19.798 align:start position:0%
with about 425 million left based on a
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
formula that was established by the
 
05:02:25.310 --> 05:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
department that's where we come that's
 
05:02:26.990 --> 05:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
where by the U.S department of energy
 
05:02:28.368 --> 05:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
that's where they came down with our
 
05:02:30.170 --> 05:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
allocation New Hampshire getting 3.5
 
05:02:32.750 --> 05:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
million we get all of that money up
 
05:02:34.850 --> 05:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
front and then we have to spend it down
 
05:02:37.550 --> 05:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
over the next course of five years
 
05:02:39.230 --> 05:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
follow up so so the the 500 million and
 
05:02:45.770 --> 05:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
the 75 million that's nationally that's
 
05:02:47.090 --> 05:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
nationally correct I thought that was
 
05:02:49.550 --> 05:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yeah I'd be a little I think I
 
05:02:50.628 --> 05:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit more pleased if we
 
05:02:52.910 --> 05:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
were getting 500 million but no it's uh
 
05:02:56.810 --> 05:02:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:01.610 --> 05:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:03.050 --> 05:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
I didn't see your hand I'm sorry
 
05:03:05.390 --> 05:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan thank you Mr chair
 
05:03:07.610 --> 05:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
I hate to be a curmudgeon but when I
 
05:03:10.128 --> 05:03:10.138 align:start position:0%
think of uh the infrastructure act I
 
05:03:12.708 --> 05:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
think of actual infrastructure sure and
 
05:03:14.330 --> 05:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
I mean maybe it's maybe you're going to
 
05:03:16.610 --> 05:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
cover it somewhere else but and I know
 
05:03:18.890 --> 05:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
three million is not that a great amount
 
05:03:21.170 --> 05:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
of money over five years but
 
05:03:24.050 --> 05:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
what about other infrastructure needs in
 
05:03:26.208 --> 05:03:26.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire sure and and just because
 
05:03:28.250 --> 05:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh how do I want to say this is that
 
05:03:31.430 --> 05:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
there are is about 1.2 trillion in total
 
05:03:31.440 --> 05:03:32.990 align:start position:0%
there are is about 1.2 trillion in total
spending

05:03:32.990 --> 05:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
spending
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
um in the infrastructure Bill I'm not at
 
05:03:37.850 --> 05:03:37.860 align:start position:0%
Liberty to discuss what might be going
 
05:03:39.410 --> 05:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
to say the New Hampshire Department of
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation for say Transportation
 
05:03:42.410 --> 05:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
purposes what's going to the Department
 
05:03:45.050 --> 05:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture for agricultural purposes
 
05:03:46.970 --> 05:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
I think just for the purposes of my
 
05:03:48.230 --> 05:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
presentation here today I'm just talking
 
05:03:50.270 --> 05:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
about the energy related uh provisions
 
05:03:52.368 --> 05:03:52.378 align:start position:0%
of that bill
 
05:03:55.128 --> 05:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
representative Summers as a question
 
05:03:57.230 --> 05:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman to go off of
 
05:03:58.610 --> 05:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
basically the question you just asked a
 
05:04:00.470 --> 05:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative is uh we're talking about
 
05:04:03.050 --> 05:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and we're we're at risk
 
05:04:04.850 --> 05:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
of not having enough energy for the
 
05:04:06.770 --> 05:04:06.780 align:start position:0%
North country or the part folks in New
 
05:04:08.030 --> 05:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how much of this
 
05:04:09.948 --> 05:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
infrastructure go I see these Staffing I
 
05:04:12.288 --> 05:04:12.298 align:start position:0%
see the nhds but how much do we have she
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
have going to the actual electrical
 
05:04:17.090 --> 05:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the actual electrical
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
grid for the state so I think I think uh
 
05:04:21.830 --> 05:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're hitting on one of my slides uh
 
05:04:23.150 --> 05:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
you'll probably in the slideshow the
 
05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
grid resiliency grants which I will get
 
05:04:26.990 --> 05:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
to um in a moment to talk more about the
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:33.530 --> 05:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
so uh just talking a little bit about
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
our seed grant program this is a program
 
05:04:37.970 --> 05:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
started by the former office of
 
05:04:41.270 --> 05:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives back in 2018.
 
05:04:43.490 --> 05:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
um again this program is solely funded
 
05:04:46.490 --> 05:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
with State energy program dollars and it
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
is a one-time competitive matching grant
 
05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
program that's offered to public schools
 
05:04:52.850 --> 05:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
and small communities for Energy
 
05:04:56.030 --> 05:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
Efficiency improvements funded projects
 
05:04:57.708 --> 05:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
really kind of have the Dual benefit of
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
providing a safer healthier learning
 
05:05:02.030 --> 05:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
environment for students and staff while
 
05:05:04.250 --> 05:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
also reducing a school's operating costs
 
05:05:06.590 --> 05:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
providing a net benefit to local
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers in the past we've
 
05:05:12.288 --> 05:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
funded Pro we typically fund one school
 
05:05:15.650 --> 05:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
every year since 18 we have funded
 
05:05:17.690 --> 05:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
schools as you'll see here our first one
 
05:05:19.850 --> 05:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
was in Hill which is Jeannie D Blake
 
05:05:22.010 --> 05:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
elementary school second one was lemster
 
05:05:25.610 --> 05:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
Community School we've since also funded
 
05:05:28.250 --> 05:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
New Boston Litchfield and we are
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
currently working with our fifth awardee
 
05:05:31.368 --> 05:05:31.378 align:start position:0%
in Berlin
 
05:05:34.610 --> 05:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
um so to date about 335 000 has been
 
05:05:37.850 --> 05:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
allocated out of that program to schools
 
05:05:39.050 --> 05:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
um and as I mentioned we're working with
 
05:05:43.190 --> 05:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:45.288 --> 05:05:45.298 align:start position:0%
um another funding opportunity that's
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
coming down through the infrastructure
 
05:05:49.490 --> 05:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
bill is the Energy Efficiency revolving
 
05:05:52.610 --> 05:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund capitalization grant program
 
05:05:54.410 --> 05:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
um it's a lot of words
 
05:05:56.810 --> 05:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
um this is a program that offers
 
05:05:58.970 --> 05:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
um grants to states to establish
 
05:06:02.270 --> 05:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
revolving loan funds uh those loan funds
 
05:06:04.550 --> 05:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
would then offer loans to conduct energy
 
05:06:06.830 --> 05:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
Audits and Energy Efficiency upgrades
 
05:06:09.288 --> 05:06:09.298 align:start position:0%
and retrofits for residential and
 
05:06:11.750 --> 05:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
Commercial properties as States
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
establish these revolving loan funds the
 
05:06:15.708 --> 05:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
U.S department of energy is actively
 
05:06:17.750 --> 05:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
encouraging states to have several goals
 
05:06:20.030 --> 05:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
in mind such as maximizing Energy
 
05:06:22.610 --> 05:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
savings leveraging private Capital to
 
05:06:25.070 --> 05:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
the extent possible create jobs and
 
05:06:26.570 --> 05:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
support the Biden administration's
 
05:06:28.690 --> 05:06:28.700 align:start position:0%
justice 40 initiative
 
05:06:30.890 --> 05:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
just for a little bit of background the
 
05:06:32.448 --> 05:06:32.458 align:start position:0%
justice for the initiative is an
 
05:06:34.250 --> 05:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
executive order issued by the Biden
 
05:06:36.470 --> 05:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
Administration that establishes a goal
 
05:06:39.230 --> 05:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
that 40 percent of the benefits of clean
 
05:06:41.150 --> 05:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
and clean and of climate and clean
 
05:06:43.150 --> 05:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
energy Investments flow to to
 
05:06:45.770 --> 05:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged communities so they really
 
05:06:48.050 --> 05:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
want to ensure that communities who have
 
05:06:49.850 --> 05:06:49.860 align:start position:0%
received significant under investment or
 
05:06:52.030 --> 05:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
disinvestment for a long period of time
 
05:06:55.368 --> 05:06:55.378 align:start position:0%
you know start getting due consideration
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
as these dollars are dispersed the
 
05:07:00.170 --> 05:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
formula for this program is quite unique
 
05:07:02.208 --> 05:07:02.218 align:start position:0%
in that uh
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
higher grants are given to Priority
 
05:07:07.430 --> 05:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
states that have high energy consumption
 
05:07:09.230 --> 05:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
or high energy related carbon Emissions
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
on a per capita basis New Hampshire is
 
05:07:13.610 --> 05:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
not considered a primary State under
 
05:07:15.590 --> 05:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
that allocation so our allocation is
 
05:07:17.570 --> 05:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
significantly smaller than those States
 
05:07:19.490 --> 05:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
so it's leaving us with about eight
 
05:07:22.010 --> 05:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in change to
 
05:07:23.570 --> 05:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
establish a revolving Loan Fund under
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
this program
 
05:07:27.770 --> 05:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
the next program is excuse me
 
05:07:29.690 --> 05:07:29.700 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas has a
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair
 
05:07:34.610 --> 05:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
um regarding the energy audit and I'll
 
05:07:36.050 --> 05:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
get up in a second
 
05:07:38.448 --> 05:07:38.458 align:start position:0%
um regarding the energy audits um how do
 
05:07:40.128 --> 05:07:40.138 align:start position:0%
you qualify who does them do they have
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
to be certified do they have to do some
 
05:07:43.970 --> 05:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
kind of training or is there
 
05:07:45.770 --> 05:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
something like that that qualifies who
 
05:07:47.810 --> 05:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
can do an energy audit sure so that
 
05:07:49.128 --> 05:07:49.138 align:start position:0%
that's something we're currently
 
05:07:51.470 --> 05:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
digesting with uh got that with guidance
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's recently just come out on this uh
 
05:07:55.610 --> 05:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
grant program
 
05:08:00.650 --> 05:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
um Auditors do need to be uh certified
 
05:08:02.270 --> 05:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and everything like that uh energy
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
audits under this program also must meet
 
05:08:06.110 --> 05:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
certain criteria that the US Department
 
05:08:08.570 --> 05:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
of energy would like to see such as the
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
audits using uh technical assistance
 
05:08:12.350 --> 05:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
offered by the US Department of energy
 
05:08:14.330 --> 05:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
or using certain metrics offered by the
 
05:08:16.910 --> 05:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
U.S department of energy and then when
 
05:08:18.590 --> 05:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
it comes to funding the upgrades and
 
05:08:21.050 --> 05:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
retrofits the department wants to see
 
05:08:24.410 --> 05:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
that those retrofits those upgrades were
 
05:08:26.810 --> 05:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
conducted as a result of an energy Rod
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
it performed under this program or some
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
other similar looking audit
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:08:37.730 --> 05:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
does this also include benchmarking uh
 
05:08:43.850 --> 05:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:48.110 --> 05:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you uh next Slide the the
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
next another Federal funding opportunity
 
05:08:51.170 --> 05:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
coming down through the infrastructure
 
05:08:52.970 --> 05:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
bill is the Energy Efficiency and
 
05:08:55.250 --> 05:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
conservation block grant program or the
 
05:08:57.770 --> 05:08:57.780 align:start position:0%
eecbg program
 
05:08:59.690 --> 05:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
um to the extent any of you were maybe
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
involved in municipal government back
 
05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
during the Great Recession this program
 
05:09:07.490 --> 05:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
might strike you as being uh somewhat
 
05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
familiar because this is a program that
 
05:09:12.170 --> 05:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
started out uh back in the uh Recovery
 
05:09:15.110 --> 05:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
Act during the Great Recession and is
 
05:09:16.850 --> 05:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
being revived again under this
 
05:09:20.390 --> 05:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill so this uh this
 
05:09:23.270 --> 05:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
program offers 550 million dollars into
 
05:09:25.330 --> 05:09:25.340 align:start position:0%
this program to be dispersed to States
 
05:09:27.948 --> 05:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
units of local government and Indian
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
tribes to reduce fossil fuel emissions
 
05:09:32.810 --> 05:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
reduce total energy use and improve
 
05:09:35.030 --> 05:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency the uses of these
 
05:09:37.490 --> 05:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
funds are quite broad they can include
 
05:09:39.350 --> 05:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
energy audits lighting retrofits
 
05:09:41.570 --> 05:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
renewable energy installations that type
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
05:09:42.718 --> 05:09:43.368 align:start position:0%
of thing
um

05:09:43.368 --> 05:09:43.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:45.890 --> 05:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
with this 550 million dollar allocation
 
05:09:48.170 --> 05:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
the U.S department of energy again came
 
05:09:50.208 --> 05:09:50.218 align:start position:0%
in and took some money off the top they
 
05:09:52.490 --> 05:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
took 20 of the allocation out for
 
05:09:54.170 --> 05:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
technical assistance
 
05:09:56.570 --> 05:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
um leaving with about 440 million
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
dollars to be dispersed uh according to
 
05:09:59.810 --> 05:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
a formula to all these different
 
05:10:02.448 --> 05:10:02.458 align:start position:0%
entities so New Hampshire's allocation
 
05:10:05.090 --> 05:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
the state is receiving about 1.6 million
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
dollars direct formula grants are also
 
05:10:10.550 --> 05:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
being made to each of the 10 counties in
 
05:10:12.410 --> 05:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
the state as well as the 10 largest
 
05:10:14.090 --> 05:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state so that
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
includes Concord Dairy Dover Hudson
 
05:10:19.550 --> 05:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Manchester Merrimack Nashua
 
05:10:21.530 --> 05:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
Rochester and Salem we will all be
 
05:10:24.850 --> 05:10:24.860 align:start position:0%
receiving their own direct allocations
 
05:10:27.948 --> 05:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
we do anticipate that this funding
 
05:10:30.110 --> 05:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
program will likely come online sometime
 
05:10:32.868 --> 05:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
this month whereby people can begin that
 
05:10:35.510 --> 05:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
application process we are eagerly
 
05:10:37.550 --> 05:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
waiting to see when that guidance drops
 
05:10:39.530 --> 05:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
from the US Department of energy if any
 
05:10:42.650 --> 05:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
of you folks live or represent any of
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
those 10 municipalities values certainly
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
encourage you to hit them up as we have
 
05:10:47.510 --> 05:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
to let them know that this money is
 
05:10:50.208 --> 05:10:50.218 align:start position:0%
coming and that concludes at least that
 
05:10:52.670 --> 05:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
program if you want to hit the next one
 
05:10:54.050 --> 05:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
circling back to your question
 
05:10:55.910 --> 05:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative summaries
 
05:10:58.730 --> 05:10:58.740 align:start position:0%
um the uh infrastructure Bill certainly
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
makes a great deal of investments in the
 
05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
nation's electric grid this is just one
 
05:11:07.610 --> 05:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
of a handful of other programs but this
 
05:11:13.128 --> 05:11:13.138 align:start position:0%
is just a form a formula uh program this
 
05:11:15.410 --> 05:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
um this program seeks to make money
 
05:11:16.970 --> 05:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
available to the nation's electric grid
 
05:11:18.410 --> 05:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
to make it more resilient against
 
05:11:20.510 --> 05:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
disruptive events brought about by a
 
05:11:22.610 --> 05:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
changing climate so this section offers
 
05:11:25.788 --> 05:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
grid resiliency grants to States who
 
05:11:27.948 --> 05:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
would then sub-grant them out to
 
05:11:30.410 --> 05:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
eligible entities per the program to
 
05:11:32.330 --> 05:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
then undertake activities that would
 
05:11:33.948 --> 05:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
Harden the grid against disruptive
 
05:11:37.250 --> 05:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
events and those activities uh that can
 
05:11:38.690 --> 05:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
take place under this program are quite
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
broad include the reconductoring of
 
05:11:42.530 --> 05:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
power lines undergrounding of electrical
 
05:11:44.570 --> 05:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
equipment weatherization Technologies
 
05:11:46.868 --> 05:11:46.878 align:start position:0%
and Equipment Etc
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
there is supposed to be an annual
 
05:11:51.890 --> 05:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
allocation coming out to every state for
 
05:11:53.810 --> 05:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
the next five years within the first
 
05:11:55.970 --> 05:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
year we are slated to receive about 3.3
 
05:11:57.890 --> 05:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
million dollars in funding which we
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
would then likely set up in a
 
05:12:01.550 --> 05:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
competitive grant program to then offer
 
05:12:04.550 --> 05:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
to uh our new on the electric utilities
 
05:12:06.890 --> 05:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
in the states and that also includes a
 
05:12:09.530 --> 05:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
municipally owned Electric utilities
 
05:12:11.270 --> 05:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
um considerations for this program at
 
05:12:12.590 --> 05:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
least for the applications that would
 
05:12:13.730 --> 05:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
come in
 
05:12:13.740 --> 05:12:14.330 align:start position:0%
come in
um

05:12:14.330 --> 05:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:16.430 --> 05:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
want to hit some of the priorities that
 
05:12:18.410 --> 05:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
the that the infrastructure Bill wants
 
05:12:20.930 --> 05:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
us to take note of such as prioritizing
 
05:12:23.090 --> 05:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged communities reducing the
 
05:12:24.830 --> 05:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
frequency of disruptive events and
 
05:12:27.170 --> 05:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
leveraging the leveraging workforce
 
05:12:28.930 --> 05:12:28.940 align:start position:0%
training programs and that type of thing
 
05:12:32.650 --> 05:12:32.660 align:start position:0%
there are also other competitively based
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
electric grid type funding opportunities
 
05:12:37.610 --> 05:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
which I can talk more about offline I
 
05:12:38.628 --> 05:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
just didn't include them in today's
 
05:12:39.890 --> 05:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
presentation I'm just talking about the
 
05:12:41.628 --> 05:12:41.638 align:start position:0%
formula funding
 
05:12:44.448 --> 05:12:44.458 align:start position:0%
um next slide if that's all right
 
05:12:47.270 --> 05:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh next steps on the iija program
 
05:12:50.448 --> 05:12:50.458 align:start position:0%
Guidance just continue to develop across
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
the programs I mentioned as well as a
 
05:12:52.670 --> 05:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
lot of the other competitive
 
05:12:54.650 --> 05:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
opportunities we continue to stay aware
 
05:12:57.288 --> 05:12:57.298 align:start position:0%
of the latest program developments as I
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are a number of
 
05:12:59.868 --> 05:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
competitive funding opportunities that
 
05:13:01.368 --> 05:13:01.378 align:start position:0%
the department is continuing to review
 
05:13:03.948 --> 05:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
and consider next steps with for you
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
folks here
 
05:13:07.970 --> 05:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
um as resources we did establish a web
 
05:13:10.490 --> 05:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
page on our website to kind of advertise
 
05:13:12.170 --> 05:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
select Federal funding opportunities
 
05:13:14.690 --> 05:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
through this infrastructure bill so if
 
05:13:16.730 --> 05:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
your municipality is asking questions if
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
you've got a municipal energy committee
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's maybe discussing some of this
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
stuff that might be a good resource for
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
them to consider I've also included a
 
05:13:27.530 --> 05:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
link on there to the U.S department of
 
05:13:29.390 --> 05:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
Energy's a webpage about infrastructure
 
05:13:31.730 --> 05:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
funding as well as a guidebook from the
 
05:13:33.530 --> 05:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
White House with all the various funding
 
05:13:35.448 --> 05:13:35.458 align:start position:0%
opportunities through the infrastructure
 
05:13:37.150 --> 05:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
Bill and that includes transportation
 
05:13:39.410 --> 05:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
agriculture related Investments and that
 
05:13:40.850 --> 05:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
type of thing and obviously if anyone
 
05:13:42.830 --> 05:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
has any questions feel free to reach out
 
05:13:42.840 --> 05:13:46.910 align:start position:0%
has any questions feel free to reach out
anytime

05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:48.830 --> 05:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative barasni has a question
 
05:13:51.470 --> 05:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question on the previous slide
 
05:13:59.448 --> 05:13:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:02.390 --> 05:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
um I can't remember
 
05:14:04.970 --> 05:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm sorry
 
05:14:07.368 --> 05:14:07.378 align:start position:0%
um the I if it's all right with you
 
05:14:08.750 --> 05:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative I can certainly follow up
 
05:14:11.208 --> 05:14:11.218 align:start position:0%
with you the uses are quite broad but
 
05:14:13.550 --> 05:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
they vary across the various programs
 
05:14:15.530 --> 05:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
and I just don't know it off the top of
 
05:14:18.430 --> 05:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:21.050 --> 05:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:14:25.310 --> 05:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:27.770 --> 05:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
okay continue please
 
05:14:27.780 --> 05:14:29.810 align:start position:0%
okay continue please
so

05:14:29.810 --> 05:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:31.550 --> 05:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
um finally just stepping on to the
 
05:14:33.708 --> 05:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act this bill was
 
05:14:37.010 --> 05:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
signed into law in August of last year
 
05:14:38.810 --> 05:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
um this is a 391 billion dollar
 
05:14:41.208 --> 05:14:41.218 align:start position:0%
investment to lower energy costs
 
05:14:43.128 --> 05:14:43.138 align:start position:0%
accelerate private investment and clean
 
05:14:44.990 --> 05:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
energy strengthen Supply chains and
 
05:14:48.708 --> 05:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
create jobs about 35 billion is invested
 
05:14:50.750 --> 05:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
in clean energy Investments that are
 
05:14:52.490 --> 05:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
managed by the U.S department of energy
 
05:14:54.590 --> 05:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
for our purposes here I think I'm going
 
05:14:56.448 --> 05:14:56.458 align:start position:0%
to focus largely on two Provisions that
 
05:14:59.330 --> 05:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
authorize about 8.8 billion and two
 
05:15:01.010 --> 05:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
rebate programs for home Energy
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and electrification projects
 
05:15:06.350 --> 05:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
the first rebate program is the home
 
05:15:08.930 --> 05:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
electrification rebate program this is
 
05:15:11.810 --> 05:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
about 4.2 billion being made to this
 
05:15:14.090 --> 05:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
program it would offer grants to States
 
05:15:16.610 --> 05:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
who would then offer rebates for the
 
05:15:18.970 --> 05:15:18.980 align:start position:0%
purchase or installation of High Energy
 
05:15:22.128 --> 05:15:22.138 align:start position:0%
Efficiency home appliances and Equipment
 
05:15:24.650 --> 05:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at least is slated to
 
05:15:27.708 --> 05:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
receive about 3 34.7 million over the
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
next 10 years we have that money all up
 
05:15:31.310 --> 05:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
front we get to spend it down over the
 
05:15:33.788 --> 05:15:33.798 align:start position:0%
next 10 years rebates are available
 
05:15:37.368 --> 05:15:37.378 align:start position:0%
largely in uh rebates are largely
 
05:15:39.230 --> 05:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
targeted toward low to moderate income
 
05:15:41.090 --> 05:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
households for electrification
 
05:15:43.610 --> 05:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
improvement projects so rebates May
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
apply to the purchase and installation
 
05:15:48.050 --> 05:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
of EPA certified energy star appliances
 
05:15:50.750 --> 05:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
electric loads service centers electric
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
stoves insulations Etc I do want to
 
05:15:56.810 --> 05:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
mention from the outset and I'll mention
 
05:15:59.570 --> 05:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
it again is that these rebate programs
 
05:16:01.550 --> 05:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
have generated quite a bit of Interest
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine from residents and
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
citizens across the state but these
 
05:16:08.510 --> 05:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
rebates are not available yet and they
 
05:16:10.250 --> 05:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
will likely not be available until the
 
05:16:13.550 --> 05:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
end of the year or early 2024 as the U.S
 
05:16:15.050 --> 05:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
department of energy is still in the
 
05:16:17.030 --> 05:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
early stages of developing guidance for
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
these rebate programs so if you do get
 
05:16:20.990 --> 05:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
questions from constituents you know
 
05:16:22.490 --> 05:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's great that they're interested but
 
05:16:25.970 --> 05:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
unfortunately just wait be patient if
 
05:16:27.890 --> 05:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
you want to go on to the next one
 
05:16:30.830 --> 05:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
the last last rebate program is the
 
05:16:32.628 --> 05:16:32.638 align:start position:0%
whole homes rebate program this is about
 
05:16:35.868 --> 05:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
4.3 billion in Grants made to States
 
05:16:37.970 --> 05:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
um again similar to the other one we get
 
05:16:40.670 --> 05:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
the we get grants which we then rebate
 
05:16:40.680 --> 05:16:41.628 align:start position:0%
the we get grants which we then rebate
out

05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:16:44.090 --> 05:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
um to eligible parties for
 
05:16:46.310 --> 05:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and for projects that produce uh
 
05:16:48.230 --> 05:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
Energy savings for from a home energy
 
05:16:50.628 --> 05:16:50.638 align:start position:0%
upgrade New Hampshire's slayed to get
 
05:16:52.970 --> 05:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
about 34.9 million out of that
 
05:16:55.490 --> 05:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
allocation rebates are available to
 
05:16:57.230 --> 05:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
households of any income but rebate
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
amounts will vary based on the projected
 
05:17:02.050 --> 05:17:02.060 align:start position:0%
Energy savings of a given Improvement
 
05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
the projects eligible for this rebate
 
05:17:06.288 --> 05:17:06.298 align:start position:0%
are based on actual energy performance
 
05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
savings and the rebate includes costs a
 
05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
rebate can also cover costs associated
 
05:17:14.270 --> 05:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
with the work performed for the
 
05:17:16.128 --> 05:17:16.138 align:start position:0%
Improvement or the equipment needed to
 
05:17:18.170 --> 05:17:18.180 align:start position:0%
install the upgrades and again to
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
emphasize this is a program that's still
 
05:17:22.730 --> 05:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
developing guidance will likely not be
 
05:17:24.410 --> 05:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
available until end of the year or early
 
05:17:24.420 --> 05:17:26.330 align:start position:0%
available until end of the year or early
2024.

05:17:26.330 --> 05:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
2024.
 
05:17:29.448 --> 05:17:29.458 align:start position:0%
and so next step
 
05:17:29.458 --> 05:17:31.010 align:start position:0%
and so next step
representative

05:17:31.010 --> 05:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:17:34.310 --> 05:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
oh representative nodder
 
05:17:38.270 --> 05:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you the air ceiling um is at um
 
05:17:40.730 --> 05:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
the the product that smells like Elmer's
 
05:17:45.230 --> 05:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
it it might I can't say I have any
 
05:17:49.490 --> 05:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
personal experience with it or anything
 
05:17:51.410 --> 05:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
like that so I'm sorry I couldn't answer
 
05:17:54.530 --> 05:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
that directly or anything like that
 
05:17:56.750 --> 05:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
05:17:59.150 --> 05:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh regarding these
 
05:18:01.550 --> 05:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
rebates and that they won't be available
 
05:18:03.708 --> 05:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
for probably about a year
 
05:18:06.770 --> 05:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the work has to be
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
done at least a year out I mean if
 
05:18:10.490 --> 05:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
somebody had the work done this year
 
05:18:12.890 --> 05:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
could they apply retroactively that is
 
05:18:14.510 --> 05:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
something that is currently being
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
discussed in these discussions with the
 
05:18:18.110 --> 05:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
U.S department of energy as they develop
 
05:18:19.490 --> 05:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
that guidance whether or not somebody
 
05:18:21.410 --> 05:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
say did an improvement this month
 
05:18:23.090 --> 05:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
whether or not it would qualify for a
 
05:18:24.590 --> 05:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
rebate that's available say next year
 
05:18:26.448 --> 05:18:26.458 align:start position:0%
it's something that's continuing to
 
05:18:28.850 --> 05:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
evolve and I I don't want to
 
05:18:30.590 --> 05:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
I don't want to jump the gun on that
 
05:18:32.628 --> 05:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
tell people that they that they will I
 
05:18:33.890 --> 05:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
don't want to be accused of giving
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
somebody misinformation
 
05:18:37.610 --> 05:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
um but I would just say I would just
 
05:18:39.890 --> 05:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
encourage uh those interested to
 
05:18:41.810 --> 05:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
certainly have some patience and wait
 
05:18:44.510 --> 05:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
and see thank you yep representative
 
05:18:46.788 --> 05:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
Summers has a question
 
05:18:48.708 --> 05:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh quick question
 
05:18:50.448 --> 05:18:50.458 align:start position:0%
I've looked through each one of these
 
05:18:52.010 --> 05:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
grants and I understand each one of them
 
05:18:54.708 --> 05:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
for winterizing and appliances and high
 
05:18:57.470 --> 05:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency home Energy savings and stuff
 
05:18:59.990 --> 05:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
like that but um is there any grant that
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
I asked earlier about the grid but is
 
05:19:04.670 --> 05:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
there any grants or or reductions and
 
05:19:06.170 --> 05:19:06.180 align:start position:0%
what actually the Crux of the issue
 
05:19:08.750 --> 05:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
which is the pricing of natural gas and
 
05:19:10.910 --> 05:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
heating oil or is it just trying to
 
05:19:12.350 --> 05:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
We're just trying to rebrate an issue
 
05:19:15.288 --> 05:19:15.298 align:start position:0%
out of the way yeah I mean I I thank you
 
05:19:16.850 --> 05:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
for the question I think a lot of these
 
05:19:20.330 --> 05:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
programs are largely going to projects
 
05:19:22.810 --> 05:19:22.820 align:start position:0%
that could reduce costs for individual
 
05:19:25.490 --> 05:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
commercial building owners whether
 
05:19:27.288 --> 05:19:27.298 align:start position:0%
you're in municipality or business or a
 
05:19:29.690 --> 05:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
resident if it's something to the effect
 
05:19:31.610 --> 05:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
of say you know for example State energy
 
05:19:34.128 --> 05:19:34.138 align:start position:0%
program Grant there is an explicit
 
05:19:36.190 --> 05:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
prohibition there cannot be used to say
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh cover the cost of any type of rate or
 
05:19:40.670 --> 05:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
pay anybody's electric bill or anything
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:19:44.930 --> 05:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
um I can't think of a specific program
 
05:19:46.910 --> 05:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's focused on say natural gas or
 
05:19:48.350 --> 05:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
anything like that out of this program
 
05:19:49.970 --> 05:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
but I can certainly take a look at that
 
05:19:52.310 --> 05:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
and get back to you if that's all right
 
05:19:55.850 --> 05:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:55.860 --> 05:19:59.090 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:19:59.090 --> 05:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:01.010 --> 05:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative muns
 
05:20:02.990 --> 05:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:20:05.708 --> 05:20:05.718 align:start position:0%
um on slide 77
 
05:20:08.410 --> 05:20:08.420 align:start position:0%
it talks about rebates being available
 
05:20:12.170 --> 05:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
for electric for electric load service
 
05:20:14.150 --> 05:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
centers is that a fancy way of saying
 
05:20:18.430 --> 05:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
smart meter again I
 
05:20:21.170 --> 05:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
yes electric panels in your house I I
 
05:20:23.990 --> 05:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
just again guidance for this is still
 
05:20:26.448 --> 05:20:26.458 align:start position:0%
developing and you know the information
 
05:20:28.850 --> 05:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
I received was from an FAQ on the U.S
 
05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
department of energy website and so this
 
05:20:32.330 --> 05:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
is what was on there I don't want to
 
05:20:34.788 --> 05:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
give any more information or again cause
 
05:20:36.590 --> 05:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
any misinformation or anything like that
 
05:20:40.430 --> 05:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you thank you
 
05:20:42.890 --> 05:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
so next steps for the um inflation
 
05:20:44.810 --> 05:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
reduction act as with the infrastructure
 
05:20:46.250 --> 05:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
Bill the department will continue to
 
05:20:47.930 --> 05:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
monitor various funding opportunities as
 
05:20:49.850 --> 05:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
a result of this bill
 
05:20:51.708 --> 05:20:51.718 align:start position:0%
um just by way of context the U.S
 
05:20:53.150 --> 05:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
department of energies program guidance
 
05:20:54.830 --> 05:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
for these rebate programs is still in
 
05:20:57.530 --> 05:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
its early stages for context the
 
05:20:58.970 --> 05:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill which was signed
 
05:21:02.510 --> 05:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
into long of November of 2021 is just
 
05:21:04.250 --> 05:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
starting to Roll Out programs out of
 
05:21:07.190 --> 05:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
that bill now the IRA was just signed
 
05:21:09.948 --> 05:21:09.958 align:start position:0%
into law in August of last year so I
 
05:21:11.750 --> 05:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the guidance will take a
 
05:21:14.090 --> 05:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
little bit of time to develop I would
 
05:21:16.850 --> 05:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
note that the IRA does contain many uh
 
05:21:19.430 --> 05:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
tax related Provisions such uh maybe
 
05:21:21.410 --> 05:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
some tax credits that may assist
 
05:21:23.090 --> 05:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
homeowners with an Energy Efficiency
 
05:21:25.070 --> 05:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
Improvement a renewable energy project a
 
05:21:27.110 --> 05:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
clean vehicle purchase the department of
 
05:21:30.890 --> 05:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
energy is not a tax agency so if anybody
 
05:21:33.230 --> 05:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
hears from residents or constituents who
 
05:21:34.368 --> 05:21:34.378 align:start position:0%
are interested in those types of
 
05:21:36.410 --> 05:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
Provisions certainly encourage them to
 
05:21:39.288 --> 05:21:39.298 align:start position:0%
consult with a tax professional and then
 
05:21:41.090 --> 05:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
finally we do have some resources
 
05:21:43.368 --> 05:21:43.378 align:start position:0%
available on our website that we will
 
05:21:45.890 --> 05:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
continue to update regarding the IRA and
 
05:21:47.570 --> 05:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
feel free to contact us with any
 
05:21:47.580 --> 05:21:49.610 align:start position:0%
feel free to contact us with any
questions

05:21:49.610 --> 05:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:21:54.350 --> 05:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:57.170 --> 05:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
next presentation is on the state energy
 
05:22:00.000 --> 05:22:01.310 align:start position:0%
next presentation is on the state energy
strategy

05:22:01.310 --> 05:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
05:22:03.170 --> 05:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman I do realize we've
 
05:22:04.850 --> 05:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
already gone an hour already an hour and
 
05:22:06.890 --> 05:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
a half over our presentation time I
 
05:22:08.090 --> 05:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you wanted to defer
 
05:22:09.530 --> 05:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
talking about the state energy strategy
 
05:22:11.810 --> 05:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
to another time we do have I could go
 
05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
through the slides and discuss it or if
 
05:22:16.610 --> 05:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
you would prefer I'm happy to the the
 
05:22:18.590 --> 05:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
activities to go last portion of the
 
05:22:20.628 --> 05:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
presentation yes it is yeah
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
I think it might be worthwhile to defer
 
05:22:27.170 --> 05:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
this then okay and do it as a separate
 
05:22:28.550 --> 05:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
presentation because there's going to be
 
05:22:29.930 --> 05:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
so let's do this as a separate
 
05:22:34.910 --> 05:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
presentation uh later in the year okay
 
05:22:38.750 --> 05:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's how I know before we move on that
 
05:22:41.330 --> 05:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner Mr jucoin and the
 
05:22:43.550 --> 05:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Mr Elms have agreed
 
05:22:46.128 --> 05:22:46.138 align:start position:0%
to stay and answer additional questions
 
05:22:48.530 --> 05:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
if there are any
 
05:22:51.288 --> 05:22:51.298 align:start position:0%
do any of the members here have any
 
05:22:53.090 --> 05:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
additional questions for either the
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner or the Deputy Commissioner
 
05:22:59.150 --> 05:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
but one quick one representative Thomas
 
05:23:02.510 --> 05:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
Douglas Thomas thank you uh Mr chairman
 
05:23:05.690 --> 05:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh really quick uh
 
05:23:08.330 --> 05:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
we talked about fuels a little a little
 
05:23:10.850 --> 05:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
while ago I had heard
 
05:23:13.010 --> 05:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
some months ago that there was a fear
 
05:23:15.170 --> 05:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
that there could be a shortage of diesel
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
fuel in the area here can you speak to
 
05:23:19.610 --> 05:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
that if it ever materialized if we do
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
have it or what may be coming up down
 
05:23:23.810 --> 05:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
the line sure thank you representative
 
05:23:26.030 --> 05:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's a great question there was
 
05:23:26.040 --> 05:23:26.690 align:start position:0%
that's a great question there was
um

05:23:26.690 --> 05:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:29.448 --> 05:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
uh there were concerns about a diesel
 
05:23:29.458 --> 05:23:30.890 align:start position:0%
uh there were concerns about a diesel
shortage

05:23:30.890 --> 05:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
05:23:32.330 --> 05:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
um we were not necessarily involved in
 
05:23:34.850 --> 05:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
that conversation uh kerosene you may
 
05:23:35.930 --> 05:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
have heard
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
um there was a kerosene shortage a very
 
05:23:39.890 --> 05:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
real shortage
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
um where uh customers could not receive
 
05:23:45.230 --> 05:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
deliveries uh from their fuel vendor for
 
05:23:47.448 --> 05:23:47.458 align:start position:0%
kerosene that was a that was in October
 
05:23:50.330 --> 05:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
and uh early November problem and
 
05:23:52.670 --> 05:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
thankfully the supplies
 
05:23:56.628 --> 05:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
um are are back and kerosene is uh
 
05:23:56.638 --> 05:23:57.770 align:start position:0%
um are are back and kerosene is uh
available

05:23:57.770 --> 05:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:23:59.570 --> 05:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
um on diesel I would have to get back to
 
05:24:01.310 --> 05:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
you on where that's at but we've not
 
05:24:03.110 --> 05:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
received any
 
05:24:03.120 --> 05:24:03.890 align:start position:0%
received any
um

05:24:03.890 --> 05:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:05.810 --> 05:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
I should say any Outreach from the
 
05:24:07.010 --> 05:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
federal government for instance on that
 
05:24:07.020 --> 05:24:08.208 align:start position:0%
federal government for instance on that
issue

05:24:08.208 --> 05:24:08.218 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:24:12.830 --> 05:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:14.868 --> 05:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the gentleman
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
from the Department of energy
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
who I'm sure will be back to visit us in
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
the future representative Bernardi
 
05:24:23.628 --> 05:24:23.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so
 
05:24:31.128 --> 05:24:31.138 align:start position:0%
when we divided the distribution and the
 
05:24:31.138 --> 05:24:32.390 align:start position:0%
when we divided the distribution and the
production

05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
production
 
05:24:36.650 --> 05:24:36.660 align:start position:0%
uh of activities of utilities
 
05:24:40.850 --> 05:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
the distribution side obviously is still
 
05:24:43.368 --> 05:24:43.378 align:start position:0%
maintained as a public Monopoly and we
 
05:24:47.030 --> 05:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
we allow the uh you know those entities
 
05:24:49.368 --> 05:24:49.378 align:start position:0%
to operate that way
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
the distrib the production side however
 
05:24:54.770 --> 05:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
does not appear to be a public Monopoly
 
05:24:57.410 --> 05:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:25:01.250 --> 05:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
ultimately who is responsible for making
 
05:25:05.150 --> 05:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
sure there is sufficient production of
 
05:25:08.510 --> 05:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
electricity in the state is it the doe
 
05:25:11.270 --> 05:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
now is it I saw New England is it the
 
05:25:14.090 --> 05:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature or who owns
 
05:25:16.610 --> 05:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
that ISO New England our regional grid
 
05:25:18.350 --> 05:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
operator that is that is their
 
05:25:18.360 --> 05:25:19.910 align:start position:0%
operator that is that is their
responsibility

05:25:19.910 --> 05:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
05:25:22.190 --> 05:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
representative Loki has a question uh
 
05:25:26.628 --> 05:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I've asked this
 
05:25:29.150 --> 05:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
question in other forums in other ways
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
but for me as a member of this committee
 
05:25:35.690 --> 05:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
it would be very useful for me to have
 
05:25:38.510 --> 05:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
an idea of how much energy is consumed
 
05:25:41.090 --> 05:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
in the state in what forms probably on a
 
05:25:42.770 --> 05:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
month by month basis just to have an
 
05:25:44.208 --> 05:25:44.218 align:start position:0%
idea how much we're using for heating
 
05:25:46.910 --> 05:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
how much of whatever fuels we're using
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
to generate electricity and so on and uh
 
05:25:51.350 --> 05:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know I I'm certainly not asking for
 
05:25:53.330 --> 05:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
an answer now I think but this would be
 
05:25:55.490 --> 05:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
something very useful because we focused
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
on most of the time here on electricity
 
05:25:59.570 --> 05:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
and you know just looking out the window
 
05:26:01.670 --> 05:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
I can see an awful lot of energy going
 
05:26:04.750 --> 05:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
up chimneys and how does that compare is
 
05:26:07.788 --> 05:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
all the various forms and you know as I
 
05:26:08.930 --> 05:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
say it's the kind of thing that would
 
05:26:10.490 --> 05:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
probably take somebody some work to put
 
05:26:12.410 --> 05:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
together rather than trying to do it on
 
05:26:13.310 --> 05:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
the Fly
 
05:26:15.530 --> 05:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
sure uh it's a great question there's an
 
05:26:17.270 --> 05:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
awful lot of good data on the U.S
 
05:26:18.590 --> 05:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
department of Energy's Energy
 
05:26:21.890 --> 05:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
Information Administration website that
 
05:26:23.930 --> 05:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
does have you know information on the
 
05:26:25.730 --> 05:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
resource mix of our electricity
 
05:26:27.948 --> 05:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
generation on you know building and
 
05:26:30.530 --> 05:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh Energy Information our
 
05:26:32.990 --> 05:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
team uh if you reach out to Griffin uh
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
he can you know help uh you know respond
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
to inquiries and also provide some of
 
05:26:39.650 --> 05:26:39.660 align:start position:0%
those resources to you the iso New
 
05:26:41.390 --> 05:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
England uh when they come in they might
 
05:26:44.150 --> 05:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
also have a little bit more
 
05:26:46.910 --> 05:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
um granular data or information that
 
05:26:48.350 --> 05:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
they might be able to provide a lot of
 
05:26:50.810 --> 05:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
what we see is uh on a longer time
 
05:26:52.610 --> 05:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
Horizon say over the course of a year
 
05:26:55.128 --> 05:26:55.138 align:start position:0%
but for those uh more specific
 
05:26:56.930 --> 05:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
month-to-month flows they might have
 
05:27:00.288 --> 05:27:00.298 align:start position:0%
some more resources or information
 
05:27:02.690 --> 05:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay and you know I'm looking
 
05:27:04.788 --> 05:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
more specifically at New Hampshire I've
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
looked at eia's site and it gives us
 
05:27:09.170 --> 05:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
Nationwide data but uh
 
05:27:11.390 --> 05:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire not uh the whole
 
05:27:14.030 --> 05:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
country and so knowing what the whole
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
country is doing doesn't tell us what's
 
05:27:16.850 --> 05:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire in a given
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
time period thank you okay
 
05:27:22.730 --> 05:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
I believe the eia website does break it
 
05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
down by state as well representative
 
05:27:27.530 --> 05:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
Nutter has a question
 
05:27:30.170 --> 05:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
what's more of a comment um Mr chairman
 
05:27:31.550 --> 05:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
if that's all right
 
05:27:35.090 --> 05:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
um the iso to go app is is on every good
 
05:27:37.550 --> 05:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
nerd in geek's phone and it gives the
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the fuel being used right
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:48.470 --> 05:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions
 
05:27:51.050 --> 05:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
seeing none I would like to offer my
 
05:27:53.448 --> 05:27:53.458 align:start position:0%
personal and professional thanks to the
 
05:27:55.628 --> 05:27:55.638 align:start position:0%
Department of energy for an excellent
 
05:27:58.610 --> 05:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
detailed presentation we appreciate all
 
05:28:01.190 --> 05:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
the work that all of your employees put
 
05:28:03.470 --> 05:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
in to put together this presentation
 
05:28:06.288 --> 05:28:06.298 align:start position:0%
and we'll look forward to a presentation
 
05:28:08.930 --> 05:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
on the state energy strategy at some
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
time in the future and I'm sure we'll be
 
05:28:13.970 --> 05:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
getting visits from both of you as we
 
05:28:16.010 --> 05:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
get into the bill hearing process going
 
05:28:18.230 --> 05:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
forward so thanks again and we
 
05:28:19.788 --> 05:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here thank you for
 
05:28:21.288 --> 05:28:21.298 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
05:28:25.250 --> 05:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
we are going to uh press right into the
 
05:28:27.708 --> 05:28:27.718 align:start position:0%
next presenter if that's okay with
 
05:28:27.718 --> 05:28:28.788 align:start position:0%
next presenter if that's okay with
everybody

05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
05:28:32.510 --> 05:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
rather than take a break it's getting uh
 
05:28:35.390 --> 05:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
on in the day so we'd like to call on
 
05:28:37.910 --> 05:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
the office of the consumer advocate
 
05:28:41.330 --> 05:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
and Mr Donald crease to speak to us
 
05:28:41.340 --> 05:28:43.190 align:start position:0%
and Mr Donald crease to speak to us
about

05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:28:46.550 --> 05:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
his role in state government what his
 
05:28:49.010 --> 05:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
office does and
 
05:28:51.350 --> 05:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sure he will do so in a manner that
 
05:28:53.170 --> 05:28:53.180 align:start position:0%
is extremely
 
05:28:55.788 --> 05:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
entertaining for everyone
 
05:28:57.350 --> 05:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
so I'll
 
05:28:59.390 --> 05:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
we have a minute while he gets his
 
05:29:01.550 --> 05:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
computer set up I'll remind everybody
 
05:29:05.208 --> 05:29:05.218 align:start position:0%
that after Mr priest's crease is done
 
05:29:07.670 --> 05:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
if we have time we're going to go over
 
05:29:11.288 --> 05:29:11.298 align:start position:0%
some of the additional materials that we
 
05:29:13.610 --> 05:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
started to give you this morning at nine
 
05:29:16.550 --> 05:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
o'clock but ran out of time to finish
 
05:29:18.708 --> 05:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
if we don't have time today then we'll
 
05:29:22.368 --> 05:29:22.378 align:start position:0%
move forward with that at our next
 
05:29:25.490 --> 05:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
session which will be on Tuesday
 
05:29:25.500 --> 05:29:27.310 align:start position:0%
session which will be on Tuesday
January

05:29:27.310 --> 05:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
January
 
05:29:37.550 --> 05:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:40.430 --> 05:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
okay Mr crease it's all yours
 
05:29:42.770 --> 05:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
05:29:44.208 --> 05:29:44.218 align:start position:0%
of the committee it's a great pleasure
 
05:29:47.270 --> 05:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
to be here with you today uh my name is
 
05:29:50.330 --> 05:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
Donald crease I am the state's consumer
 
05:29:53.150 --> 05:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
Advocate and my slide presentation as I
 
05:29:55.310 --> 05:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
go through it we'll tell you almost
 
05:29:56.810 --> 05:29:56.820 align:start position:0%
everything you need to know about who I
 
05:30:00.770 --> 05:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
am what I do and what I uh what I think
 
05:30:04.730 --> 05:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
um I had a similar honor two years ago
 
05:30:06.770 --> 05:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh to sort of introduce myself to the
 
05:30:09.170 --> 05:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
committee and uh give a sense of the
 
05:30:11.448 --> 05:30:11.458 align:start position:0%
world according to me and and I started
 
05:30:13.610 --> 05:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
out by insisting that everything I was
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
going to say was going to be completely
 
05:30:17.628 --> 05:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
objective and factual and uh full of
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
actionable information and then I went
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
through my presentation and I recall uh
 
05:30:23.628 --> 05:30:23.638 align:start position:0%
chairman vo saying at the end of it well
 
05:30:25.430 --> 05:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's very interesting and insightful
 
05:30:28.010 --> 05:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
but just so you know it's the uh it's
 
05:30:30.708 --> 05:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
one person's View and I I think I might
 
05:30:31.910 --> 05:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
have said some things about some of the
 
05:30:33.288 --> 05:30:33.298 align:start position:0%
utilities that maybe some people
 
05:30:35.628 --> 05:30:35.638 align:start position:0%
disagreed with this time I'm really
 
05:30:38.990 --> 05:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to try to be as objective and
 
05:30:41.810 --> 05:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
absolutely unassailably true as I
 
05:30:44.030 --> 05:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
possibly can and I don't think I have
 
05:30:45.470 --> 05:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
anything mean to say about any of the
 
05:30:50.208 --> 05:30:50.218 align:start position:0%
utilities uh today okay I I just want to
 
05:30:53.030 --> 05:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
sort of level set and uh maybe for the
 
05:30:55.010 --> 05:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
benefit of those of you who are new and
 
05:30:56.930 --> 05:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
might have been completely vexed and
 
05:30:58.550 --> 05:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
confused by some of what you have
 
05:31:00.410 --> 05:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
already heard today I just want to level
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
set a little bit by going through some
 
05:31:04.730 --> 05:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
of the basic principles that drive what
 
05:31:07.250 --> 05:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
what I do and what the Public Utilities
 
05:31:09.110 --> 05:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
Commission do and what my friends at the
 
05:31:10.850 --> 05:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
department of energy do and what my
 
05:31:12.530 --> 05:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
friends at the Federal Energy Regulatory
 
05:31:16.250 --> 05:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
Commission do uh as you've already heard
 
05:31:18.770 --> 05:31:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh public utilities are regulated
 
05:31:21.050 --> 05:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
monopolies and the that's because these
 
05:31:23.030 --> 05:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
Network Industries are considered
 
05:31:24.770 --> 05:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
natural monopolies it would be very
 
05:31:27.230 --> 05:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
economically inefficient and therefore
 
05:31:29.690 --> 05:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
expensive to allow there to be two
 
05:31:31.850 --> 05:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
electricity distribution grids or two
 
05:31:34.550 --> 05:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
Interstate pipeline networks so we limit
 
05:31:38.030 --> 05:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
them to one system and we don't let them
 
05:31:39.230 --> 05:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
charge whatever they want because
 
05:31:42.288 --> 05:31:42.298 align:start position:0%
monopolists can extract Monopoly rents
 
05:31:44.810 --> 05:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
from the economy meaning they can charge
 
05:31:46.670 --> 05:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
prices that are in excess of what's
 
05:31:49.610 --> 05:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
economically efficient so we try to
 
05:31:51.770 --> 05:31:51.780 align:start position:0%
regulate the terms and conditions of
 
05:31:54.350 --> 05:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
service particularly the prices or rates
 
05:31:58.190 --> 05:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
and at the state level the uh entity
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
that is delegated with that
 
05:32:01.610 --> 05:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
responsibility from the legislature is
 
05:32:03.590 --> 05:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission and the
 
05:32:06.050 --> 05:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
idea is to set rates at exactly where
 
05:32:08.270 --> 05:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
they would be if we actually had a
 
05:32:11.690 --> 05:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
competitive market in those services so
 
05:32:14.390 --> 05:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
by Statute the general court has defined
 
05:32:17.090 --> 05:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
the puc as the Arbiter between the
 
05:32:19.310 --> 05:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
interests of customers and the interests
 
05:32:22.610 --> 05:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
of utilities and and by utilities I
 
05:32:23.990 --> 05:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
think we really mean the owners or
 
05:32:26.208 --> 05:32:26.218 align:start position:0%
shareholders of the utilities so so you
 
05:32:28.910 --> 05:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
have the puc as this giant scale is the
 
05:32:31.368 --> 05:32:31.378 align:start position:0%
way I think of it and I I can tell you
 
05:32:33.410 --> 05:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
in case you don't already know that the
 
05:32:35.150 --> 05:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
state's public utilities are extremely
 
05:32:37.190 --> 05:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
well represented at the Public Utilities
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
Commission they have regulatory teams
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
and really awesome lawyers and other
 
05:32:44.690 --> 05:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
experts the department of energy as
 
05:32:46.010 --> 05:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
you've already heard this morning which
 
05:32:49.128 --> 05:32:49.138 align:start position:0%
represents the executive branch and
 
05:32:51.530 --> 05:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
therefore the state I guess as a
 
05:32:53.628 --> 05:32:53.638 align:start position:0%
sovereign entity it also has a fair
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
amount of resources and the legislature
 
05:32:57.470 --> 05:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
therefore decided that maybe it would be
 
05:32:59.270 --> 05:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
a good idea to put a little weight on
 
05:33:02.330 --> 05:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
the scale that Arbiter scale on the side
 
05:33:05.868 --> 05:33:05.878 align:start position:0%
of uh customers and so therefore for the
 
05:33:08.150 --> 05:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
legislature back in the 1970s created
 
05:33:10.730 --> 05:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
what has now over time become the office
 
05:33:13.368 --> 05:33:13.378 align:start position:0%
of the consumer Advocate there are
 
05:33:16.190 --> 05:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
or there is such an entity of one kind
 
05:33:18.770 --> 05:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
or another in almost every state not
 
05:33:20.150 --> 05:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
every state there are a few that don't
 
05:33:22.550 --> 05:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
have any but Most states do they're set
 
05:33:24.170 --> 05:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
up a little differently in every state
 
05:33:27.050 --> 05:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh my counterpart in Maine the public
 
05:33:29.868 --> 05:33:29.878 align:start position:0%
Advocate is tasked with representing all
 
05:33:31.970 --> 05:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
rate payers our office represents only
 
05:33:34.970 --> 05:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers uh in the state
 
05:33:36.590 --> 05:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
to the South whose name I won't mention
 
05:33:38.868 --> 05:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
but whose initials are Massachusetts my
 
05:33:41.628 --> 05:33:41.638 align:start position:0%
counterpart works for the Attorney
 
05:33:43.970 --> 05:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
General Connecticut has an independent
 
05:33:46.610 --> 05:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
rate payer Advocate like me so it it
 
05:33:49.430 --> 05:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
varies but the the the concept is the
 
05:33:52.128 --> 05:33:52.138 align:start position:0%
same uh a little weight on the rate
 
05:33:54.350 --> 05:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
payer scale and given the solicitude
 
05:33:56.750 --> 05:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
that I've heard for ratepayers here
 
05:34:00.530 --> 05:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
today uh I I think of this committee and
 
05:34:02.570 --> 05:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
really the legislature in general as an
 
05:34:06.170 --> 05:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
ally in that task so uh that's a picture
 
05:34:08.090 --> 05:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
of the Walker building in case any of
 
05:34:09.830 --> 05:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
you have never seen it you hopefully
 
05:34:11.330 --> 05:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
will all have a chance to come by and
 
05:34:14.510 --> 05:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
visit us that is where the the Public
 
05:34:16.550 --> 05:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission the department of
 
05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
energy and our office are all located
 
05:34:21.350 --> 05:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's a really nice building my office
 
05:34:24.230 --> 05:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
the OCA is independent of the Public
 
05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission I do not report to
 
05:34:29.030 --> 05:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the puc we are
 
05:34:30.948 --> 05:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
independent of the Department of energy
 
05:34:33.530 --> 05:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
and you heard commissioner shacoin
 
05:34:35.868 --> 05:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
correctly point out that I do not report
 
05:34:38.208 --> 05:34:38.218 align:start position:0%
to him and as he also noted we are
 
05:34:40.610 --> 05:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
05:34:42.890 --> 05:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
Department of energy pursuant to RSA
 
05:34:46.910 --> 05:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
21g10 that does engender some confusion
 
05:34:49.550 --> 05:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes because people therefore think
 
05:34:51.110 --> 05:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm part of the Department of
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
energy or part of the puc but
 
05:34:55.310 --> 05:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
administrative attachment is really just
 
05:34:58.190 --> 05:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
about those back office functions that
 
05:35:00.230 --> 05:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner shacoin mentioned and they
 
05:35:03.050 --> 05:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
are very helpful to us when it comes to
 
05:35:06.050 --> 05:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
budget questions and money questions and
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
Logistics and you know all of that kind
 
05:35:10.970 --> 05:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
of stuff but but really I really and
 
05:35:12.948 --> 05:35:12.958 align:start position:0%
truly don't report to any of those
 
05:35:14.090 --> 05:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
people and there therefore they don't
 
05:35:15.708 --> 05:35:15.718 align:start position:0%
get any of the blame for what I do
 
05:35:15.718 --> 05:35:17.448 align:start position:0%
get any of the blame for what I do
either

05:35:17.448 --> 05:35:17.458 align:start position:0%
either
 
05:35:19.610 --> 05:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
a little bit about me since some of you
 
05:35:21.590 --> 05:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
are just meeting me for the first time
 
05:35:24.410 --> 05:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
I'm a lawyer and my statute says that I
 
05:35:26.150 --> 05:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
have to be a lawyer admitted to the
 
05:35:28.910 --> 05:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
practice here in New Hampshire I used to
 
05:35:30.590 --> 05:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
be the general counsel of the Public
 
05:35:33.708 --> 05:35:33.718 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission I spent a a little
 
05:35:36.948 --> 05:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
while as a hearing officer at the puc in
 
05:35:39.948 --> 05:35:39.958 align:start position:0%
Vermont I have worked as a law professor
 
05:35:41.810 --> 05:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
at Vermont law school and I still teach
 
05:35:44.750 --> 05:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
there as an adjunct I'm very proud of
 
05:35:47.448 --> 05:35:47.458 align:start position:0%
the fact that to my knowledge I am the
 
05:35:50.570 --> 05:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
only person who has ever held my job to
 
05:35:53.510 --> 05:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
have been nominated by a governor of
 
05:35:55.970 --> 05:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
each of the two major political parties
 
05:35:58.128 --> 05:35:58.138 align:start position:0%
and while I mentioned in Governors
 
05:36:01.010 --> 05:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
Hassan and sununu I do want to say that
 
05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
both of the governors those governors
 
05:36:06.948 --> 05:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
have taken great care to treat me as an
 
05:36:09.170 --> 05:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
independent actor neither of them and
 
05:36:11.390 --> 05:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
certainly not Governor sununu have ever
 
05:36:13.910 --> 05:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
purported to try to oversee me or tell
 
05:36:16.190 --> 05:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
me what I ought to do or what I ought
 
05:36:18.350 --> 05:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
not to do that's said we try to keep
 
05:36:20.208 --> 05:36:20.218 align:start position:0%
very good relations with whatever
 
05:36:23.390 --> 05:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
Governor happens to be in office and I I
 
05:36:24.590 --> 05:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
do think that I have an excellent
 
05:36:25.850 --> 05:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
relationship with the Department of
 
05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
energy they've been very kind to
 
05:36:30.708 --> 05:36:30.718 align:start position:0%
literally extend an open door to me so
 
05:36:32.868 --> 05:36:32.878 align:start position:0%
my key card gets me right into the
 
05:36:34.550 --> 05:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
Executive Suite at the department of
 
05:36:37.128 --> 05:36:37.138 align:start position:0%
energy and uh I have been known to do
 
05:36:39.050 --> 05:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
that from time to time so I was first
 
05:36:41.208 --> 05:36:41.218 align:start position:0%
appointed in 2016 by Governor Hassan
 
05:36:42.970 --> 05:36:42.980 align:start position:0%
that I was reappointed by Governor
 
05:36:46.730 --> 05:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
sununu almost four years ago and my
 
05:36:48.830 --> 05:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
current term expires in November and I
 
05:36:51.410 --> 05:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
have recently announced to my Advisory
 
05:36:53.930 --> 05:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
board that I will in fact be seeking a
 
05:36:56.030 --> 05:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
third term when my current term expires
 
05:36:58.490 --> 05:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
if you look up our statute you'll see
 
05:37:00.410 --> 05:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
that The Advisory Board of the
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
residential ratepayers Advisory Board
 
05:37:05.930 --> 05:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
serves as a kind of a gatekeeper in that
 
05:37:08.270 --> 05:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
in order for me to be reappointed I have
 
05:37:11.448 --> 05:37:11.458 align:start position:0%
to first convince them to so recommend
 
05:37:14.208 --> 05:37:14.218 align:start position:0%
to Governor sununu so I'm hoping they
 
05:37:16.250 --> 05:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
will do that sometime around mid-summer
 
05:37:18.110 --> 05:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
and then it will be up to the governor
 
05:37:19.910 --> 05:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
to decide and should he decide to
 
05:37:22.250 --> 05:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
re-nominate me then of course my name
 
05:37:24.788 --> 05:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
would go before the executive Council
 
05:37:28.310 --> 05:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
I have a very small staff of five people
 
05:37:32.270 --> 05:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
including me I have a legal assistant I
 
05:37:34.788 --> 05:37:34.798 align:start position:0%
have a staff attorney who I just hired I
 
05:37:38.390 --> 05:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
I the climate for state employees and
 
05:37:40.788 --> 05:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
the by which I mean the job market is
 
05:37:42.530 --> 05:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
very challenging these days so
 
05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
essentially I lost my whole staff to
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
employers that offered more lucrative
 
05:37:49.670 --> 05:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions than I could but I
 
05:37:51.410 --> 05:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
just hired a new staff attorney and he
 
05:37:53.868 --> 05:37:53.878 align:start position:0%
will be starting later this month and
 
05:37:55.730 --> 05:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
I'm still looking for a director of
 
05:37:57.830 --> 05:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
rates and Market policy and a director
 
05:38:00.770 --> 05:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
of economics and finance and if you
 
05:38:02.930 --> 05:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
happen to know anybody who would be good
 
05:38:04.750 --> 05:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
at doing either of those two things
 
05:38:07.788 --> 05:38:07.798 align:start position:0%
please let me know and I would be happy
 
05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
to reach out to them that's a photograph
 
05:38:12.170 --> 05:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
of my office which is extremely messy
 
05:38:14.390 --> 05:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
and so therefore you can tell that I'm
 
05:38:16.970 --> 05:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
super busy or I hope that's what the I
 
05:38:18.230 --> 05:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
hope that's the message that you get
 
05:38:20.590 --> 05:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
from the picture of my office
 
05:38:23.628 --> 05:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
as you have already heard the standard
 
05:38:26.750 --> 05:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
under state law law for where rates
 
05:38:29.208 --> 05:38:29.218 align:start position:0%
should fall is the famous and
 
05:38:31.690 --> 05:38:31.700 align:start position:0%
well-established just and reasonable
 
05:38:34.250 --> 05:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
standard so that's what the statute says
 
05:38:36.350 --> 05:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
but the Constitution by which I mean
 
05:38:38.350 --> 05:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
principally the Federal Constitution
 
05:38:41.510 --> 05:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
also has a lot to say about this because
 
05:38:44.990 --> 05:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a flaw on how low
 
05:38:48.590 --> 05:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
rates can go and that floor has to do
 
05:38:50.448 --> 05:38:50.458 align:start position:0%
with the Fifth Amendment to the U.S
 
05:38:52.430 --> 05:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution which has analogous
 
05:38:54.590 --> 05:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
language in the State Constitution which
 
05:38:56.690 --> 05:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
says that you cannot take the government
 
05:38:59.690 --> 05:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
cannot take private property for public
 
05:39:03.650 --> 05:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
use without just compensation and there
 
05:39:06.830 --> 05:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
is established case law that says that
 
05:39:10.788 --> 05:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
if you set rates so low as to deprive a
 
05:39:13.788 --> 05:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
public utility of an opportunity to earn
 
05:39:16.970 --> 05:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
a reasonable return on its shareholders
 
05:39:19.070 --> 05:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
investment then you have set rates that
 
05:39:21.410 --> 05:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
are quote unquote confiscatory meaning
 
05:39:24.650 --> 05:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
it virtually confiscates their property
 
05:39:27.230 --> 05:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
for public use without offering them
 
05:39:30.650 --> 05:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
providing them with just compensation
 
05:39:34.128 --> 05:39:34.138 align:start position:0%
and if you do that the utilities will go
 
05:39:36.288 --> 05:39:36.298 align:start position:0%
to federal courts sue you and win I just
 
05:39:38.030 --> 05:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
read in the paper today in fact that
 
05:39:39.708 --> 05:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
there's a bill in the Connecticut
 
05:39:42.708 --> 05:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
legislature to have the legislature
 
05:39:44.810 --> 05:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
rather than their utility regulator set
 
05:39:47.270 --> 05:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
utility rates for electricity at least
 
05:39:51.110 --> 05:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
and uh that's fine because rate setting
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
Authority is a legislative act that's
 
05:39:56.330 --> 05:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
delegated by legislatures but you if you
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
were to retain that Authority or reclaim
 
05:40:01.788 --> 05:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
that Authority from the puc and you
 
05:40:03.410 --> 05:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
decided that the utility rates were just
 
05:40:05.930 --> 05:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
too expensive for your constituents to
 
05:40:08.690 --> 05:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
sustain you you have to be aware that if
 
05:40:11.530 --> 05:40:11.540 align:start position:0%
you set rates at a confiscatory level
 
05:40:13.368 --> 05:40:13.378 align:start position:0%
the rates would be declared
 
05:40:15.470 --> 05:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional likely in a federal
 
05:40:17.930 --> 05:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
court so if you're a fan of Supreme
 
05:40:20.930 --> 05:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
Court jurisprudence I recommend a look
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
at the Supreme Court opinion of 1944
 
05:40:25.490 --> 05:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
called Federal power commission versus
 
05:40:28.610 --> 05:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
hope natural gas company and that is
 
05:40:30.530 --> 05:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
where the court opined about this Quest
 
05:40:34.610 --> 05:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
version of what is a fair return on
 
05:40:37.250 --> 05:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
shareholder investment for utilities and
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
as you can see the court said and I
 
05:40:40.610 --> 05:40:40.620 align:start position:0%
think every Economist I've ever met
 
05:40:43.310 --> 05:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
would agree that really return marches
 
05:40:46.010 --> 05:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
in lockstep with risk so what does that
 
05:40:48.770 --> 05:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
mean well it means that if you take your
 
05:40:51.170 --> 05:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
next paycheck and deposit it at your
 
05:40:52.670 --> 05:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
credit union you will probably
 
05:40:55.310 --> 05:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
reasonably expect a very low interest
 
05:40:59.948 --> 05:40:59.958 align:start position:0%
rate if you took that same paycheck and
 
05:41:02.448 --> 05:41:02.458 align:start position:0%
invested it in a pharmaceutical company
 
05:41:06.230 --> 05:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
that is working on highly experimental
 
05:41:08.990 --> 05:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
but maybe breakthrough drug therapies
 
05:41:11.150 --> 05:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
you would expect a much higher rate of
 
05:41:13.310 --> 05:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
return because those Investments are
 
05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
very very risky much of many of them
 
05:41:20.150 --> 05:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't pan out utility risk is I guess
 
05:41:21.890 --> 05:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the middle I tend to think
 
05:41:24.110 --> 05:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
of utilities as relatively low risk
 
05:41:25.670 --> 05:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
after all
 
05:41:27.530 --> 05:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
they provide essential public services
 
05:41:30.770 --> 05:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
and their customers are captive
 
05:41:34.368 --> 05:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
uh we are fortunate in New Hampshire to
 
05:41:37.430 --> 05:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
have given the world uh David souter the
 
05:41:40.010 --> 05:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
former U.S Supreme Court Justice back
 
05:41:41.810 --> 05:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
when he was a Justice of the New
 
05:41:44.628 --> 05:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court in 1988 he
 
05:41:46.910 --> 05:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
authored uh what I think is my very
 
05:41:49.368 --> 05:41:49.378 align:start position:0%
favorite appellate opinion about energy
 
05:41:52.150 --> 05:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
law and electric rates
 
05:41:54.470 --> 05:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
and there it is appeal of Public Service
 
05:41:56.810 --> 05:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
Company of New Hampshire 1988 and in
 
05:41:59.868 --> 05:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
that decision he observed that just
 
05:42:02.810 --> 05:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
because utilities are entitled to an
 
05:42:04.788 --> 05:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity to earn a reasonable return
 
05:42:07.550 --> 05:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
on shareholder investment it does not
 
05:42:07.560 --> 05:42:08.628 align:start position:0%
on shareholder investment it does not
mean

05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
mean
 
05:42:11.270 --> 05:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
that the shareholders are entitled to
 
05:42:13.150 --> 05:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
what he described as plenary
 
05:42:16.070 --> 05:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
indemnification and you know there was
 
05:42:17.868 --> 05:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
his reasoning the ultimate consequence
 
05:42:20.750 --> 05:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
of automatically raising the return as
 
05:42:22.310 --> 05:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
the prospects for recovering the
 
05:42:24.470 --> 05:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
investment fell would be nothing less
 
05:42:27.410 --> 05:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
than a shifting of the entire risk from
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
the investors to the ratepayers never a
 
05:42:33.050 --> 05:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
truer sentence about utility regulation
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
has ever been written and I am
 
05:42:37.310 --> 05:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
constantly telling law students that
 
05:42:40.610 --> 05:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
they must read David suiter's opinion in
 
05:42:43.190 --> 05:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
appeal of Public Service Company of New
 
05:42:43.200 --> 05:42:44.050 align:start position:0%
appeal of Public Service Company of New
Hampshire

05:42:44.050 --> 05:42:44.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:42:47.030 --> 05:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh you have heard other people explain
 
05:42:49.010 --> 05:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
this to you already today and of course
 
05:42:51.410 --> 05:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
my old friend Tom Frantz knows way more
 
05:42:54.230 --> 05:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
about this than I do uh here's a
 
05:42:57.288 --> 05:42:57.298 align:start position:0%
lawyer's view of what uh the current
 
05:43:00.050 --> 05:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
method for setting utility rates is and
 
05:43:01.850 --> 05:43:01.860 align:start position:0%
again these are these are regulated
 
05:43:04.670 --> 05:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
rates so I'm not talking about default
 
05:43:07.250 --> 05:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
Energy service because default Energy
 
05:43:09.830 --> 05:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
service is a rate that is really driven
 
05:43:11.510 --> 05:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
by what's available in the wholesale
 
05:43:13.850 --> 05:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
Marketplace competitive I'm talking
 
05:43:15.410 --> 05:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
about the other aspects of utility
 
05:43:18.230 --> 05:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
service that actually are set by the puc
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
and the puc does that by determining
 
05:43:23.208 --> 05:43:23.218 align:start position:0%
what the utilities annual revenue
 
05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
requirement is meaning how much money
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
should that utility take in over the
 
05:43:29.868 --> 05:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
course of one year and that amount of
 
05:43:31.788 --> 05:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
money is a sum of the utilities
 
05:43:35.948 --> 05:43:35.958 align:start position:0%
operating costs plus a
 
05:43:39.770 --> 05:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
multiple a multiple of its rate base so
 
05:43:42.310 --> 05:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
the present value of its capital assets
 
05:43:44.690 --> 05:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
multiplied by its weighted average cost
 
05:43:46.730 --> 05:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
of capital weighted average cost of
 
05:43:49.368 --> 05:43:49.378 align:start position:0%
capital is just a blended average of how
 
05:43:50.868 --> 05:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
much money they have to pay to their
 
05:43:55.128 --> 05:43:55.138 align:start position:0%
lenders for their borrowed money and how
 
05:43:57.470 --> 05:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
much return they ought to be able to
 
05:44:00.048 --> 05:44:00.058 align:start position:0%
return to their shareholders you create
 
05:44:01.850 --> 05:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
that weighted average you multiply it by
 
05:44:05.270 --> 05:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
the net uh the present value of their
 
05:44:07.548 --> 05:44:07.558 align:start position:0%
investment you get the return you add
 
05:44:09.110 --> 05:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
that to operating costs you come up with
 
05:44:11.090 --> 05:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
the revenue requirement that is only
 
05:44:14.690 --> 05:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
stage one of a rate case the second act
 
05:44:18.048 --> 05:44:18.058 align:start position:0%
is the rate design phase and that is the
 
05:44:20.030 --> 05:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
process whereby you divide that Revenue
 
05:44:23.090 --> 05:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
requirement among the various classes of
 
05:44:25.610 --> 05:44:25.620 align:start position:0%
customers and that is something we get
 
05:44:27.470 --> 05:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
terribly involved in because there are a
 
05:44:28.788 --> 05:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
lot of important issues that get
 
05:44:31.128 --> 05:44:31.138 align:start position:0%
resolved there the utilities conduct
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
cost of service studies to determine who
 
05:44:36.830 --> 05:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
is responsible for creating which costs
 
05:44:42.110 --> 05:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
that the utilities can uh incur uh rates
 
05:44:44.510 --> 05:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
have in them both fixed and variable
 
05:44:46.610 --> 05:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
charges so if you look at your electric
 
05:44:48.770 --> 05:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
bill everybody pays a fixed customer
 
05:44:52.730 --> 05:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
charge every month I think it eversource
 
05:44:55.190 --> 05:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's about 13 a month for a residential
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
customer that's supposed to cover the
 
05:44:59.390 --> 05:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
fixed costs that the utility incurs
 
05:45:01.548 --> 05:45:01.558 align:start position:0%
regardless of how much energy you use
 
05:45:04.610 --> 05:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
and then all of the other charges uh
 
05:45:07.250 --> 05:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
vary by how much energy you consume so
 
05:45:09.530 --> 05:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting uh it's an
 
05:45:11.090 --> 05:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
interesting question to figure out how
 
05:45:13.310 --> 05:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
to how to allocate costs between those
 
05:45:15.650 --> 05:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
two ends of the electric bill
 
05:45:18.650 --> 05:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
05:45:20.930 --> 05:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman what is social
 
05:45:20.940 --> 05:45:22.430 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman what is social
equity

05:45:22.430 --> 05:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
equity
 
05:45:25.310 --> 05:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh well social equity which is the next
 
05:45:29.330 --> 05:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
bullet point there has to do with uh
 
05:45:31.490 --> 05:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
whether it is appropriate in some
 
05:45:34.850 --> 05:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
circumstances to Veer away from or
 
05:45:38.510 --> 05:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
depart from the idea that rates should
 
05:45:41.750 --> 05:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
be driven purely by cost causation so a
 
05:45:44.930 --> 05:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
great example of that would be rates
 
05:45:46.788 --> 05:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
that are designed specifically for
 
05:45:49.490 --> 05:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
low-income customers to give them a
 
05:45:51.410 --> 05:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
break on their bill because they simply
 
05:45:53.930 --> 05:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
can't afford their electricity and we
 
05:45:56.628 --> 05:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
don't currently do that instead we have
 
05:45:58.850 --> 05:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
energy assistance programs that give
 
05:46:01.730 --> 05:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
them essentially a rebate but you can
 
05:46:03.590 --> 05:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
design rates that are especially for
 
05:46:06.530 --> 05:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
low-income customers there might be
 
05:46:08.330 --> 05:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of consumption that you
 
05:46:12.048 --> 05:46:12.058 align:start position:0%
want to encourage or discourage for
 
05:46:15.048 --> 05:46:15.058 align:start position:0%
policy reasons you can do that that's
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
what I mean by social Equity I I would
 
05:46:20.090 --> 05:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
say we're relatively less inclined than
 
05:46:22.190 --> 05:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions are to apply a lot
 
05:46:24.470 --> 05:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
of social Equity questions to our rate
 
05:46:26.750 --> 05:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
design but it is an established rate
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
design principle
 
05:46:29.520 --> 05:46:31.010 align:start position:0%
design principle
follow-up

05:46:31.010 --> 05:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:46:33.890 --> 05:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you so I I was wondering if it was
 
05:46:37.330 --> 05:46:37.340 align:start position:0%
synonymous with ESG
 
05:46:40.430 --> 05:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
ESG stands for
 
05:46:40.440 --> 05:46:42.708 align:start position:0%
ESG stands for
um

05:46:42.708 --> 05:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:44.948 --> 05:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
05:46:47.448 --> 05:46:47.458 align:start position:0%
potentially there is overlap between
 
05:46:49.070 --> 05:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
those two concepts but I wouldn't say
 
05:46:52.128 --> 05:46:52.138 align:start position:0%
that they're necessarily uh synonymous I
 
05:46:56.448 --> 05:46:56.458 align:start position:0%
mean you know again it's just one factor
 
05:46:59.868 --> 05:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
that can by the regulator be applied to
 
05:47:02.510 --> 05:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
rate design decisions I again I don't
 
05:47:04.490 --> 05:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
think we're doing a lot of that in New
 
05:47:06.530 --> 05:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now and I have never
 
05:47:09.350 --> 05:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
heard the initials ESG appear or never
 
05:47:11.868 --> 05:47:11.878 align:start position:0%
seen it seen those initials appear in
 
05:47:15.770 --> 05:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
any order of rpuc I think the much more
 
05:47:18.288 --> 05:47:18.298 align:start position:0%
significant issue in rate design has to
 
05:47:20.208 --> 05:47:20.218 align:start position:0%
do with making sure that customers get
 
05:47:22.430 --> 05:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
the right price signals so that we
 
05:47:25.730 --> 05:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
encourage them to consume when it's
 
05:47:28.128 --> 05:47:28.138 align:start position:0%
easier or cheaper to provide them with
 
05:47:30.230 --> 05:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
service and we discourage them from
 
05:47:33.230 --> 05:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
consuming when it gets more expensive
 
05:47:35.448 --> 05:47:35.458 align:start position:0%
for them to consume so if you think
 
05:47:37.610 --> 05:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
about electricity because demand for
 
05:47:39.650 --> 05:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
electricity is very low in the overnight
 
05:47:42.170 --> 05:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
it's generally very inexpensive to
 
05:47:44.510 --> 05:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
produce electricity in the overnight so
 
05:47:46.128 --> 05:47:46.138 align:start position:0%
inexpensive in fact that I've even seen
 
05:47:48.170 --> 05:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
wholesale prices go negative in the
 
05:47:51.170 --> 05:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
overnight so you might want to think
 
05:47:53.208 --> 05:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
about designing rates that encourage the
 
05:47:54.910 --> 05:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
use of electricity during those hours
 
05:47:58.368 --> 05:47:58.378 align:start position:0%
and discourage the use of electricity at
 
05:48:01.610 --> 05:48:01.620 align:start position:0%
5 PM why 5 PM well I'm pretty sure the
 
05:48:02.990 --> 05:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
Sun is going to go down this afternoon
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
at about 4 30 which means all the solar
 
05:48:08.270 --> 05:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
power will go offline everybody comes
 
05:48:11.930 --> 05:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
home from work and or school and
 
05:48:13.250 --> 05:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
everybody turns on all of their
 
05:48:15.650 --> 05:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
appliances and their lights and that
 
05:48:17.510 --> 05:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
creates a big bump in demand for
 
05:48:20.330 --> 05:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
electricity and so the cost of producing
 
05:48:23.690 --> 05:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
electricity goes up so again if we can
 
05:48:26.750 --> 05:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
send people price signals that make them
 
05:48:29.208 --> 05:48:29.218 align:start position:0%
think about that that is one approach to
 
05:48:32.270 --> 05:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
rate design now that may not be a good
 
05:48:34.610 --> 05:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
idea for residential customers because
 
05:48:37.910 --> 05:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
how many of us at dinner time are in a
 
05:48:39.590 --> 05:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
position to say oops we're going to shut
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
everything down but if you're a big
 
05:48:43.610 --> 05:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
industrial customer
 
05:48:45.288 --> 05:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
um it might make sense to send you price
 
05:48:47.750 --> 05:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
signals because you might be in a better
 
05:48:50.330 --> 05:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
position to adjust your consumption and
 
05:48:53.270 --> 05:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
thereby optimize your Revenue stream by
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
managing your electric uh your energy
 
05:48:58.970 --> 05:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
costs and thereby helping everybody save
 
05:49:02.270 --> 05:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
money by using energy when it's cheaper
 
05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
and using less energy when it is more
 
05:49:04.798 --> 05:49:06.048 align:start position:0%
and using less energy when it is more
expensive

05:49:06.048 --> 05:49:06.058 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
05:49:08.990 --> 05:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
so this is a slide I love to show
 
05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
because representative partial also has
 
05:49:13.368 --> 05:49:13.378 align:start position:0%
a question before you move on okay yes
 
05:49:15.410 --> 05:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chair for taking my question
 
05:49:18.830 --> 05:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
and hello Mr crease
 
05:49:21.048 --> 05:49:21.058 align:start position:0%
in order to meet that last price signal
 
05:49:22.490 --> 05:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
does that imply that we did something
 
05:49:25.548 --> 05:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
such as a smart meter in order to uh get
 
05:49:28.850 --> 05:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
down to that level of management yes uh
 
05:49:32.628 --> 05:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
we are uh doing our best at the OCA to
 
05:49:36.350 --> 05:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
nudge the utilities into the complete
 
05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
adoption of so-called smart meters and
 
05:49:41.150 --> 05:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
and really when I say smart meters I'm
 
05:49:43.010 --> 05:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
talking about what's referred to in the
 
05:49:45.650 --> 05:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
trade is Ami which stands for advanced
 
05:49:47.810 --> 05:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
metering infrastructure and what we're
 
05:49:51.410 --> 05:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
really looking for essentially is meters
 
05:49:56.810 --> 05:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
that can record what customers use on a
 
05:49:59.090 --> 05:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
granular basis so that the meter knows
 
05:50:01.128 --> 05:50:01.138 align:start position:0%
and reports back to the utility not just
 
05:50:03.590 --> 05:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
how much energy you used over the course
 
05:50:05.690 --> 05:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
of a month but how much energy you used
 
05:50:07.730 --> 05:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
in any particular hour or you can even
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
go down to 15 minutes or even even five
 
05:50:12.770 --> 05:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
minutes and since you mentioned meters I
 
05:50:14.930 --> 05:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
would like to say that in my respectful
 
05:50:17.690 --> 05:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
opinion the natural monopoly on meters
 
05:50:20.570 --> 05:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
is no longer there and there is no
 
05:50:23.270 --> 05:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
reason why our utilities have to be the
 
05:50:25.548 --> 05:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
only entities that are allowed to meter
 
05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
things there could be other providers of
 
05:50:33.048 --> 05:50:33.058 align:start position:0%
meters and as long as the meters meet
 
05:50:35.448 --> 05:50:35.458 align:start position:0%
the so-called utility grade standard
 
05:50:37.548 --> 05:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why the utility has to
 
05:50:40.368 --> 05:50:40.378 align:start position:0%
be the exclusive provider of that device
 
05:50:43.010 --> 05:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
to you
 
05:50:45.530 --> 05:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
um this is my favorite slide because I'm
 
05:50:47.330 --> 05:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
sure that I can give you the entire
 
05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
history of electricity in New Hampshire
 
05:50:52.970 --> 05:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
in one slide uh the driving force and
 
05:50:54.410 --> 05:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
the development of the electric industry
 
05:50:55.970 --> 05:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and in much of the
 
05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
country was a gentleman you may or may
 
05:51:00.890 --> 05:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
not have heard of named Samuel insul he
 
05:51:02.690 --> 05:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh back in the days before there was a
 
05:51:04.970 --> 05:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
lot of regulation of such things he
 
05:51:06.650 --> 05:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
built what was essentially a nationwide
 
05:51:08.750 --> 05:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
electricity Empire it was called
 
05:51:11.510 --> 05:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth Edison and it through a
 
05:51:13.250 --> 05:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
variety of holding companies and that
 
05:51:15.470 --> 05:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
sort of thing controlled every utility
 
05:51:16.910 --> 05:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
in the country that had the words Public
 
05:51:19.610 --> 05:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
Service in its name including Public
 
05:51:23.090 --> 05:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
Service Company of New Hampshire uh in
 
05:51:26.330 --> 05:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
the 1930s uh when Franklin Delano
 
05:51:29.390 --> 05:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt was elected and we tried our
 
05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
best to get the country out of the Great
 
05:51:33.288 --> 05:51:33.298 align:start position:0%
Depression there was some legal reforms
 
05:51:34.730 --> 05:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
in the form of the public utility
 
05:51:37.430 --> 05:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
holding company act which busted up the
 
05:51:40.510 --> 05:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth Edison Empire and made
 
05:51:43.548 --> 05:51:43.558 align:start position:0%
the utilities independent of each other
 
05:51:46.250 --> 05:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
again also importantly in the 1930s was
 
05:51:48.708 --> 05:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
the rural electrification act investor
 
05:51:50.750 --> 05:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
on utilities essentially refused to wire
 
05:51:53.448 --> 05:51:53.458 align:start position:0%
up Rural America and so in almost every
 
05:51:57.128 --> 05:51:57.138 align:start position:0%
state including ours a network of
 
05:51:59.150 --> 05:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
customer-owned electric cooperatives
 
05:52:01.730 --> 05:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
developed taking advantage of low
 
05:52:03.110 --> 05:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
interest loans from the federal
 
05:52:05.270 --> 05:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
government and that is why today we have
 
05:52:08.208 --> 05:52:08.218 align:start position:0%
our fourth electric utility being the
 
05:52:10.390 --> 05:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Electric Cooperative and
 
05:52:12.948 --> 05:52:12.958 align:start position:0%
they are very well worth keeping an eye
 
05:52:16.190 --> 05:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
on even though they have their members
 
05:52:19.788 --> 05:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
have exercised their statutory right to
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
file a so-called certificate of
 
05:52:23.810 --> 05:52:23.820 align:start position:0%
deregulation with the puc which means
 
05:52:26.330 --> 05:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
the puc doesn't set their rates the
 
05:52:29.930 --> 05:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
co-ops elected board of directors does
 
05:52:34.970 --> 05:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
so with the Arab Oil Embargo of uh 1973
 
05:52:38.510 --> 05:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
came a big change in Federal Energy law
 
05:52:41.090 --> 05:52:41.100 align:start position:0%
in particular and in 1978 President
 
05:52:43.788 --> 05:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
Carter signed a statute into law called
 
05:52:46.208 --> 05:52:46.218 align:start position:0%
purpa that's a great acronym stands for
 
05:52:51.670 --> 05:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh public utility uh public utility
 
05:52:54.910 --> 05:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory policies Act of
 
05:52:57.708 --> 05:52:57.718 align:start position:0%
1978. so I was really glad to hear
 
05:52:59.570 --> 05:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative Munns reminisce about his
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
time with wheelabrader because it turns
 
05:53:04.128 --> 05:53:04.138 align:start position:0%
out that because Wheelabrator was based
 
05:53:05.810 --> 05:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth New Hampshire at the time
 
05:53:08.930 --> 05:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
and because we had a senator named John
 
05:53:11.030 --> 05:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
Durkin who I think was on pretty good
 
05:53:13.090 --> 05:53:13.100 align:start position:0%
terms with the folks at Wheelabrator
 
05:53:16.368 --> 05:53:16.378 align:start position:0%
they incorporated into purple a
 
05:53:17.810 --> 05:53:17.820 align:start position:0%
provision in the statute it's section
 
05:53:20.270 --> 05:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
210 of purpa that for the very first
 
05:53:23.208 --> 05:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
time opened up the electricity grid to
 
05:53:26.330 --> 05:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
non-utility generators of electricity
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
and those non-utility generators of
 
05:53:32.030 --> 05:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
electricity were called qf's qualifying
 
05:53:34.010 --> 05:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
facilities what did you have to do to be
 
05:53:35.990 --> 05:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
a qualifying facility Well you had to
 
05:53:38.150 --> 05:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
look a lot like what the plants that
 
05:53:39.830 --> 05:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
Wheelabrator was operating look like
 
05:53:41.570 --> 05:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
meaning you had to be less than 80
 
05:53:43.850 --> 05:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
megawatts and you had to be using
 
05:53:46.850 --> 05:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
certain uh newer technologies that
 
05:53:49.250 --> 05:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
didn't rely on nuclear power or fossil
 
05:53:51.350 --> 05:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
fuel and I really think that if it
 
05:53:53.090 --> 05:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
wasn't for Wheelabrator and Senator
 
05:53:55.430 --> 05:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
Durkin that we wouldn't have had section
 
05:53:58.070 --> 05:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
210 of purpa and that is really what
 
05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
kind of opened the barn door to the
 
05:54:03.650 --> 05:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
generation of electricity by something
 
05:54:05.390 --> 05:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
other than vertically integrated
 
05:54:07.910 --> 05:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
utilities so you know a very very
 
05:54:10.490 --> 05:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
important development in the history of
 
05:54:12.548 --> 05:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
electricity in New Hampshire
 
05:54:15.350 --> 05:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's sometimes popular to claim that
 
05:54:16.910 --> 05:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
President Carter didn't accomplish
 
05:54:19.548 --> 05:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
anything in his four years in office but
 
05:54:21.170 --> 05:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
he certainly accomplished a lot in the
 
05:54:23.750 --> 05:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
realm of energy policy and I think purpa
 
05:54:25.490 --> 05:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
was a big deal
 
05:54:28.670 --> 05:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
I'm in 1988 here in New Hampshire we had
 
05:54:31.750 --> 05:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
what I like to refer to as the Big Bang
 
05:54:34.548 --> 05:54:34.558 align:start position:0%
meaning uh January I think it was
 
05:54:37.788 --> 05:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
January 26 1988 uh Public Service
 
05:54:39.830 --> 05:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
Company declared bankruptcy because it
 
05:54:42.288 --> 05:54:42.298 align:start position:0%
could not sustain the crippling burden
 
05:54:45.530 --> 05:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
of having to carry its uh investment in
 
05:54:48.830 --> 05:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
the Seabrook nuclear power plant uh that
 
05:54:51.590 --> 05:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
is a plant that was originally supposed
 
05:54:54.830 --> 05:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
to be what 2 400 megawatts of power and
 
05:54:57.590 --> 05:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
it was going to cost 150 million dollars
 
05:55:00.288 --> 05:55:00.298 align:start position:0%
when it was first rolled out it ended up
 
05:55:03.410 --> 05:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
costing 7.2 billion dollars one of the
 
05:55:05.868 --> 05:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
two units was canceled so we only have
 
05:55:08.390 --> 05:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
one unit at Seabrook and Seabrook did
 
05:55:11.270 --> 05:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
not go online until 1990 too late for
 
05:55:12.970 --> 05:55:12.980 align:start position:0%
Public Service Company of New Hampshire
 
05:55:15.650 --> 05:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
which sought bankruptcy protection in
 
05:55:19.250 --> 05:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
1988. that big bang resonated not just
 
05:55:21.708 --> 05:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
in the boardroom of PSNH and not just
 
05:55:24.230 --> 05:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
here at the state house but it resonated
 
05:55:26.448 --> 05:55:26.458 align:start position:0%
through the electricity bills of every
 
05:55:29.208 --> 05:55:29.218 align:start position:0%
customer of PSNH because it turns out
 
05:55:32.030 --> 05:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
that when your utility goes bankrupt it
 
05:55:34.730 --> 05:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
is bad for both the shareholders and the
 
05:55:37.368 --> 05:55:37.378 align:start position:0%
customers and in short order New
 
05:55:39.350 --> 05:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had the very highest
 
05:55:41.770 --> 05:55:41.780 align:start position:0%
electricity rates in the entire country
 
05:55:44.030 --> 05:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
that in turn
 
05:55:46.030 --> 05:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
led to the
 
05:55:48.830 --> 05:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
state's electric industry restructuring
 
05:55:53.150 --> 05:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
act adopted in 1996 which uh sort of
 
05:55:54.708 --> 05:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
dovetailed with the Federal Energy
 
05:55:58.250 --> 05:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
Policy Act of 1992 and those statutes
 
05:55:59.810 --> 05:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
were designed to open up the electric
 
05:56:02.270 --> 05:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
industry to competition the energy
 
05:56:04.610 --> 05:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
Policy Act focused on wholesale
 
05:56:07.070 --> 05:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
electricity and transmission and the
 
05:56:09.230 --> 05:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
restructuring Act of course focused on
 
05:56:12.110 --> 05:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
distribution and Retail Energy which is
 
05:56:14.350 --> 05:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
what the state regulates
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
it so the energy Policy Act led to the
 
05:56:19.788 --> 05:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
development of what we now know as ISO
 
05:56:22.628 --> 05:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
New England an independent grid operator
 
05:56:25.128 --> 05:56:25.138 align:start position:0%
and the restructuring act led to the
 
05:56:26.930 --> 05:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
restructuring of our electric industry
 
05:56:29.510 --> 05:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
and for reasons I'd be happy to tell you
 
05:56:31.070 --> 05:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
even though it would take more than one
 
05:56:31.080 --> 05:56:32.110 align:start position:0%
even though it would take more than one
slide

05:56:32.110 --> 05:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
slide
 
05:56:35.470 --> 05:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
restructuring took until 2018 to finish
 
05:56:38.810 --> 05:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
so finally in 2018 our utilities owned
 
05:56:40.788 --> 05:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
little or no of their own generation
 
05:56:42.948 --> 05:56:42.958 align:start position:0%
capacity and when they sell energy at
 
05:56:45.350 --> 05:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
retail to customers they have to buy it
 
05:56:47.330 --> 05:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
from wholesale providers
 
05:56:50.270 --> 05:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
without producing it themselves uh and
 
05:56:52.190 --> 05:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
then I I think and you know this has
 
05:56:54.410 --> 05:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
been alluded to as well a key
 
05:56:56.330 --> 05:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
development in the history of
 
05:56:58.070 --> 05:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
electricity in New Hampshire is actually
 
05:57:00.948 --> 05:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
a bunch of things that didn't happen in
 
05:57:02.868 --> 05:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
the last decade or so we did not build
 
05:57:05.990 --> 05:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass so we are not importing as
 
05:57:08.448 --> 05:57:08.458 align:start position:0%
much electricity from Hydro Quebec as we
 
05:57:10.490 --> 05:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
could we did not build the Northeast
 
05:57:12.410 --> 05:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
direct pipeline which would have brought
 
05:57:15.650 --> 05:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
more natural gas up from uh Pennsylvania
 
05:57:17.750 --> 05:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
essentially and we didn't build the
 
05:57:19.788 --> 05:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
excess Northeast project which was a
 
05:57:21.830 --> 05:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
similar project that likewise would have
 
05:57:24.230 --> 05:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
helped import more natural gas from
 
05:57:27.170 --> 05:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
Points West of New England
 
05:57:29.330 --> 05:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
and then of course we have the latest
 
05:57:31.970 --> 05:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
developments that are really
 
05:57:34.070 --> 05:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
um what we've seen in the last year or
 
05:57:36.048 --> 05:57:36.058 align:start position:0%
year and a half which is
 
05:57:38.930 --> 05:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
soaring rates for default Energy service
 
05:57:43.010 --> 05:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
especially this year uh we saw one of
 
05:57:44.270 --> 05:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
our utilities have to go all the way up
 
05:57:46.070 --> 05:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
to 26 Cents
 
05:57:49.128 --> 05:57:49.138 align:start position:0%
uh when for a good decade we have rate
 
05:57:51.288 --> 05:57:51.298 align:start position:0%
we had a default Energy Service rates in
 
05:57:54.170 --> 05:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
the 789 10 cent range so it's been a
 
05:57:57.110 --> 05:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
drastic increase and it has caused a
 
05:57:59.448 --> 05:57:59.458 align:start position:0%
great deal of I would say suffering and
 
05:58:01.128 --> 05:58:01.138 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that you've been hearing from
 
05:58:03.048 --> 05:58:03.058 align:start position:0%
your constituents about that kind of
 
05:58:03.058 --> 05:58:05.150 align:start position:0%
your constituents about that kind of
misery

05:58:05.150 --> 05:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
misery
 
05:58:07.310 --> 05:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
um a question that you get to Grapple
 
05:58:10.670 --> 05:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
with as state policy makers is what hang
 
05:58:12.170 --> 05:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
on a second before you go to your next
 
05:58:14.270 --> 05:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
slide representative Summers has a
 
05:58:16.788 --> 05:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh just a
 
05:58:18.048 --> 05:58:18.058 align:start position:0%
quick question for you on the history
 
05:58:19.850 --> 05:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
there based on it and I've been asked
 
05:58:21.770 --> 05:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
this many times I think I pretty much
 
05:58:23.150 --> 05:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
know the answer but please correct me if
 
05:58:24.948 --> 05:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong even though New Hampshire has
 
05:58:26.868 --> 05:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
its own nuclear power plant in Seabrook
 
05:58:30.350 --> 05:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
is it the cause or the reasoning of iso
 
05:58:32.448 --> 05:58:32.458 align:start position:0%
New England the reason why only 20 of
 
05:58:34.128 --> 05:58:34.138 align:start position:0%
the power that comes from Seabrook
 
05:58:37.250 --> 05:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
actually comes to New Hampshire
 
05:58:39.410 --> 05:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question and I I
 
05:58:41.628 --> 05:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
get asked a form of that question all
 
05:58:43.610 --> 05:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
the time with with default Energy
 
05:58:45.890 --> 05:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
service so high sometimes people ask me
 
05:58:47.930 --> 05:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
well we we have Seabrook in New
 
05:58:49.788 --> 05:58:49.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire why don't we just use that to
 
05:58:52.850 --> 05:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
serve our load and the answer is that I
 
05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
think it was in 1992 the U.S Supreme
 
05:58:58.970 --> 05:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
Court told New Hampshire that it could
 
05:59:02.330 --> 05:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
not do that it could not Reserve its
 
05:59:05.150 --> 05:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
in-state generation capacity for its own
 
05:59:07.490 --> 05:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
use that that case actually had to do
 
05:59:09.170 --> 05:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
with the dams on the Connecticut River
 
05:59:11.270 --> 05:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
but the same legal principle applies to
 
05:59:13.430 --> 05:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
Seabrook Seabrook is part of the
 
05:59:15.948 --> 05:59:15.958 align:start position:0%
regional electricity Grid it's owned by
 
05:59:18.410 --> 05:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
next era which is a company based down
 
05:59:20.270 --> 05:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
in Florida they bought the controlling
 
05:59:22.788 --> 05:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
interest from a Public Service Company
 
05:59:24.350 --> 05:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire they paid a Bargain
 
05:59:27.830 --> 05:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
Basement price for it and now they sell
 
05:59:30.708 --> 05:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
their output of Seabrook 1200 megawatts
 
05:59:33.708 --> 05:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
into the overall electricity grid now as
 
05:59:36.048 --> 05:59:36.058 align:start position:0%
it happens eversource is about to start
 
05:59:38.690 --> 05:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
relying on next era for its residential
 
05:59:41.208 --> 05:59:41.218 align:start position:0%
default Energy service so in a way we
 
05:59:43.730 --> 05:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
are using Seabrook but the owners of
 
05:59:45.910 --> 05:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
Seabrook are not a charitable Enterprise
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
and they participate in the market such
 
05:59:51.170 --> 05:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
that they get a market rate for the
 
05:59:53.930 --> 05:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
electricity that they generate so to the
 
05:59:56.270 --> 05:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
point about what you what data you can
 
05:59:58.208 --> 05:59:58.218 align:start position:0%
get from the Energy Information
 
06:00:00.830 --> 06:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
Administration about the electricity
 
06:00:02.570 --> 06:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
that we consume and produce in New
 
06:00:04.730 --> 06:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we can do that and that is
 
06:00:08.448 --> 06:00:08.458 align:start position:0%
available on the EI eia website but the
 
06:00:09.890 --> 06:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
caution the thing you have to keep in
 
06:00:14.628 --> 06:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
mind is that we don't only consume the
 
06:00:17.030 --> 06:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
electricity that we generate in New
 
06:00:19.548 --> 06:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so you'll see we produce a lot
 
06:00:20.810 --> 06:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
of nuclear power in New Hampshire
 
06:00:23.150 --> 06:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
because our biggest producer is Seabrook
 
06:00:26.090 --> 06:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
but we don't rely on that as our
 
06:00:28.330 --> 06:00:28.340 align:start position:0%
dominant source of electricity
 
06:00:31.490 --> 06:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there really is for
 
06:00:33.230 --> 06:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
purposes of the wholesale electricity
 
06:00:35.208 --> 06:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
Market no such thing as New Hampshire
 
06:00:37.850 --> 06:00:37.860 align:start position:0%
there's one big wholesale Market that
 
06:00:40.788 --> 06:00:40.798 align:start position:0%
covers all of New England
 
06:00:44.030 --> 06:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
okay so as I was about to say you as
 
06:00:46.310 --> 06:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
state policy makers have to Grapple with
 
06:00:49.368 --> 06:00:49.378 align:start position:0%
this question of what sphere belongs to
 
06:00:52.670 --> 06:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
the states and what's fear belongs to
 
06:00:55.730 --> 06:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
the federal government and the relevant
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
provisions of the Federal Constitution
 
06:00:59.448 --> 06:00:59.458 align:start position:0%
are the Commerce Clause and the
 
06:01:01.548 --> 06:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause the Commerce Clause
 
06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
says Congress may but does not have to
 
06:01:07.128 --> 06:01:07.138 align:start position:0%
regulate interstate commerce and the
 
06:01:10.010 --> 06:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause says that when Congress
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
acts within its sphere of authority and
 
06:01:16.490 --> 06:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
adopts law that law is the supreme law
 
06:01:19.070 --> 06:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
of the land and any state law that's
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with federal law is in
 
06:01:25.250 --> 06:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
legal parlance preempted so those two
 
06:01:27.350 --> 06:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
concepts Drive everything that we do
 
06:01:30.110 --> 06:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
with respect to Federal Energy law and
 
06:01:32.930 --> 06:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
its impact on state energy policy and
 
06:01:36.470 --> 06:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
law and on the electric side the
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
electricity is governed federally by the
 
06:01:41.330 --> 06:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
federal power act a statute it really
 
06:01:44.930 --> 06:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
dates in its present form to 1935 so
 
06:01:46.610 --> 06:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
obviously the world's changed a lot
 
06:01:49.250 --> 06:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
since 1935 the federal power act has
 
06:01:50.930 --> 06:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
tried to keep up with that or Congress
 
06:01:52.788 --> 06:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
has tried to keep up with that but in
 
06:01:55.430 --> 06:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
some ways we're using a statute that is
 
06:01:57.770 --> 06:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
very old to deal with problems we have
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
today so under the federal power Act
 
06:02:02.810 --> 06:02:02.820 align:start position:0%
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
 
06:02:05.930 --> 06:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
oversees wholesale electricity
 
06:02:07.850 --> 06:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
and Interstate transmission of
 
06:02:10.010 --> 06:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
electricity at high voltage and you know
 
06:02:13.190 --> 06:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
wholesale is one of those terms of Art
 
06:02:16.850 --> 06:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
in electricity law that is really easy
 
06:02:19.310 --> 06:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
to understand it means exactly what you
 
06:02:22.910 --> 06:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
think it means sale for resale so a lot
 
06:02:24.830 --> 06:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
of This is complicated that part isn't
 
06:02:27.350 --> 06:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
complicated and wholesale electricity
 
06:02:30.770 --> 06:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
sale for resale is regulated by ferc
 
06:02:33.590 --> 06:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
under the federal power act and then so
 
06:02:35.810 --> 06:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
what do states do well states regulate
 
06:02:39.708 --> 06:02:39.718 align:start position:0%
retail electricity uh it regulates what
 
06:02:41.510 --> 06:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
generation gets billed within the
 
06:02:43.730 --> 06:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
borders of any state so we still get to
 
06:02:46.970 --> 06:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
decide that and we are still in charge
 
06:02:51.530 --> 06:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
as States on uh of so-called resource
 
06:02:53.330 --> 06:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
adequacy the question that got asked
 
06:02:55.310 --> 06:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
earlier of like well who's really in
 
06:02:57.708 --> 06:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
charge of making sure that we have the
 
06:03:00.170 --> 06:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
generation we need to keep the lights on
 
06:03:01.610 --> 06:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
and the answer you got from the
 
06:03:03.530 --> 06:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
Department of energy was ISO New England
 
06:03:05.868 --> 06:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
and that was a correct answer but this
 
06:03:09.048 --> 06:03:09.058 align:start position:0%
states have willingly ceded that
 
06:03:11.330 --> 06:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
authority to ISO New England make no
 
06:03:14.510 --> 06:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
mistake and states can if they want claw
 
06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
that Authority back and there are some
 
06:03:18.410 --> 06:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
people I don't think I'm among them but
 
06:03:20.208 --> 06:03:20.218 align:start position:0%
there are some people who think that is
 
06:03:23.208 --> 06:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
something we ought to consider doing
 
06:03:24.890 --> 06:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
so what is this thing ISO New England
 
06:03:27.010 --> 06:03:27.020 align:start position:0%
it's a garden variety
 
06:03:27.020 --> 06:03:29.170 align:start position:0%
it's a garden variety
501c

06:03:29.170 --> 06:03:29.180 align:start position:0%
501c
 
06:03:33.410 --> 06:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
501c4 501c3 non-profit organization
 
06:03:36.288 --> 06:03:36.298 align:start position:0%
Incorporated I think in Connecticut it's
 
06:03:39.110 --> 06:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
based in Massachusetts it is a so-called
 
06:03:41.150 --> 06:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
Regional transmission organization it's
 
06:03:44.510 --> 06:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
regulated by ferc its job is to operate
 
06:03:46.430 --> 06:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
the bulk power transmission system for
 
06:03:48.948 --> 06:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
the whole region it oversees the
 
06:03:51.830 --> 06:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity markets meaning it
 
06:03:53.690 --> 06:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
not only operates those markets but
 
06:03:55.310 --> 06:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
determines what the rules of those
 
06:03:57.230 --> 06:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
markets can be it's extremely
 
06:03:59.270 --> 06:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
complicated it's in charge of power
 
06:04:01.548 --> 06:04:01.558 align:start position:0%
system planning so what are we building
 
06:04:03.470 --> 06:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
in the future by way of new transmission
 
06:04:07.310 --> 06:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
and generation facilities and it has as
 
06:04:09.470 --> 06:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
an adjunct this thing that I've heard
 
06:04:11.270 --> 06:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple of times today called
 
06:04:15.590 --> 06:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
Nepal well knee pool originally I think
 
06:04:19.970 --> 06:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
it dates from 1970 or so was a it stood
 
06:04:22.070 --> 06:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
for a New England power pool and that
 
06:04:25.330 --> 06:04:25.340 align:start position:0%
goes back to the great blackout of 1965
 
06:04:27.770 --> 06:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
when the utilities decided you know
 
06:04:29.330 --> 06:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
maybe we really ought to cooperate with
 
06:04:32.270 --> 06:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
each other and run our systems jointly
 
06:04:34.970 --> 06:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
so that when the system gets stressed
 
06:04:37.548 --> 06:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
stressed we won't necessarily have
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
devastating blackouts so we'll create
 
06:04:41.270 --> 06:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
one big control room in Massachusetts
 
06:04:44.628 --> 06:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
and the entity that did that uh created
 
06:04:46.310 --> 06:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
by the utilities was called knee pool
 
06:04:49.070 --> 06:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
when ISO New England was created the job
 
06:04:51.410 --> 06:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
of running the electricity grid and the
 
06:04:53.930 --> 06:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
ownership of the control room in
 
06:04:56.150 --> 06:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts passed ISO New England and
 
06:04:59.030 --> 06:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
knee pool's life was extended as the
 
06:05:02.330 --> 06:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
so-called stakeholder advisory body to
 
06:05:05.948 --> 06:05:05.958 align:start position:0%
Nepal why did I put the
 
06:05:09.890 --> 06:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
word advisory in quotes it is because in
 
06:05:12.470 --> 06:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
my opinion knee pool is a lot more than
 
06:05:15.970 --> 06:05:15.980 align:start position:0%
it Advisory Board it for various reasons
 
06:05:20.390 --> 06:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
has uh almost veto authority over what
 
06:05:23.628 --> 06:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
policies at least Market policies ISO
 
06:05:26.150 --> 06:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
adopt so it's a very very very powerful
 
06:05:29.208 --> 06:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
organization and for that reason my
 
06:05:31.490 --> 06:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
office is actually a voting member of
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
Nepal we're part of the so-called end
 
06:05:36.910 --> 06:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
user sector of Nepal Nepal has very
 
06:05:40.310 --> 06:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
elaborate voting rules that are designed
 
06:05:42.110 --> 06:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the Legacy interests
 
06:05:44.330 --> 06:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
meaning the transmission owners and the
 
06:05:46.070 --> 06:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
generation owners are basically
 
06:05:48.650 --> 06:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
dominating the other sectors the end
 
06:05:50.570 --> 06:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
user sector really should be the boss of
 
06:05:53.270 --> 06:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
all of Nepal why because we pay the
 
06:05:54.830 --> 06:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
bills we're the only wallet in the room
 
06:05:56.750 --> 06:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless we're just one little
 
06:05:59.990 --> 06:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
sector in Nepal and we are a voting
 
06:06:02.090 --> 06:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
member of that sector so that's
 
06:06:04.250 --> 06:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
different than the role that the
 
06:06:06.708 --> 06:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
department of energy plays Commissioner
 
06:06:09.410 --> 06:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
shacoin is our state's Nesco manager so
 
06:06:13.368 --> 06:06:13.378 align:start position:0%
he represents the governor at Nesco and
 
06:06:16.250 --> 06:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
Nesco represents the states as Sovereign
 
06:06:19.490 --> 06:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
entities in dealing with ISO New England
 
06:06:21.890 --> 06:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
we're actually a voting member of Nepal
 
06:06:24.470 --> 06:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so what do I try to do I try my best
 
06:06:26.090 --> 06:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
at all times and I think we're
 
06:06:28.788 --> 06:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
succeeding all the time at coordinating
 
06:06:31.490 --> 06:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
the positions that we take at Nepal with
 
06:06:33.590 --> 06:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
the positions that commissioner shacoin
 
06:06:36.650 --> 06:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
is taking as our Nesco manager at Nesco
 
06:06:39.110 --> 06:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
so that we are all working together to
 
06:06:42.410 --> 06:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
advance the public policy of our state
 
06:06:44.990 --> 06:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
so I was so glad to hear representative
 
06:06:48.410 --> 06:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
naughter extol the virtues of the iso to
 
06:06:51.650 --> 06:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
go app you should definitely have that
 
06:06:54.048 --> 06:06:54.058 align:start position:0%
app on your phone the governor likes to
 
06:06:56.170 --> 06:06:56.180 align:start position:0%
uh boast that he does and well he should
 
06:06:58.970 --> 06:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sure representative Nutter has it on
 
06:07:01.910 --> 06:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
her phone uh and when you have it on
 
06:07:03.830 --> 06:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
your phone you can watch what is
 
06:07:06.350 --> 06:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
happening on the electricity grid minute
 
06:07:08.150 --> 06:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
to minute and what you access when you
 
06:07:12.530 --> 06:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
fire up the app is this map and these
 
06:07:16.010 --> 06:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
are screenshots I took off of the app at
 
06:07:18.530 --> 06:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
two different recent times on the New
 
06:07:20.208 --> 06:07:20.218 align:start position:0%
England electricity grid and this is
 
06:07:22.430 --> 06:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
just such an interesting little pair of
 
06:07:25.490 --> 06:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
snapshots of uh what can happen in New
 
06:07:27.890 --> 06:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
England uh last week as I was getting
 
06:07:29.570 --> 06:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
this slide debt together I just decided
 
06:07:31.070 --> 06:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
hey what's going on on the grid now and
 
06:07:33.770 --> 06:07:33.780 align:start position:0%
so I took this snapshot on the left and
 
06:07:36.048 --> 06:07:36.058 align:start position:0%
and you see what you're looking at there
 
06:07:39.350 --> 06:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
is the locational marginal price meaning
 
06:07:42.350 --> 06:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
the prevailing spot price for wholesale
 
06:07:46.310 --> 06:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
sale electricity at each place in the
 
06:07:48.048 --> 06:07:48.058 align:start position:0%
system where that price is separately
 
06:07:50.990 --> 06:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
set so New Hampshire gets its own price
 
06:07:54.350 --> 06:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
of wholesale electricity in any uh in
 
06:07:56.690 --> 06:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
any uh it varies I think by five minute
 
06:07:59.030 --> 06:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
increments and at that point it was 48
 
06:08:00.890 --> 06:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
dollars and three cents well you can
 
06:08:02.628 --> 06:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
translate dollars
 
06:08:04.788 --> 06:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
per megawatt hour which is what that
 
06:08:07.910 --> 06:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
number is two cents per kilowatt hour uh
 
06:08:10.010 --> 06:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
quite easily forty eight dollars and
 
06:08:13.070 --> 06:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
three cents comes down to 4.8 cents per
 
06:08:15.410 --> 06:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour so would the default
 
06:08:17.990 --> 06:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
Energy Service were anything close to
 
06:08:21.048 --> 06:08:21.058 align:start position:0%
4.8 cents per kilowatt hour but you can
 
06:08:23.868 --> 06:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
see that uh for uh whatever reason that
 
06:08:25.850 --> 06:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
price was really low at seven o'clock
 
06:08:28.128 --> 06:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
P.M on January 5th but then if you
 
06:08:31.548 --> 06:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
happen to fire up your ISO to go app on
 
06:08:34.670 --> 06:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
Christmas Eve like I did why did I do
 
06:08:36.410 --> 06:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
that well I was hanging out with my
 
06:08:38.570 --> 06:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
relatives and I was bored and you know
 
06:08:39.830 --> 06:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
you have to get away from your family
 
06:08:42.110 --> 06:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
somehow so you start fiddling with the
 
06:08:45.110 --> 06:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
apps on your phone I turned on my ISO
 
06:08:46.910 --> 06:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
New England ISO to go app and lo and
 
06:08:49.490 --> 06:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
behold I see this red map red is bad
 
06:08:52.548 --> 06:08:52.558 align:start position:0%
even on Christmas and you know here in
 
06:08:54.048 --> 06:08:54.058 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the spot price of
 
06:08:58.090 --> 06:08:58.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:01.610 --> 06:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
2294.26 per megawatt hour again let's
 
06:09:03.770 --> 06:09:03.780 align:start position:0%
translate that in into cents per
 
06:09:06.530 --> 06:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour you can't it it's too big
 
06:09:09.708 --> 06:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
it's actually two dollars and ninety
 
06:09:12.350 --> 06:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
four cents per kilowatt hour well if you
 
06:09:15.350 --> 06:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
think paying 26 cents per kilowatt hour
 
06:09:18.048 --> 06:09:18.058 align:start position:0%
is an outrageously high price imagine if
 
06:09:20.750 --> 06:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
somebody sent you a bill uh for your
 
06:09:24.410 --> 06:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
electricity at two dollars and uh 29
 
06:09:26.930 --> 06:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour that fortunately
 
06:09:29.628 --> 06:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
is not a price that anybody ever
 
06:09:33.230 --> 06:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
actually pays at retail uh these
 
06:09:35.690 --> 06:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
wholesale prices are designed to
 
06:09:38.270 --> 06:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
essentially send again price signals
 
06:09:40.730 --> 06:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
about the current state of the market so
 
06:09:43.250 --> 06:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
the way our electricity Market is
 
06:09:46.190 --> 06:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
designed the price of wholesale
 
06:09:48.048 --> 06:09:48.058 align:start position:0%
electricity everywhere in New England is
 
06:09:51.830 --> 06:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
actually capped at two thousand dollars
 
06:09:55.250 --> 06:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
so your question might be well how is it
 
06:09:56.930 --> 06:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
that the price is over two thousand
 
06:09:59.810 --> 06:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
dollars then and the answer is that in
 
06:10:02.208 --> 06:10:02.218 align:start position:0%
this scenario at that hour just about
 
06:10:04.788 --> 06:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
dinner time on Christmas Eve there were
 
06:10:07.548 --> 06:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
units that had agreed to generate and
 
06:10:10.788 --> 06:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
had a capacity Supply obligation that
 
06:10:13.190 --> 06:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
were not available and they were
 
06:10:16.910 --> 06:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
penalized financially and the result of
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
that Financial penalty are those numbers
 
06:10:22.750 --> 06:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
in excess of two thousand dollars so
 
06:10:26.990 --> 06:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
this is not a monetary crisis that you
 
06:10:30.230 --> 06:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
see on the right side this is a warning
 
06:10:33.650 --> 06:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
that the electricity grid is too easily
 
06:10:37.430 --> 06:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
pushed into a situation that in in which
 
06:10:39.350 --> 06:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
it is stressed what was stressing the
 
06:10:42.350 --> 06:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
electricity Grid at 525 on Christmas Eve
 
06:10:44.330 --> 06:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
well a couple of things you may remember
 
06:10:46.730 --> 06:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
that the weather was kind of wonky that
 
06:10:49.368 --> 06:10:49.378 align:start position:0%
day right it was cold and in fact it was
 
06:10:52.490 --> 06:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
colder than the weather forecast had
 
06:10:55.910 --> 06:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
expected so instead and the temperature
 
06:10:58.128 --> 06:10:58.138 align:start position:0%
maybe you remember plummeted drastically
 
06:11:01.010 --> 06:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
in a very quick period of time well that
 
06:11:03.650 --> 06:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
was not expected at exactly the time it
 
06:11:05.448 --> 06:11:05.458 align:start position:0%
occurred and so therefore the weather
 
06:11:07.850 --> 06:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
was colder than expected demand was
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
higher than expected for much of that
 
06:11:11.570 --> 06:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
day that is a big part of what was
 
06:11:13.368 --> 06:11:13.378 align:start position:0%
stressing the grid and then there were
 
06:11:15.048 --> 06:11:15.058 align:start position:0%
some generators that weren't available
 
06:11:17.330 --> 06:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
that promised to be available and the
 
06:11:20.048 --> 06:11:20.058 align:start position:0%
next thing you know you have this crisis
 
06:11:22.548 --> 06:11:22.558 align:start position:0%
and again I think the moral of the story
 
06:11:24.590 --> 06:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
is that that happens a little too easily
 
06:11:30.530 --> 06:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:31.730 --> 06:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
I think you're going to have some
 
06:11:33.410 --> 06:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
questions about that one uh
 
06:11:36.470 --> 06:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative nodder thank you it's
 
06:11:39.230 --> 06:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
just it's 37 34 at the moment
 
06:11:41.690 --> 06:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's a that's great those are
 
06:11:43.368 --> 06:11:43.378 align:start position:0%
the kinds of prices that we used to see
 
06:11:46.250 --> 06:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
all the time you know two years ago and
 
06:11:49.070 --> 06:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know now it's all together two two
 
06:11:52.548 --> 06:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
common to see prices you know not in the
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
Red Zone but in the kind of yellow
 
06:11:56.948 --> 06:11:56.958 align:start position:0%
orange zone of like 300 a megawatt hour
 
06:11:59.448 --> 06:11:59.458 align:start position:0%
uh you know those were the forward
 
06:12:03.110 --> 06:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
prices that we were looking at for this
 
06:12:05.090 --> 06:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
month when we were hashing out the
 
06:12:06.890 --> 06:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
question of what the price of default
 
06:12:08.690 --> 06:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
Energy service was going to be this this
 
06:12:11.868 --> 06:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
winter so it's really it's it's good to
 
06:12:13.730 --> 06:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
just keep track of where that where
 
06:12:15.770 --> 06:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
that's going on an hour to hour basis
 
06:12:17.628 --> 06:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
and then it's great to kind of take a
 
06:12:19.430 --> 06:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
step back every so often and say well
 
06:12:21.590 --> 06:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
what happened yesterday you know and
 
06:12:23.510 --> 06:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
where did load go compared to where it
 
06:12:26.628 --> 06:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
was supposed to go and what what went
 
06:12:29.150 --> 06:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
wrong and what caused what price blips
 
06:12:33.708 --> 06:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
and it usually is uh some combination of
 
06:12:35.390 --> 06:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
unpredicted it's usually it's
 
06:12:38.570 --> 06:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
unpredicted events so unpredicted events
 
06:12:41.270 --> 06:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
on the supply side unpredicted events on
 
06:12:43.070 --> 06:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
the demand side the other thing I want
 
06:12:44.810 --> 06:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
to say about that Infamous little crisis
 
06:12:47.868 --> 06:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
on Christmas Eve is that a Mystic
 
06:12:47.878 --> 06:12:49.070 align:start position:0%
on Christmas Eve is that a Mystic
station

06:12:49.070 --> 06:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
station
 
06:12:51.310 --> 06:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
which is the Region's largest generator
 
06:12:54.230 --> 06:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
1400 megawatts and I have a whole slide
 
06:12:55.788 --> 06:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
about them in a minute they were not
 
06:13:00.048 --> 06:13:00.058 align:start position:0%
generating on Christmas Eve and I wrote
 
06:13:02.810 --> 06:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
a column about this little event called
 
06:13:04.730 --> 06:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
The Nightmare the electricity Nightmare
 
06:13:08.030 --> 06:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
Before Christmas my column by the way
 
06:13:10.690 --> 06:13:10.700 align:start position:0%
appears on the news website
 
06:13:13.070 --> 06:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
indepthnh.org I was a journalist before
 
06:13:16.430 --> 06:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
I was a lawyer and in some ways my legal
 
06:13:18.110 --> 06:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
career is really just an outgrowth of my
 
06:13:20.810 --> 06:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
journalism career so I tried I write
 
06:13:22.610 --> 06:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
columns about my work as a way of
 
06:13:24.470 --> 06:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
explaining all of this to people so I
 
06:13:26.930 --> 06:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
wrote a whole column about that December
 
06:13:29.628 --> 06:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
24th Nightmare and one of the things I
 
06:13:31.548 --> 06:13:31.558 align:start position:0%
discovered is that Mystic station was
 
06:13:33.590 --> 06:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
not generating now I made a point of
 
06:13:35.750 --> 06:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
saying in that column that I didn't know
 
06:13:39.170 --> 06:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
why that was and very quickly the owners
 
06:13:41.448 --> 06:13:41.458 align:start position:0%
of Mystic station uh constellation new
 
06:13:44.208 --> 06:13:44.218 align:start position:0%
energy send an email to my editor that
 
06:13:46.548 --> 06:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
said we weren't generating because we
 
06:13:48.948 --> 06:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
weren't dispatched we were ready to go
 
06:13:51.650 --> 06:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
and we had fuel but we were not
 
06:13:54.170 --> 06:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
dispatched I would like to know maybe
 
06:13:56.628 --> 06:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
you would like to know why that was I do
 
06:13:59.750 --> 06:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
not know and ISO New England won't tell
 
06:14:02.628 --> 06:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
you I predict because they're very cagey
 
06:14:05.390 --> 06:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
about what they reveal about who bid
 
06:14:07.310 --> 06:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
what and who got dispatched and who
 
06:14:10.670 --> 06:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't dispatched and why it it is a
 
06:14:13.250 --> 06:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
problem so we will be sure to ask them
 
06:14:15.590 --> 06:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
when they're here indeed indeed and I
 
06:14:16.788 --> 06:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
hope I'll be sitting in the audience
 
06:14:19.030 --> 06:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
when you ask that question on the 19th
 
06:14:21.350 --> 06:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question for
 
06:14:23.810 --> 06:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman what is the
 
06:14:25.970 --> 06:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which these prices are set
 
06:14:27.948 --> 06:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
there's some auction going on or
 
06:14:29.628 --> 06:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
something like that and it's automated
 
06:14:31.970 --> 06:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
or what is the actual mechanism to set
 
06:14:34.850 --> 06:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
these prices that's a great question so
 
06:14:38.930 --> 06:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh there is a set of elaborate Market
 
06:14:42.590 --> 06:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
rules most power most electricity is
 
06:14:45.170 --> 06:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
committed by contract well in advance so
 
06:14:46.548 --> 06:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at on those screen
 
06:14:48.890 --> 06:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
with those two price Maps that's the
 
06:14:52.670 --> 06:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
spot price so that is where electricity
 
06:14:55.610 --> 06:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
that is not committed is bought and sold
 
06:14:58.868 --> 06:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
in real time most electricity
 
06:15:01.788 --> 06:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
is resolved in the so-called day ahead
 
06:15:04.850 --> 06:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
market so anything that's left over that
 
06:15:06.350 --> 06:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be committed in order to meet
 
06:15:09.948 --> 06:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
the predicted demand for tomorrow is uh
 
06:15:12.048 --> 06:15:12.058 align:start position:0%
locked in at about 2 pm every day
 
06:15:14.628 --> 06:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
through the so-called day ahead market
 
06:15:16.610 --> 06:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
and then when tomorrow turns out to be
 
06:15:18.590 --> 06:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
not exactly as we predicted to be today
 
06:15:21.110 --> 06:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we use the spot prices for
 
06:15:23.810 --> 06:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
so every generator that is available
 
06:15:27.288 --> 06:15:27.298 align:start position:0%
makes a bid that is based on its cost of
 
06:15:29.510 --> 06:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
generation and there's a market monitor
 
06:15:31.670 --> 06:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
that makes sure that those bids are cost
 
06:15:34.788 --> 06:15:34.798 align:start position:0%
baits based so there's no Enron esque
 
06:15:37.610 --> 06:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
funny business and those bids are
 
06:15:40.448 --> 06:15:40.458 align:start position:0%
entered and the control room in Holyoke
 
06:15:43.128 --> 06:15:43.138 align:start position:0%
dispatches the available generation in
 
06:15:45.770 --> 06:15:45.780 align:start position:0%
Merit order meaning it plugs in the
 
06:15:47.390 --> 06:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
cheap stuff first and it keeps working
 
06:15:51.288 --> 06:15:51.298 align:start position:0%
up and up and up and the last unit that
 
06:15:53.810 --> 06:15:53.820 align:start position:0%
it dispatches is the most expensive unit
 
06:15:56.030 --> 06:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
the one that makes the highest bid and
 
06:15:57.890 --> 06:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
that bid that they're the marginal
 
06:16:01.548 --> 06:16:01.558 align:start position:0%
provider they set the clearing price
 
06:16:03.650 --> 06:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
that's how it works follow up follow up
 
06:16:07.310 --> 06:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm still unclear who is making the
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
bids is this human beings or is it
 
06:16:09.600 --> 06:16:10.670 align:start position:0%
bids is this human beings or is it
software

06:16:10.670 --> 06:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
software
 
06:16:13.368 --> 06:16:13.378 align:start position:0%
it's human beings I think they're using
 
06:16:15.530 --> 06:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
software but it is human beings that are
 
06:16:18.708 --> 06:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
deciding what they are willing to bid on
 
06:16:20.270 --> 06:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
behalf of the generation that they
 
06:16:23.150 --> 06:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
control and own and again there are
 
06:16:25.128 --> 06:16:25.138 align:start position:0%
there's Market monitoring so that when
 
06:16:27.350 --> 06:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
that human being makes a bid
 
06:16:29.750 --> 06:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
that person has to be able to verify
 
06:16:31.730 --> 06:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
that the bid was based on the company's
 
06:16:35.390 --> 06:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
actual cost of producing not some made
 
06:16:37.430 --> 06:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
up number the the risk being that you'll
 
06:16:39.230 --> 06:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
enter some bid that's way lower than
 
06:16:41.350 --> 06:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
your cost or do some other funny
 
06:16:43.490 --> 06:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
gamesmanship that will distort the
 
06:16:45.830 --> 06:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
market we we don't like that because we
 
06:16:47.810 --> 06:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
saw in California back in 2000 what
 
06:16:50.930 --> 06:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
happens when you let that happen bad
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
so don to follow up on that question
 
06:16:56.570 --> 06:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
the real-time price right now is 38
 
06:16:58.670 --> 06:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
dollars and the day ahead price for
 
06:17:01.610 --> 06:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is 39 dollars
 
06:17:04.190 --> 06:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
how is the day ahead price calculated do
 
06:17:05.990 --> 06:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's calculated the same way
 
06:17:08.448 --> 06:17:08.458 align:start position:0%
everybody's making bids the bids are
 
06:17:14.510 --> 06:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
made a day in advance and the uh the iso
 
06:17:17.090 --> 06:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
sets the day ahead price for each hour
 
06:17:19.730 --> 06:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
one day ahead and So based on the bids
 
06:17:22.548 --> 06:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
that were put in versus the projected
 
06:17:24.770 --> 06:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
demand for this hour tomorrow that was
 
06:17:26.448 --> 06:17:26.458 align:start position:0%
the clearing price
 
06:17:29.208 --> 06:17:29.218 align:start position:0%
and note by the way that there's a
 
06:17:31.070 --> 06:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
separate locational price for each
 
06:17:33.948 --> 06:17:33.958 align:start position:0%
region it's mostly goes by state but
 
06:17:36.288 --> 06:17:36.298 align:start position:0%
they carved Massachusetts up into three
 
06:17:40.548 --> 06:17:40.558 align:start position:0%
regions so uh those different prices are
 
06:17:42.048 --> 06:17:42.058 align:start position:0%
supposed to take into account the
 
06:17:44.810 --> 06:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
existence of transmission constraints so
 
06:17:47.208 --> 06:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
that you know when power can move freely
 
06:17:49.490 --> 06:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
through the region the locational
 
06:17:51.890 --> 06:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
marginal price is the same or nearly the
 
06:17:54.350 --> 06:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
same everywhere and that is mostly where
 
06:17:56.208 --> 06:17:56.218 align:start position:0%
we are today we've spent billions of
 
06:17:58.128 --> 06:17:58.138 align:start position:0%
dollars we pay the highest transmission
 
06:18:01.548 --> 06:18:01.558 align:start position:0%
rates in the whole country and you don't
 
06:18:02.990 --> 06:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to like that I
 
06:18:04.670 --> 06:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
certainly don't but what we got by
 
06:18:07.010 --> 06:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
paying those High rates is a
 
06:18:08.930 --> 06:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
transmission grid that is essentially
 
06:18:11.628 --> 06:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
congestion free congestion used to be a
 
06:18:13.670 --> 06:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
much bigger problem in New England than
 
06:18:16.430 --> 06:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
it is now and so now you see that e in
 
06:18:18.830 --> 06:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
either the unstressed or stressed
 
06:18:20.510 --> 06:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
condition the prices around the region
 
06:18:23.390 --> 06:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
were pretty comparable
 
06:18:23.400 --> 06:18:24.708 align:start position:0%
were pretty comparable
um

06:18:24.708 --> 06:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:26.690 --> 06:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
okay so I stole this slide from my
 
06:18:28.730 --> 06:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
friends at eversource and the point
 
06:18:30.490 --> 06:18:30.500 align:start position:0%
eversource is making one more
 
06:18:33.590 --> 06:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative please thank you chairman
 
06:18:36.230 --> 06:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:18:38.448 --> 06:18:38.458 align:start position:0%
um can you give it an idea of what
 
06:18:41.330 --> 06:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
percentage of the total uh electricity
 
06:18:44.270 --> 06:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
being used is on the market
 
06:18:46.850 --> 06:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
so you said that some of it is purchased
 
06:18:48.288 --> 06:18:48.298 align:start position:0%
through the six-month contracts right
 
06:18:50.208 --> 06:18:50.218 align:start position:0%
that would be most of it I assume and
 
06:18:52.190 --> 06:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
then there's some small amount that is
 
06:18:54.110 --> 06:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
so this Market is actually covering just
 
06:18:55.548 --> 06:18:55.558 align:start position:0%
that small portion
 
06:18:57.410 --> 06:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
can you say how much that is thank you
 
06:19:00.170 --> 06:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh well those are great questions to ask
 
06:19:02.448 --> 06:19:02.458 align:start position:0%
the folks from the iso and the answer
 
06:19:05.150 --> 06:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
depends in part on how into the weeds
 
06:19:06.650 --> 06:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
you want to get about how the markets
 
06:19:09.590 --> 06:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
really work technically it's all on the
 
06:19:11.930 --> 06:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
market I mean everything has to be bid
 
06:19:14.270 --> 06:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
in and everything gets the market
 
06:19:16.190 --> 06:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
clearing price but if you've already
 
06:19:18.890 --> 06:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
locked in a contract for some of that
 
06:19:20.930 --> 06:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
power it essentially operates in Market
 
06:19:22.548 --> 06:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
terms as a hedge against the market
 
06:19:26.390 --> 06:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
price uh and so in effect you get the
 
06:19:29.208 --> 06:19:29.218 align:start position:0%
benefit of whatever long-term contract
 
06:19:30.890 --> 06:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
you have entered into I don't know if
 
06:19:32.090 --> 06:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
that makes sense but that's the way it
 
06:19:35.628 --> 06:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:35.638 --> 06:19:37.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:19:37.570 --> 06:19:37.580 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:19:40.970 --> 06:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
representative Corbin thank you
 
06:19:43.788 --> 06:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
the clearing prices as I understand what
 
06:19:47.150 --> 06:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
you said there are different generators
 
06:19:49.390 --> 06:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
and they are charging different prices
 
06:19:53.868 --> 06:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
and those prices are going up as as the
 
06:19:55.910 --> 06:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
bidding is going up
 
06:19:57.770 --> 06:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
and then eventually we hit the clearing
 
06:19:59.990 --> 06:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
price and everybody's getting the
 
06:20:01.610 --> 06:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
clearing price that's right you said
 
06:20:02.810 --> 06:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
they're charging different prices
 
06:20:04.610 --> 06:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
they're not charging different prices
 
06:20:07.368 --> 06:20:07.378 align:start position:0%
they're bidding different prices but
 
06:20:10.128 --> 06:20:10.138 align:start position:0%
everybody gets the clear in price you're
 
06:20:11.628 --> 06:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
just talking about that at lunch you
 
06:20:13.788 --> 06:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
know trying to imagine what other
 
06:20:17.628 --> 06:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
markets are designed that way and uh I I
 
06:20:18.948 --> 06:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
think that's the way capitalism
 
06:20:22.690 --> 06:20:22.700 align:start position:0%
generally works right like if you uh are
 
06:20:26.448 --> 06:20:26.458 align:start position:0%
if you make Cheerios or if you make
 
06:20:28.670 --> 06:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
cereal that people like to eat and you
 
06:20:31.010 --> 06:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
figure out some secret way to make it at
 
06:20:32.930 --> 06:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
half the cost of your competitor you
 
06:20:34.430 --> 06:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
don't automatically pass that cost
 
06:20:36.530 --> 06:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
savings onto your customer you keep the
 
06:20:38.868 --> 06:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
benefit of your Innovation as best you
 
06:20:40.610 --> 06:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
can as the producer because you're a
 
06:20:42.770 --> 06:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
profit maximizing firm and that's what
 
06:20:44.270 --> 06:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
these companies are and so the idea is
 
06:20:46.548 --> 06:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
that we want to encourage generators to
 
06:20:48.470 --> 06:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
be efficient and one way we do that is
 
06:20:51.770 --> 06:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
by letting them keep that uh that extra
 
06:20:54.590 --> 06:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue that they incur by basically
 
06:20:57.590 --> 06:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
being able to produce at less than the
 
06:21:02.930 --> 06:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:04.850 --> 06:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
06:21:07.490 --> 06:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh so I stole this slide from eversource
 
06:21:09.410 --> 06:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
and what it's really saying is that we
 
06:21:11.690 --> 06:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
are because we went through a decade of
 
06:21:14.448 --> 06:21:14.458 align:start position:0%
very low prices for natural gas we
 
06:21:16.368 --> 06:21:16.378 align:start position:0%
became very Reliant in New England on
 
06:21:18.190 --> 06:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
natural gas to produce our electricity
 
06:21:21.350 --> 06:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
and those chickens have now come home to
 
06:21:24.230 --> 06:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
roost uh one way of posing the question
 
06:21:26.330 --> 06:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
of why our electricity rates so high
 
06:21:29.570 --> 06:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
right now is to ask conversely why were
 
06:21:31.850 --> 06:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
they so low for so long and the answer
 
06:21:34.730 --> 06:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
is natural gas was cheap we're very
 
06:21:36.470 --> 06:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
reliant on natural gas and when the
 
06:21:38.570 --> 06:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
price of natural gas goes up our
 
06:21:41.208 --> 06:21:41.218 align:start position:0%
electricity prices go up why because we
 
06:21:43.548 --> 06:21:43.558 align:start position:0%
are participating in the global market
 
06:21:47.510 --> 06:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
for natural gas so there was a huge
 
06:21:49.610 --> 06:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
uptick in global demand for natural gas
 
06:21:52.310 --> 06:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
the United States is an exporter of
 
06:21:53.930 --> 06:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
natural gas to much of the rest of the
 
06:21:55.970 --> 06:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
world we convert natural gas into
 
06:21:58.490 --> 06:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
liquefied natural gas we put it on big
 
06:22:00.048 --> 06:22:00.058 align:start position:0%
tankers and we ship it all over the
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
world and so we here in New Hampshire or
 
06:22:04.368 --> 06:22:04.378 align:start position:0%
in New England are competing with
 
06:22:07.850 --> 06:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
natural gas s users everywhere on the
 
06:22:10.010 --> 06:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
planet and the results are the high
 
06:22:11.930 --> 06:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
electricity the high natural gas prices
 
06:22:15.708 --> 06:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
that we see driving High electricity
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
prices and you know 45 percent of our
 
06:22:21.830 --> 06:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
portfolio being in natural gas
 
06:22:23.930 --> 06:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
that's a lot
 
06:22:25.910 --> 06:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
um and you know this graph makes the
 
06:22:28.610 --> 06:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
point a different way the price of
 
06:22:32.390 --> 06:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas on the uh on the on the
 
06:22:34.850 --> 06:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
competitive market for natural gas in
 
06:22:37.970 --> 06:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
either at the Henry Hub down in Texas or
 
06:22:40.850 --> 06:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
at Dracut much closer to New Hampshire
 
06:22:43.250 --> 06:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
no matter where you measure it the price
 
06:22:45.770 --> 06:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
of electricity and the price of natural
 
06:22:45.780 --> 06:22:46.868 align:start position:0%
of electricity and the price of natural
gas

06:22:46.868 --> 06:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
gas
 
06:22:51.350 --> 06:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
are totally totally correlated and I I
 
06:22:53.930 --> 06:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
guess I'd like to make a uh I'd like to
 
06:22:57.110 --> 06:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
express a hypothesis about the war in
 
06:22:57.120 --> 06:22:58.310 align:start position:0%
express a hypothesis about the war in
Ukraine

06:22:58.310 --> 06:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
Ukraine
 
06:23:00.830 --> 06:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
some people blame the war in Ukraine for
 
06:23:03.830 --> 06:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
the run-up in electricity prices and I I
 
06:23:06.288 --> 06:23:06.298 align:start position:0%
think that the thing to blame on the war
 
06:23:09.288 --> 06:23:09.298 align:start position:0%
in Ukraine is the volatility in prices
 
06:23:12.350 --> 06:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing now I think that if
 
06:23:15.470 --> 06:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
you look at where we were headed even
 
06:23:18.590 --> 06:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
before our friend Vladimir Putin invaded
 
06:23:20.628 --> 06:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
Ukraine you'll see that we were already
 
06:23:24.770 --> 06:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
in a pretty significant upward Glide in
 
06:23:26.628 --> 06:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
natural gas prices so I think the prices
 
06:23:29.090 --> 06:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
might be a lot like they are today even
 
06:23:31.010 --> 06:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
had there not been an invasion of
 
06:23:34.070 --> 06:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
Ukraine but Ukraine is creating where
 
06:23:37.788 --> 06:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
weird up and downs ups and downs in the
 
06:23:40.250 --> 06:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh Global price of natural gas and
 
06:23:41.810 --> 06:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
therefore the price of electricity that
 
06:23:43.970 --> 06:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
we pay here in New England now I
 
06:23:46.128 --> 06:23:46.138 align:start position:0%
mentioned Mystic station so when next
 
06:23:47.628 --> 06:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
time you drive down to Boston and you're
 
06:23:50.750 --> 06:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
going down I-93 and you're almost to
 
06:23:52.850 --> 06:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
Boston you can see the Boston skyline
 
06:23:54.770 --> 06:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
right in front of you look off to your
 
06:23:57.110 --> 06:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
left look for the wind turbine which is
 
06:23:59.150 --> 06:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
not part of Mystic station but right
 
06:24:02.390 --> 06:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
behind it is Mystic station it's owned
 
06:24:04.670 --> 06:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
by constellation new energy it is the
 
06:24:06.548 --> 06:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
Region's biggest
 
06:24:09.170 --> 06:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
generator unlike it's a natural gas
 
06:24:11.330 --> 06:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
generator the three stacks on the right
 
06:24:14.150 --> 06:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
side are retired coal units they're not
 
06:24:16.368 --> 06:24:16.378 align:start position:0%
working the two stacks on the left are
 
06:24:19.430 --> 06:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
the two uh gas generators at Mystic
 
06:24:21.708 --> 06:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
station that produce a total of 1400
 
06:24:23.868 --> 06:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
megawatts Mystic station is unique
 
06:24:26.330 --> 06:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
because it's a natural gas generator but
 
06:24:28.490 --> 06:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
it doesn't connect to the regional
 
06:24:31.548 --> 06:24:31.558 align:start position:0%
Interstate natural gas pipeline it uses
 
06:24:33.830 --> 06:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
liquefied natural gas that arrives by
 
06:24:36.590 --> 06:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
boat and yes for reasons of the Jones
 
06:24:39.170 --> 06:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
act and otherwise right now it's getting
 
06:24:42.670 --> 06:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
its energy from Trinidad and Tobago
 
06:24:45.770 --> 06:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
the owners of Mystic station announced a
 
06:24:46.850 --> 06:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
few years ago that they were going to
 
06:24:48.470 --> 06:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
retire the unit because they thought
 
06:24:50.330 --> 06:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't make money operating
 
06:24:53.390 --> 06:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
it anymore and in response to that
 
06:24:56.510 --> 06:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh i7 New England proposed and ferc
 
06:24:59.150 --> 06:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
approved a so-called reliability must
 
06:25:01.548 --> 06:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
run agreement with Mystic station that
 
06:25:04.850 --> 06:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
basically guarantees them their costs uh
 
06:25:07.850 --> 06:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
both this winter and next winter uh
 
06:25:10.548 --> 06:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
whatever those costs are and their fuel
 
06:25:14.150 --> 06:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
costs are extremely volatile and we're
 
06:25:16.810 --> 06:25:16.820 align:start position:0%
all paying them and it is a deviation
 
06:25:19.850 --> 06:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
from the market-based principles that
 
06:25:21.890 --> 06:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
ordinarily govern wholesale and Retail
 
06:25:25.250 --> 06:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
electricity it's a reprise of the battle
 
06:25:28.670 --> 06:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
days when you if you operated it you
 
06:25:30.948 --> 06:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
were guaranteed to recover your costs so
 
06:25:32.448 --> 06:25:32.458 align:start position:0%
that's what Mystic station is doing it's
 
06:25:35.030 --> 06:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
getting these so-called RMR payments and
 
06:25:37.910 --> 06:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
that of course begs and flat out raises
 
06:25:39.730 --> 06:25:39.740 align:start position:0%
the question of why weren't they
 
06:25:44.868 --> 06:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
dispatched when we had that blip on on
 
06:25:46.788 --> 06:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
Christmas Eve while I was trying to get
 
06:25:49.310 --> 06:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
away from my relatives this is a quote
 
06:25:51.350 --> 06:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
that you can read at your leisure from I
 
06:25:53.330 --> 06:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
think it's from the ferc order approving
 
06:25:57.170 --> 06:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
that RMR agreement and there is where uh
 
06:25:59.810 --> 06:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
ferc explained exactly what it is
 
06:25:59.820 --> 06:26:01.430 align:start position:0%
ferc explained exactly what it is
okay

06:26:01.430 --> 06:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:26:04.010 --> 06:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
um it is well known to those of you who
 
06:26:05.690 --> 06:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
have ever heard me talk about these
 
06:26:08.990 --> 06:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
subjects before that uh my favorite
 
06:26:12.948 --> 06:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
subject is Energy Efficiency in fact in
 
06:26:15.350 --> 06:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
my view as consumer Advocate the best
 
06:26:18.708 --> 06:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
thing that I can deliver on behalf of
 
06:26:21.230 --> 06:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
the constituency whose interests I
 
06:26:23.868 --> 06:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
represent is Energy Efficiency why is
 
06:26:26.090 --> 06:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
that well it is because I respectfully
 
06:26:29.570 --> 06:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
contend that so-called negawatts with an
 
06:26:32.270 --> 06:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
N are cheaper than megawatts and they're
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
fungible if you can serve the next unit
 
06:26:37.850 --> 06:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
of demand for electricity by basically
 
06:26:40.310 --> 06:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
replacing that demand or backing off of
 
06:26:43.670 --> 06:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
that demand then that has the same
 
06:26:45.530 --> 06:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
effect of adding another megawatt of
 
06:26:48.948 --> 06:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
supply to the supply demand mix so if we
 
06:26:50.930 --> 06:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
can figure out ways to do the same
 
06:26:52.788 --> 06:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
amount of work produce the same amount
 
06:26:54.708 --> 06:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
of heat the same amount of light the
 
06:26:56.690 --> 06:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
same amount of motive energy for your
 
06:26:59.208 --> 06:26:59.218 align:start position:0%
industrial process but we can do it for
 
06:27:02.390 --> 06:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
Less using less energy that's Energy
 
06:27:05.690 --> 06:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and we want as much of that
 
06:27:08.990 --> 06:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
as we can possibly manage to squeeze out
 
06:27:12.470 --> 06:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the available technology so here in
 
06:27:15.170 --> 06:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have rate payer funded
 
06:27:18.410 --> 06:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs we all of us
 
06:27:20.390 --> 06:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
through our electricity and natural gas
 
06:27:23.570 --> 06:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
bills pay non-by-passable charges that
 
06:27:27.110 --> 06:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
fund State Energy Efficiency programs
 
06:27:29.448 --> 06:27:29.458 align:start position:0%
and they put a little bit of a thumb on
 
06:27:32.030 --> 06:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
the scale I would say on the side of
 
06:27:34.670 --> 06:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and as I readily and
 
06:27:36.470 --> 06:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
cheerfully concede in my second bullet
 
06:27:38.690 --> 06:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
point that is a pretty big interference
 
06:27:41.628 --> 06:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
in what would otherwise be what you
 
06:27:43.970 --> 06:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
might call free market economics but
 
06:27:46.190 --> 06:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
if you first of all if you think that
 
06:27:48.410 --> 06:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
there is otherwise in a free market in
 
06:27:51.350 --> 06:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
electricity and we can debate that
 
06:27:53.810 --> 06:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
my contention is that the perfect
 
06:27:55.128 --> 06:27:55.138 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the enemy of the good
 
06:27:56.810 --> 06:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
because these are things that would not
 
06:27:58.670 --> 06:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
happen on their own
 
06:28:01.548 --> 06:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
and so we encourage them by making them
 
06:28:01.558 --> 06:28:02.448 align:start position:0%
and so we encourage them by making them
more

06:28:02.448 --> 06:28:02.458 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:28:06.830 --> 06:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
desirable for businesses and residential
 
06:28:10.070 --> 06:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
customers to implement those measures
 
06:28:12.830 --> 06:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
in their homes and businesses so why is
 
06:28:15.170 --> 06:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
this a good idea because we have worked
 
06:28:17.690 --> 06:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
really hard in New Hampshire to develop
 
06:28:20.208 --> 06:28:20.218 align:start position:0%
a cost benefit test
 
06:28:22.070 --> 06:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
that is keyed to our state's public
 
06:28:24.830 --> 06:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
policy and has been approved by the
 
06:28:26.990 --> 06:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and has
 
06:28:29.628 --> 06:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
proven time and again that when we
 
06:28:32.810 --> 06:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
invest money in Energy Efficiency the
 
06:28:35.750 --> 06:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
benefits exceed the costs so
 
06:28:37.250 --> 06:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm so confident about
 
06:28:37.260 --> 06:28:39.110 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm so confident about
spending

06:28:39.110 --> 06:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
spending
 
06:28:40.670 --> 06:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of rate payer money on Energy
 
06:28:44.510 --> 06:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
Efficiency now I am obsessed these days
 
06:28:47.030 --> 06:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
with discount rates why am I obsessed
 
06:28:49.368 --> 06:28:49.378 align:start position:0%
with discount rates because Energy
 
06:28:52.850 --> 06:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
Efficiency measures last usually for a
 
06:28:55.010 --> 06:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
really long time if I come along and
 
06:28:57.048 --> 06:28:57.058 align:start position:0%
weatherize your home and make it super
 
06:28:59.208 --> 06:28:59.218 align:start position:0%
energy efficient those weatherization
 
06:29:01.250 --> 06:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
measures are probably going to last 30
 
06:29:04.190 --> 06:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
years well that's 30 years of Energy
 
06:29:07.490 --> 06:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
Efficiency for your house but
 
06:29:10.670 --> 06:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
what do I do with those Energy
 
06:29:13.670 --> 06:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
Efficiency benefits in year 30. what are
 
06:29:15.110 --> 06:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
they worth today well they're not going
 
06:29:17.930 --> 06:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
to be worth today exactly what they're
 
06:29:19.368 --> 06:29:19.378 align:start position:0%
worth in the future because why they're
 
06:29:21.110 --> 06:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
in the future so you have to figure out
 
06:29:24.530 --> 06:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
how to move the benefit or the value of
 
06:29:26.810 --> 06:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
that 30 years of Energy Efficiency you
 
06:29:28.730 --> 06:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
have to be able to develop develop a net
 
06:29:31.070 --> 06:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
present value for those benefits and the
 
06:29:32.510 --> 06:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
way you do that is you apply a discount
 
06:29:34.730 --> 06:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
rate well what discount rate do you
 
06:29:34.740 --> 06:29:35.810 align:start position:0%
rate well what discount rate do you
apply

06:29:35.810 --> 06:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
apply
 
06:29:38.390 --> 06:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
and you know you can argue about that a
 
06:29:40.788 --> 06:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
lot one suggestion I hear from time to
 
06:29:43.850 --> 06:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
time is let's apply the discount rate
 
06:29:47.390 --> 06:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's equal to the utilities allowed
 
06:29:50.090 --> 06:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
return on equity and you heard earlier
 
06:29:51.708 --> 06:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
speakers say that in New Hampshire I
 
06:29:53.030 --> 06:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
think Tom Frantz said that's usually
 
06:29:55.548 --> 06:29:55.558 align:start position:0%
around nine percent these days well if
 
06:29:57.948 --> 06:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
you applied a nine percent discount rate
 
06:30:00.770 --> 06:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
to Energy Efficiency benefits funded by
 
06:30:02.690 --> 06:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
our Statewide Energy Efficiency programs
 
06:30:04.670 --> 06:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
almost none of them would be cost
 
06:30:07.070 --> 06:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
effective and we wouldn't have a
 
06:30:08.750 --> 06:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide Energy Efficiency program
 
06:30:11.510 --> 06:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
anymore because they wouldn't be cost
 
06:30:13.128 --> 06:30:13.138 align:start position:0%
effective and we don't want to spend
 
06:30:16.310 --> 06:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
money that isn't cost effective but if
 
06:30:18.530 --> 06:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
you think nine percent as I do is too
 
06:30:20.090 --> 06:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
high a discount rate what's the right
 
06:30:22.610 --> 06:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
one and the answer is we don't really
 
06:30:25.010 --> 06:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
know so it's a bit of a judgment call
 
06:30:28.070 --> 06:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
and so that makes it a policy call and a
 
06:30:30.288 --> 06:30:30.298 align:start position:0%
big part of me thinks that what you
 
06:30:32.448 --> 06:30:32.458 align:start position:0%
ought to consider as a committee
 
06:30:34.190 --> 06:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
is maybe setting that discount rate
 
06:30:36.590 --> 06:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
yourself letting people come in here and
 
06:30:37.910 --> 06:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
tell you what they think it should be
 
06:30:39.770 --> 06:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
and then you is the elected
 
06:30:41.628 --> 06:30:41.638 align:start position:0%
representatives of the people maybe you
 
06:30:43.430 --> 06:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
should make that decision I'm likely to
 
06:30:44.690 --> 06:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
come in here and tell you it should be
 
06:30:46.970 --> 06:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
somewhere around one percent
 
06:30:48.770 --> 06:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
um and you know the utilities are
 
06:30:50.270 --> 06:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
somebody else could come in and tell you
 
06:30:52.128 --> 06:30:52.138 align:start position:0%
that it should be 10 and then you can
 
06:30:54.470 --> 06:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
make the decision because you won't make
 
06:30:56.208 --> 06:30:56.218 align:start position:0%
the decision based on science there
 
06:30:58.810 --> 06:30:58.820 align:start position:0%
isn't any science not even economics
 
06:31:01.610 --> 06:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
it's just a policy call so I think it's
 
06:31:04.548 --> 06:31:04.558 align:start position:0%
a decision you should consider making so
 
06:31:06.230 --> 06:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
where do we stand with Energy Efficiency
 
06:31:08.750 --> 06:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that above at the top
 
06:31:11.570 --> 06:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
of the slide is the logo of NH saves
 
06:31:13.850 --> 06:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
that is the trade name of our state
 
06:31:16.788 --> 06:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs uh they're
 
06:31:19.190 --> 06:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
administered by our Public Utilities
 
06:31:20.868 --> 06:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
that's a little weird when you think
 
06:31:23.030 --> 06:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
about it it's sort of like paying Dunkin
 
06:31:25.610 --> 06:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
Donuts to help people lose weight but it
 
06:31:25.620 --> 06:31:26.570 align:start position:0%
Donuts to help people lose weight but it
works

06:31:26.570 --> 06:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
works
 
06:31:28.670 --> 06:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
so we have our utilities develop the
 
06:31:31.250 --> 06:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
program in 2016 the Public Utilities
 
06:31:33.650 --> 06:31:33.660 align:start position:0%
Commission approved an Energy Efficiency
 
06:31:36.288 --> 06:31:36.298 align:start position:0%
resource standard for New Hampshire the
 
06:31:39.230 --> 06:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
idea there was to set savings goals and
 
06:31:41.270 --> 06:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
then once we set the goals develop the
 
06:31:43.610 --> 06:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
budgets and adjust the Energy Efficiency
 
06:31:46.548 --> 06:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
charges accordingly uh pursuant to that
 
06:31:49.850 --> 06:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
bit of public policy the First triennial
 
06:31:52.250 --> 06:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency plan was approved by
 
06:31:55.368 --> 06:31:55.378 align:start position:0%
the puc in 2017 and it ran for those
 
06:31:59.510 --> 06:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
three years of that plan during 2020 the
 
06:32:01.910 --> 06:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
utilities collaborated with us at the
 
06:32:04.430 --> 06:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
OCA and other stakeholders on developing
 
06:32:06.650 --> 06:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
the second triennial Energy Efficiency
 
06:32:11.048 --> 06:32:11.058 align:start position:0%
plan which the puc ended up rejecting
 
06:32:13.788 --> 06:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
316 days into the triennium on November
 
06:32:16.910 --> 06:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
12th of 2021 and not only did the puc
 
06:32:19.070 --> 06:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
reject the triennial plan
 
06:32:21.288 --> 06:32:21.298 align:start position:0%
it said we're done with the Energy
 
06:32:23.390 --> 06:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
Efficiency resource standard that's not
 
06:32:25.250 --> 06:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
our policy anymore and in fact we're
 
06:32:26.990 --> 06:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
going to phase out rate payer funded
 
06:32:29.628 --> 06:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency altogether over the
 
06:32:31.850 --> 06:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
next three years well
 
06:32:34.310 --> 06:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
to quote John Milton at that point all
 
06:32:38.330 --> 06:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
hell broke loose and meaning that from
 
06:32:41.030 --> 06:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
really across the Spectrum people began
 
06:32:43.070 --> 06:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
to point out rather emphatically the
 
06:32:44.990 --> 06:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
devastating consequences of doing that
 
06:32:47.868 --> 06:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that on February 28th
 
06:32:50.270 --> 06:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh Governor sununu signed Senate Bill
 
06:32:52.548 --> 06:32:52.558 align:start position:0%
549 into law Prime sponsor
 
06:32:56.150 --> 06:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative Vose that I think created
 
06:32:57.770 --> 06:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
a more sensible approach to Energy
 
06:33:00.410 --> 06:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
Efficiency for New Hampshire in that the
 
06:33:02.690 --> 06:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
programs were enshrined in statute but
 
06:33:04.368 --> 06:33:04.378 align:start position:0%
there were some limits placed on how
 
06:33:06.170 --> 06:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
much money how much rate payer money
 
06:33:08.288 --> 06:33:08.298 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend on them through
 
06:33:11.090 --> 06:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
non-bypassable rates that was House Bill
 
06:33:13.548 --> 06:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
a house bill excuse me did I say Senate
 
06:33:16.850 --> 06:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
bill so does your presentation apologies
 
06:33:19.310 --> 06:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
it was House Bill 549 and representative
 
06:33:23.150 --> 06:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
Vose was the lead sponsor thank you
 
06:33:23.160 --> 06:33:24.470 align:start position:0%
Vose was the lead sponsor thank you
um

06:33:24.470 --> 06:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:26.810 --> 06:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
okay so where are we now well the next
 
06:33:30.708 --> 06:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
triennial plan is due on July 1st uh the
 
06:33:32.330 --> 06:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and sustainable energy
 
06:33:34.190 --> 06:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
board is the official forum for
 
06:33:36.530 --> 06:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input into that triennial
 
06:33:39.650 --> 06:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
plan uh the puc meanwhile is conducting
 
06:33:42.470 --> 06:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
a big investigation into what we do
 
06:33:44.208 --> 06:33:44.218 align:start position:0%
about Energy Efficiency in New Hampshire
 
06:33:46.490 --> 06:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
and the big nagging problem that we're
 
06:33:48.230 --> 06:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
grappling with is the so-called 65
 
06:33:51.410 --> 06:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
electric savings problem and that is
 
06:33:55.548 --> 06:33:55.558 align:start position:0%
because in House Bill 549 it says that
 
06:33:56.930 --> 06:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
when we take money from Electric
 
06:33:59.330 --> 06:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
customers via the system benefits charge
 
06:34:02.690 --> 06:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
and spend it on Energy Efficiency at
 
06:34:04.910 --> 06:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
least 65 percent of the savings that we
 
06:34:06.948 --> 06:34:06.958 align:start position:0%
achieve by spending that money have to
 
06:34:08.868 --> 06:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
come from electricity savings rather
 
06:34:11.030 --> 06:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
than other kinds of savings meaning
 
06:34:14.510 --> 06:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
unregulated fuels so the puc read that
 
06:34:16.850 --> 06:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
and it decided to add a couple of words
 
06:34:20.030 --> 06:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
into the statute and say that that's 65
 
06:34:23.150 --> 06:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
threshold applies both to annual savings
 
06:34:26.510 --> 06:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
and life lifetime savings and it turns
 
06:34:28.610 --> 06:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
out that the lifetime savings if that is
 
06:34:32.208 --> 06:34:32.218 align:start position:0%
in fact the standard makes most home
 
06:34:34.330 --> 06:34:34.340 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs no longer
 
06:34:36.470 --> 06:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for funding because they don't
 
06:34:38.390 --> 06:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
meet that threshold why is that well
 
06:34:40.030 --> 06:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
it's for the same reason I gave before
 
06:34:42.650 --> 06:34:42.660 align:start position:0%
weatherization measures last a wicked
 
06:34:45.110 --> 06:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
long time usually about 30 years and if
 
06:34:46.910 --> 06:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
I weatherize your house unless you're
 
06:34:49.788 --> 06:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
using electric heat chances are most of
 
06:34:51.890 --> 06:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
the savings that you achieve will be
 
06:34:53.750 --> 06:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
through something other than electricity
 
06:34:55.970 --> 06:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
and so those weatherization programs
 
06:34:58.430 --> 06:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
would knock the whole system out of
 
06:35:00.410 --> 06:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
kilter with respect to Lifetime savings
 
06:35:03.170 --> 06:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
and so what the utilities will do is
 
06:35:04.670 --> 06:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
they will stop proposing home
 
06:35:08.208 --> 06:35:08.218 align:start position:0%
weatherization unless we do as has been
 
06:35:10.730 --> 06:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
proposed in a bill that you will hear
 
06:35:13.850 --> 06:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
this session and we put the word annual
 
06:35:16.010 --> 06:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
in the statute so we make clear to the
 
06:35:18.288 --> 06:35:18.298 align:start position:0%
puc that we don't want them to apply
 
06:35:21.230 --> 06:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
that threshold to Lifetime savings okay
 
06:35:23.448 --> 06:35:23.458 align:start position:0%
just a little advertisement here or
 
06:35:26.030 --> 06:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
maybe an example of what we mean by rate
 
06:35:27.890 --> 06:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
payer funded Energy Efficiency this is
 
06:35:30.708 --> 06:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
the Oyster River Middle School
 
06:35:33.670 --> 06:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
in um Portsmouth
 
06:35:38.990 --> 06:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
opened last year it is a net zero
 
06:35:41.150 --> 06:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
building that was funded by the or its
 
06:35:43.190 --> 06:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency measures were funded
 
06:35:46.368 --> 06:35:46.378 align:start position:0%
by NH saves and it is designed to
 
06:35:48.830 --> 06:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
basically produce at least as much
 
06:35:51.650 --> 06:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
energy as it consumes so how does it do
 
06:35:53.208 --> 06:35:53.218 align:start position:0%
that well it's really energy efficient
 
06:35:55.368 --> 06:35:55.378 align:start position:0%
and it has a bunch of solar panels that
 
06:35:57.230 --> 06:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
the faculty get to park underneath or
 
06:35:58.570 --> 06:35:58.580 align:start position:0%
visitors do
 
06:36:02.448 --> 06:36:02.458 align:start position:0%
and the way that the deal is structured
 
06:36:03.890 --> 06:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
they actually have to produce the
 
06:36:05.510 --> 06:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
savings or they don't get half the money
 
06:36:07.610 --> 06:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
so there's basically the school district
 
06:36:11.930 --> 06:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
has 148 thousand dollars bet on the fact
 
06:36:13.670 --> 06:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
that this project will in fact produce
 
06:36:15.890 --> 06:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
what it is supposed to produce and that
 
06:36:18.288 --> 06:36:18.298 align:start position:0%
program is called Net Zero it's an
 
06:36:22.310 --> 06:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
eversource program and that is their uh
 
06:36:25.310 --> 06:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
I guess I would call it their signal uh
 
06:36:28.128 --> 06:36:28.138 align:start position:0%
Net Zero project in New Hampshire we
 
06:36:29.448 --> 06:36:29.458 align:start position:0%
have a statute called least cost
 
06:36:31.610 --> 06:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
integrated resource planning I think
 
06:36:33.048 --> 06:36:33.058 align:start position:0%
it's a really important part of our
 
06:36:35.690 --> 06:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
public policy in New Hampshire it says
 
06:36:37.368 --> 06:36:37.378 align:start position:0%
that we expect our electric and Natural
 
06:36:40.548 --> 06:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
Gas Utilities to develop and file plans
 
06:36:42.530 --> 06:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
that meet the state's energy policy
 
06:36:45.288 --> 06:36:45.298 align:start position:0%
which is right there in the statute on a
 
06:36:47.270 --> 06:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
basis that is least cost from the
 
06:36:50.448 --> 06:36:50.458 align:start position:0%
standpoint of customers it requires the
 
06:36:53.448 --> 06:36:53.458 align:start position:0%
utilities to talk about and the puc
 
06:36:56.330 --> 06:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
ultimately to review how the utilities
 
06:36:58.910 --> 06:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
have assessed options not just capital
 
06:37:01.430 --> 06:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
projects but any options because there
 
06:37:02.690 --> 06:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
are all kinds of things the utilities
 
06:37:06.110 --> 06:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
can do to meet their service objectives
 
06:37:08.570 --> 06:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
without necessarily investing in more
 
06:37:11.270 --> 06:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
toys you know and rate design is an
 
06:37:13.548 --> 06:37:13.558 align:start position:0%
example of that so we expect the
 
06:37:14.990 --> 06:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
utilities to file these least cost
 
06:37:17.510 --> 06:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
integrated resource plans we expect the
 
06:37:19.788 --> 06:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
puc to review them for consistency and
 
06:37:22.010 --> 06:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
consistency with the statute but for as
 
06:37:23.570 --> 06:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
long as I've been involved in this the
 
06:37:26.510 --> 06:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
puc has been misapplying the statute and
 
06:37:28.128 --> 06:37:28.138 align:start position:0%
has been essentially treating least cost
 
06:37:29.868 --> 06:37:29.878 align:start position:0%
integrated resource plans as if they're
 
06:37:32.750 --> 06:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
kind of book reports well I can
 
06:37:34.970 --> 06:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
understand why the puc has done that
 
06:37:37.128 --> 06:37:37.138 align:start position:0%
least cost integrated resource planning
 
06:37:41.628 --> 06:37:41.638 align:start position:0%
is a creature of the pre-restructuring
 
06:37:44.590 --> 06:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
era of Public Utilities but I think that
 
06:37:47.990 --> 06:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
we can we can adapt least cost
 
06:37:50.510 --> 06:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
integrated resource planning to meet the
 
06:37:52.190 --> 06:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
current legal and technological
 
06:37:56.448 --> 06:37:56.458 align:start position:0%
realities and so what we have is a model
 
06:37:58.430 --> 06:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
that says the utilities file their lease
 
06:38:01.070 --> 06:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
cost plans they tell the epuc what
 
06:38:03.170 --> 06:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
they're gonna do then they file rate
 
06:38:05.330 --> 06:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
cases to tell the puc what they did do
 
06:38:07.910 --> 06:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
and if they did it prudently and if they
 
06:38:09.650 --> 06:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
built assets that are used and useful
 
06:38:12.650 --> 06:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
they get rate recovery and so if we're
 
06:38:14.448 --> 06:38:14.458 align:start position:0%
vigorous about the least cost planning
 
06:38:17.570 --> 06:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
process we can provide more certainty
 
06:38:19.548 --> 06:38:19.558 align:start position:0%
for the utilities which their
 
06:38:21.590 --> 06:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
shareholders will like and also more
 
06:38:23.868 --> 06:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
accountability which hopefully the rest
 
06:38:26.990 --> 06:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
of us will like so there is a bill in
 
06:38:28.970 --> 06:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
the legislature this term it'll be a
 
06:38:30.590 --> 06:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
house bill that calls for the outright
 
06:38:33.288 --> 06:38:33.298 align:start position:0%
repeal of the least cost integrated
 
06:38:35.270 --> 06:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
resource planning statute I I
 
06:38:37.010 --> 06:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
unabashedly hope to convince you to
 
06:38:41.090 --> 06:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
replace that with a rewrite of the lcirp
 
06:38:43.490 --> 06:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
statute that makes it actually work
 
06:38:46.670 --> 06:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
a signal initiative of my office is the
 
06:38:48.910 --> 06:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide utility customer data platform
 
06:38:51.230 --> 06:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that I can't honor
 
06:38:52.788 --> 06:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
representative McGee because she's not
 
06:38:55.730 --> 06:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
in the room but she was the champion of
 
06:38:58.250 --> 06:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 284 that was a Senate bill
 
06:39:01.430 --> 06:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
this time but representative McGee
 
06:39:03.288 --> 06:39:03.298 align:start position:0%
championed it here in this committee it
 
06:39:05.990 --> 06:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
was adopted by the legislature it said
 
06:39:08.530 --> 06:39:08.540 align:start position:0%
to the puc we think this data platform
 
06:39:11.990 --> 06:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
idea is a good one and why is it a good
 
06:39:18.430 --> 06:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
idea because if we allow customers to
 
06:39:22.490 --> 06:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
share their energy data usage with
 
06:39:25.010 --> 06:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
providers of unregulated innovative
 
06:39:27.590 --> 06:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
Retail Energy Services they'll save
 
06:39:31.548 --> 06:39:31.558 align:start position:0%
money and become more empowered uh and
 
06:39:33.410 --> 06:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
freedom oriented I guess you could say
 
06:39:36.230 --> 06:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
users of the electricity grid and the
 
06:39:37.610 --> 06:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
natural gas system
 
06:39:39.410 --> 06:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
so the bill said that that was a good
 
06:39:41.628 --> 06:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
idea told the puc to open a docket to
 
06:39:43.368 --> 06:39:43.378 align:start position:0%
consider it we reached a settlement
 
06:39:45.170 --> 06:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
agreement with all the stakeholders even
 
06:39:47.390 --> 06:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
the utilities I was sure the utilities
 
06:39:49.010 --> 06:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
were going to try to kill this whole
 
06:39:51.650 --> 06:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
initiative I was wrong they're actually
 
06:39:53.448 --> 06:39:53.458 align:start position:0%
very enthusiastic about it so they're
 
06:39:55.610 --> 06:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
working with us we created a governance
 
06:39:58.190 --> 06:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
Council so that the utilities don't get
 
06:40:00.230 --> 06:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
to do whatever they want they have to
 
06:40:03.350 --> 06:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
live with or work with stakeholders and
 
06:40:05.690 --> 06:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input and the statute says
 
06:40:08.030 --> 06:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
the puc can stop the project if it
 
06:40:10.010 --> 06:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
determines that the costs are excessive
 
06:40:11.628 --> 06:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
thereby providing a measure of
 
06:40:13.610 --> 06:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
protection so that it doesn't doesn't
 
06:40:16.250 --> 06:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
become a blank check
 
06:40:18.530 --> 06:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
okay just briefly I just want to tell
 
06:40:19.970 --> 06:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
you what I'm going to be hoping to see
 
06:40:22.490 --> 06:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
happen in the legislature this year as I
 
06:40:24.288 --> 06:40:24.298 align:start position:0%
said earlier I'd like to see reform not
 
06:40:25.970 --> 06:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
repeal of the least cost planning
 
06:40:28.190 --> 06:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
statute I'd like to solve that 65
 
06:40:31.128 --> 06:40:31.138 align:start position:0%
lifetime electric savings problem I
 
06:40:33.288 --> 06:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
would like to tell the puc and there
 
06:40:34.910 --> 06:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
will be a bill starting in the Senate
 
06:40:38.288 --> 06:40:38.298 align:start position:0%
that does this to tell the puc that
 
06:40:41.030 --> 06:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
regulating the data platform project is
 
06:40:43.368 --> 06:40:43.378 align:start position:0%
not the same as managing it and I'm
 
06:40:45.350 --> 06:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
sorry that we have to remind the POC of
 
06:40:47.770 --> 06:40:47.780 align:start position:0%
that but that will be necessary
 
06:40:51.170 --> 06:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
I know that the legislature is very keen
 
06:40:53.628 --> 06:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
this year on reforming the facility
 
06:40:56.868 --> 06:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
citing process and I am an enthusiastic
 
06:40:59.868 --> 06:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
supporter of that initiative why because
 
06:41:02.868 --> 06:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
it's obvious that no matter what policy
 
06:41:06.530 --> 06:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
outcomes you favor in order to meet the
 
06:41:08.628 --> 06:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
energy needs of this state's ratepayers
 
06:41:10.910 --> 06:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
in the future we need more
 
06:41:13.250 --> 06:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of any number of types
 
06:41:15.048 --> 06:41:15.058 align:start position:0%
you know whether you think the answer is
 
06:41:17.030 --> 06:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
more transmission so so that we can move
 
06:41:19.070 --> 06:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
more electricity in from Canada or
 
06:41:20.090 --> 06:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
whether you think we should be building
 
06:41:22.128 --> 06:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
nuclear power plants if they're cost
 
06:41:23.690 --> 06:41:23.700 align:start position:0%
effective or whether you like wind
 
06:41:25.730 --> 06:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
turbines no matter what it is that you
 
06:41:27.708 --> 06:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
think is the cool technology that you
 
06:41:29.810 --> 06:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
favor we need to be able to build those
 
06:41:32.270 --> 06:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
things here in New Hampshire and right
 
06:41:36.288 --> 06:41:36.298 align:start position:0%
now that is very very very difficult to
 
06:41:38.570 --> 06:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
do such that the companies that would
 
06:41:40.970 --> 06:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
have to put Capital At Risk to do that
 
06:41:43.910 --> 06:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that well that's bad so
 
06:41:46.310 --> 06:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
we need to figure out ways to make it
 
06:41:48.590 --> 06:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
possible to build these things and I'm
 
06:41:50.208 --> 06:41:50.218 align:start position:0%
really glad the legislature is going to
 
06:41:52.010 --> 06:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
take a look at that and you can look to
 
06:41:54.890 --> 06:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
me to be an enthusiastic partner in that
 
06:41:57.470 --> 06:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
process and finally I think it's time to
 
06:41:59.330 --> 06:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
start exploring this concept called
 
06:42:02.330 --> 06:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
transactive Energy and that just means
 
06:42:04.730 --> 06:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
turning retail energy into something
 
06:42:06.830 --> 06:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
that looks a lot like wholesale energy
 
06:42:09.350 --> 06:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
so imagine if Just the Way Wholesale
 
06:42:11.868 --> 06:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
producers can trade and sell electricity
 
06:42:14.330 --> 06:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
and have it be bought by wholesale
 
06:42:15.890 --> 06:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
pliers imagine if we could do that at
 
06:42:17.990 --> 06:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
reach detail so that you could sell your
 
06:42:19.548 --> 06:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
electricity that you're producing on
 
06:42:21.890 --> 06:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
your rooftop or in your backyard or
 
06:42:23.330 --> 06:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
through some other means to your
 
06:42:26.690 --> 06:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
neighbors and vice versa I think we need
 
06:42:28.788 --> 06:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
to explore that to be frank I'm not sure
 
06:42:30.890 --> 06:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
exactly how we need to do that but it's
 
06:42:32.930 --> 06:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
an important policy initiative to look
 
06:42:35.810 --> 06:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
at implementing and then our regulatory
 
06:42:37.368 --> 06:42:37.378 align:start position:0%
priorities what do we want to see happen
 
06:42:40.610 --> 06:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
at the puc I want to see the puc approve
 
06:42:42.770 --> 06:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
a robust triangular Energy Efficiency
 
06:42:46.010 --> 06:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
plan after it's filed in July I would
 
06:42:47.930 --> 06:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
like to see the utility customer data
 
06:42:50.270 --> 06:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
platform move forward without too much
 
06:42:52.208 --> 06:42:52.218 align:start position:0%
puc interference
 
06:42:54.830 --> 06:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
I do think that we are finally in a
 
06:42:56.890 --> 06:42:56.900 align:start position:0%
position to come up with a permanent
 
06:43:00.708 --> 06:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
formula for how we compensate producers
 
06:43:04.310 --> 06:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
of distributed energy meaning metering I
 
06:43:06.350 --> 06:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
think that we have to apply the lcirp
 
06:43:08.690 --> 06:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
statute correctly rather than just as a
 
06:43:10.310 --> 06:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism to require utilities to file
 
06:43:12.610 --> 06:43:12.620 align:start position:0%
book reports every three or four years
 
06:43:15.350 --> 06:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
we clearly need to take a hard look at
 
06:43:17.390 --> 06:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
how we procure default Energy Service
 
06:43:19.548 --> 06:43:19.558 align:start position:0%
how do I know that well the New
 
06:43:21.830 --> 06:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric Co-op just reduced
 
06:43:24.288 --> 06:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
its default Energy Service rate down to
 
06:43:25.730 --> 06:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
13 cents
 
06:43:27.410 --> 06:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
it was already way ahead of everybody
 
06:43:29.990 --> 06:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
else at 17 cents I thought for a while
 
06:43:32.030 --> 06:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
that rate's not long for this world but
 
06:43:33.350 --> 06:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
lo and behold they turned around and
 
06:43:35.690 --> 06:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
said that as of January 1st we're
 
06:43:38.628 --> 06:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
reducing it to 13 cents that's half of
 
06:43:40.070 --> 06:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
the rate that one of the other utilities
 
06:43:42.410 --> 06:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
is charging so clearly the Electric
 
06:43:44.990 --> 06:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
Co-op is doing something that the puc
 
06:43:46.548 --> 06:43:46.558 align:start position:0%
should be telling the investor on
 
06:43:49.310 --> 06:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
utilities they should be doing in Maine
 
06:43:51.530 --> 06:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
the default Energy Service rate that
 
06:43:52.788 --> 06:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
just went into effect it's called
 
06:43:55.190 --> 06:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
standard offer over there is either 16
 
06:43:57.530 --> 06:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
or 17 cents depending on which of their
 
06:43:59.448 --> 06:43:59.458 align:start position:0%
two big utilities you're talking about
 
06:44:03.288 --> 06:44:03.298 align:start position:0%
so even the investor on Utilities in the
 
06:44:05.090 --> 06:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
state that's nearby and most like ours
 
06:44:07.490 --> 06:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
they're also beating our utilities I
 
06:44:08.930 --> 06:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
just want to stress because I know there
 
06:44:10.548 --> 06:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
are utility representatives in the room
 
06:44:12.770 --> 06:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
this is not their fault
 
06:44:15.410 --> 06:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
the utilities are only doing what the
 
06:44:17.810 --> 06:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
puc has told them to do we need to
 
06:44:19.788 --> 06:44:19.798 align:start position:0%
figure out what we can tell them to do
 
06:44:21.650 --> 06:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
that will be different and better and
 
06:44:23.930 --> 06:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
the puc has an open investigation for
 
06:44:25.910 --> 06:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
doing that and when the puc comes here
 
06:44:27.770 --> 06:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
you should encourage them to act on that
 
06:44:30.350 --> 06:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
as vigorously and effectively and
 
06:44:32.510 --> 06:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
quickly as they can because these
 
06:44:34.368 --> 06:44:34.378 align:start position:0%
default Energy Service rates are too
 
06:44:36.890 --> 06:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
high of course we need to make sure that
 
06:44:38.150 --> 06:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
people who are having trouble paying
 
06:44:39.830 --> 06:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
their electric bills and their natural
 
06:44:43.730 --> 06:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
gas bills have a way to do that we have
 
06:44:46.010 --> 06:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
energy assistance programs for both
 
06:44:48.650 --> 06:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
electric and natural gas customers we
 
06:44:49.970 --> 06:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that those remain
 
06:44:52.430 --> 06:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
vibrant and although I didn't put it in
 
06:44:55.250 --> 06:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
my slide deck uh I do think that this is
 
06:44:56.570 --> 06:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
going to be the year of community power
 
06:45:00.650 --> 06:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
aggregation uh if done correctly it may
 
06:45:02.628 --> 06:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
very well finally deliver to residential
 
06:45:04.910 --> 06:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
customers the benefits of restructuring
 
06:45:07.190 --> 06:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
for which they have paid hundreds of
 
06:45:09.048 --> 06:45:09.058 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in stranded costs
 
06:45:11.150 --> 06:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
it's not a guarantee but I think it
 
06:45:13.610 --> 06:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
might happen and I think we should keep
 
06:45:17.270 --> 06:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
a careful eye on how those projects work
 
06:45:20.330 --> 06:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh and I also have Federal and Regional
 
06:45:21.890 --> 06:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
priorities that basically involve
 
06:45:26.030 --> 06:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
opening up to more sunlight the uh both
 
06:45:29.390 --> 06:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
ice and New England and Nepal and I
 
06:45:30.530 --> 06:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to gloss over those
 
06:45:31.730 --> 06:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
right now in the interest of time
 
06:45:33.590 --> 06:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
because I know everybody must be getting
 
06:45:35.448 --> 06:45:35.458 align:start position:0%
tired but I'll be happy to come back and
 
06:45:37.010 --> 06:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
talk about those whenever you want
 
06:45:38.868 --> 06:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
because those are really important why
 
06:45:40.368 --> 06:45:40.378 align:start position:0%
is it important because that's really
 
06:45:42.770 --> 06:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
where all the money is these days in
 
06:45:45.170 --> 06:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
these wholesale energy and transmission
 
06:45:45.180 --> 06:45:46.730 align:start position:0%
these wholesale energy and transmission
realms

06:45:46.730 --> 06:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
realms
 
06:45:48.650 --> 06:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
and finally I'm an architecture buff so
 
06:45:50.690 --> 06:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
I decided to throw this slide in and ask
 
06:45:52.670 --> 06:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
you to tell me which of these four
 
06:45:54.948 --> 06:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
pictures shows a building that is not
 
06:46:01.368 --> 06:46:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:03.610 --> 06:46:03.620 align:start position:0%
this is apropos of absolutely nothing
 
06:46:05.750 --> 06:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you that the building
 
06:46:07.490 --> 06:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
that is not located in New Hampshire is
 
06:46:09.170 --> 06:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
the one in the upper left that happens
 
06:46:11.030 --> 06:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
to be a building called The Chateau it's
 
06:46:13.190 --> 06:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
located at my alma mater Middlebury
 
06:46:15.530 --> 06:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
College in a different state it's the
 
06:46:16.910 --> 06:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
most traditional looking thing there
 
06:46:19.070 --> 06:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
everything else is located in New
 
06:46:21.770 --> 06:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on the lower left is that new
 
06:46:23.510 --> 06:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
bridge that they built across Portsmouth
 
06:46:26.030 --> 06:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
Harbor on the lower right is a public
 
06:46:28.010 --> 06:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
housing project in Manchester and in the
 
06:46:29.628 --> 06:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
upper left is the coolest building in
 
06:46:31.430 --> 06:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the library of the
 
06:46:33.770 --> 06:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
Phillips Exeter Academy designed by the
 
06:46:35.390 --> 06:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
best American architect of the 20th
 
06:46:37.548 --> 06:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
century Louis Khan we're very fortunate
 
06:46:40.010 --> 06:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
to have it here and on the bottom of
 
06:46:41.570 --> 06:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
that slide deck and also on the first
 
06:46:43.128 --> 06:46:43.138 align:start position:0%
slide of the slide deck is my contact
 
06:46:46.670 --> 06:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
info I love talking to legislators and
 
06:46:48.830 --> 06:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
here's a promise that I'll make to you I
 
06:46:50.810 --> 06:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
love helping legislators do what they
 
06:46:53.570 --> 06:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
want to do I love drafting bills I will
 
06:46:56.330 --> 06:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
help you do whatever you want to do you
 
06:46:58.730 --> 06:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
can call me up and say Don I need help
 
06:47:01.730 --> 06:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
drafting an amendment or a bill and even
 
06:47:03.708 --> 06:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
if it's something that I know is wrong
 
06:47:06.530 --> 06:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
that I just flat out disagree with I
 
06:47:08.690 --> 06:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
will still help you do it because even
 
06:47:10.968 --> 06:47:10.978 align:start position:0%
if you adopt public policy that I think
 
06:47:13.610 --> 06:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
is wrong-headed I still want it to be in
 
06:47:15.890 --> 06:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
statutes that are clear well written
 
06:47:18.110 --> 06:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
with standards that we can apply
 
06:47:19.850 --> 06:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully and sensibly and frankly
 
06:47:22.190 --> 06:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
correctly and so I'm committed to
 
06:47:23.750 --> 06:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
helping you all do that I think that's
 
06:47:25.128 --> 06:47:25.138 align:start position:0%
everything I have to say and then some
 
06:47:26.750 --> 06:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any more
 
06:47:28.910 --> 06:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
questions that you want to offer if the
 
06:47:31.070 --> 06:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
Chairman's willing to call in you to ask
 
06:47:33.288 --> 06:47:33.298 align:start position:0%
them yes we'll take a couple before we
 
06:47:35.708 --> 06:47:35.718 align:start position:0%
leave Don and thank you for a fantastic
 
06:47:38.868 --> 06:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
presentation as usual representative
 
06:47:41.628 --> 06:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas has a question thank you
 
06:47:43.850 --> 06:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
very much you said that you're the
 
06:47:46.490 --> 06:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
advocate for the residential consumers
 
06:47:49.128 --> 06:47:49.138 align:start position:0%
oh I was going to move I think it's time
 
06:47:50.868 --> 06:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
for me to move I didn't I've been
 
06:47:52.368 --> 06:47:52.378 align:start position:0%
getting up out of your chair too much oh
 
06:47:54.708 --> 06:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
that's okay is there a comparable office
 
06:47:57.350 --> 06:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
for cni and who advocates for the
 
06:47:58.968 --> 06:47:58.978 align:start position:0%
municipalities that's a really great
 
06:48:00.770 --> 06:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
question and the answer is no there is
 
06:48:03.350 --> 06:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
not uh again you know in Maine the
 
06:48:05.750 --> 06:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
public Advocate has all customers to
 
06:48:07.610 --> 06:48:07.620 align:start position:0%
think of and take care of I think the
 
06:48:09.890 --> 06:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
theory when our office was constituted
 
06:48:11.868 --> 06:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
as the residential rate payer Advocate
 
06:48:14.628 --> 06:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
is that the big cni customers tend to be
 
06:48:16.730 --> 06:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
able to take care of themselves we see
 
06:48:19.190 --> 06:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
less of that lately it used to be that
 
06:48:21.048 --> 06:48:21.058 align:start position:0%
some of the big commercial and
 
06:48:23.990 --> 06:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
Industrial customers used to appear at
 
06:48:26.208 --> 06:48:26.218 align:start position:0%
the puc to kind of flex their muscles
 
06:48:28.250 --> 06:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
and assert their interests I've been
 
06:48:30.350 --> 06:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
encouraging the business and industry
 
06:48:32.448 --> 06:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
Association to take a more active role
 
06:48:34.610 --> 06:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
at the puc and I I think they're open to
 
06:48:36.110 --> 06:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
that we have a very good relationship
 
06:48:39.530 --> 06:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
with the new leadership at the Bia and I
 
06:48:42.410 --> 06:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
I hope to see more commercial and
 
06:48:45.310 --> 06:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
Industrial consumer advocacy at the puc
 
06:48:47.448 --> 06:48:47.458 align:start position:0%
one question that comes up occasionally
 
06:48:50.448 --> 06:48:50.458 align:start position:0%
is do you amend the OCA statute so that
 
06:48:52.310 --> 06:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
we have that Charter and that's
 
06:48:53.990 --> 06:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
something to think about
 
06:48:56.150 --> 06:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
um we could talk about that
 
06:48:59.208 --> 06:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan has a question
 
06:49:01.910 --> 06:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm intrigued by the
 
06:49:04.430 --> 06:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
default Energy service and and when you
 
06:49:05.570 --> 06:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned the fact that the Electric
 
06:49:07.910 --> 06:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
Co-op for instance has rates that are
 
06:49:09.890 --> 06:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
half of what our utilities are are
 
06:49:12.590 --> 06:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
charging uh per kilowatt and I just
 
06:49:14.570 --> 06:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to know what your opinion is is
 
06:49:16.850 --> 06:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
really an opinion question uh do you how
 
06:49:19.750 --> 06:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
confident are you in the puc
 
06:49:22.850 --> 06:49:22.860 align:start position:0%
puc's ability to look into that in an
 
06:49:24.830 --> 06:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
effective manner when they issued their
 
06:49:24.840 --> 06:49:26.750 align:start position:0%
effective manner when they issued their
report

06:49:26.750 --> 06:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
report
 
06:49:28.968 --> 06:49:28.978 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have any lack of confidence
 
06:49:32.810 --> 06:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
in the puc's ability to vigorously look
 
06:49:36.230 --> 06:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
at what all the available options are
 
06:49:38.930 --> 06:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
um do you want me to opine on what I
 
06:49:41.090 --> 06:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
think we should do well I'll just say
 
06:49:43.910 --> 06:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
this first of all it's true that we've
 
06:49:45.830 --> 06:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
seen default Energy Service rates up to
 
06:49:47.990 --> 06:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
26 Cents eversource is about to move
 
06:49:50.330 --> 06:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
theirs down to 20 cents so I think
 
06:49:52.310 --> 06:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
really the good comparison might be 13
 
06:49:54.650 --> 06:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
to 20. that's still a pretty big Delta
 
06:49:57.230 --> 06:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
what's the difference well the Electric
 
06:49:59.930 --> 06:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
Co-op is actively managing its
 
06:50:02.090 --> 06:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
electricity portfolio what we've told
 
06:50:04.610 --> 06:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
our investor own utilities to do is to
 
06:50:06.948 --> 06:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
put out an RFP every six months and the
 
06:50:09.590 --> 06:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
price that you get is entirely based on
 
06:50:12.350 --> 06:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
what bidders are willing to propose on
 
06:50:14.810 --> 06:50:14.820 align:start position:0%
whatever day their bizer do and if your
 
06:50:17.990 --> 06:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
RFP if the responses are due in a bad
 
06:50:20.570 --> 06:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
week you get really bad prices that's
 
06:50:23.208 --> 06:50:23.218 align:start position:0%
how we got 26 Cents so if you luck out
 
06:50:25.190 --> 06:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
and hit the market on a good week then
 
06:50:27.350 --> 06:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
you get better price it shouldn't come
 
06:50:30.468 --> 06:50:30.478 align:start position:0%
down to that kind of good or bad luck so
 
06:50:33.890 --> 06:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
I think we need to find ways to get our
 
06:50:36.230 --> 06:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
utilities to manage their default Energy
 
06:50:39.070 --> 06:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
Service portfolio more
 
06:50:41.810 --> 06:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
aggressively and vigilantly but we could
 
06:50:44.448 --> 06:50:44.458 align:start position:0%
adopt a whole different uh um we could
 
06:50:46.190 --> 06:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
adopt a whole different Paradigm as Tom
 
06:50:48.288 --> 06:50:48.298 align:start position:0%
Frantz mentioned we could use a live
 
06:50:50.510 --> 06:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
descending clock auction and there are
 
06:50:52.070 --> 06:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
reasons to think about doing that that
 
06:50:54.170 --> 06:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
have to do with the economics and I
 
06:50:56.570 --> 06:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
guess the psychology of of bidding so
 
06:51:01.368 --> 06:51:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:04.070 --> 06:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you Mr
 
06:51:06.110 --> 06:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
chairman just a quick question to make
 
06:51:08.930 --> 06:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
sure I heard you correctly the co the
 
06:51:12.110 --> 06:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
co-op is not regulated by the puc is
 
06:51:13.788 --> 06:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct back in
 
06:51:16.548 --> 06:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
about 2001 I think it was the
 
06:51:18.830 --> 06:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
legislature passed a bill that said that
 
06:51:21.048 --> 06:51:21.058 align:start position:0%
the membership of the Cooperative could
 
06:51:24.170 --> 06:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
vote to file a so-called certificate of
 
06:51:26.628 --> 06:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
deregulation with the puc and the
 
06:51:28.788 --> 06:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
membership of the co-op voted to do that
 
06:51:31.310 --> 06:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
and so it's not and the reason I'm
 
06:51:33.048 --> 06:51:33.058 align:start position:0%
particular about this is It's not that
 
06:51:35.150 --> 06:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
the co-op is no longer regulated it's
 
06:51:37.250 --> 06:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
that the members of the co-op who own
 
06:51:40.250 --> 06:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
and use that utility have exercised
 
06:51:43.368 --> 06:51:43.378 align:start position:0%
their right to remove most of their
 
06:51:45.468 --> 06:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
utility from puc oversight they could
 
06:51:47.330 --> 06:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
change their minds
 
06:51:50.030 --> 06:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
um there are in Vermont for example
 
06:51:51.948 --> 06:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
Vermont has two electric co-ops they are
 
06:51:54.530 --> 06:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
regulated exactly the same as investor
 
06:51:56.030 --> 06:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
and utilities are
 
06:51:59.330 --> 06:51:59.340 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up follow-up so that would
 
06:52:01.910 --> 06:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
mean that the so the only two utilities
 
06:52:03.770 --> 06:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
then are Unitil and eversource correct
 
06:52:06.468 --> 06:52:06.478 align:start position:0%
well yes but they all have different
 
06:52:08.448 --> 06:52:08.458 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries depending on which industry
 
06:52:11.230 --> 06:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
there are so there are actually
 
06:52:13.670 --> 06:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
four there's
 
06:52:15.468 --> 06:52:15.478 align:start position:0%
well there's five there's eversource
 
06:52:17.930 --> 06:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
there's Liberty's electric affiliate
 
06:52:19.548 --> 06:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
there's a Liberties natural gas
 
06:52:21.530 --> 06:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
affiliate and then there's a electric
 
06:52:23.750 --> 06:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
and natural gas affiliative Unitil and
 
06:52:24.948 --> 06:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
then of course we have water companies
 
06:52:26.390 --> 06:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
as well that are regulated I was
 
06:52:27.830 --> 06:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
referring thinking mostly of electric
 
06:52:31.910 --> 06:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:34.368 --> 06:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
06:52:36.708 --> 06:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
it's actually for you Mr chairman um I
 
06:52:38.628 --> 06:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
have to leave because I have an
 
06:52:38.638 --> 06:52:40.250 align:start position:0%
have to leave because I have an
appointment

06:52:40.250 --> 06:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
06:52:43.010 --> 06:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to apologize for the
 
06:52:44.990 --> 06:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
times today that I made comments that
 
06:52:47.570 --> 06:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
were not actual questions and that goes
 
06:52:48.948 --> 06:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
against the rules that you set at the
 
06:52:51.170 --> 06:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
beginning of the meeting
 
06:52:54.190 --> 06:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
um so I ask for your forgiveness and
 
06:52:57.230 --> 06:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
goodbye for today you are forgiven and
 
06:52:59.570 --> 06:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you but before any of you leave I
 
06:53:02.390 --> 06:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
would just like to correct an oversight
 
06:53:06.048 --> 06:53:06.058 align:start position:0%
from earlier today when I neglected to
 
06:53:08.628 --> 06:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
introduce our committee researcher to
 
06:53:11.390 --> 06:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
everybody who's assembled here she's
 
06:53:13.010 --> 06:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
back there in the back if you'll stand
 
06:53:16.730 --> 06:53:16.740 align:start position:0%
up Christy this is Christy offreser did
 
06:53:18.468 --> 06:53:18.478 align:start position:0%
I pronounce that right
 
06:53:20.930 --> 06:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
she's our new committee researcher and
 
06:53:23.390 --> 06:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
we're glad to have her here so stop by
 
06:53:26.030 --> 06:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
and say hi to Christy on your way out
 
06:53:28.548 --> 06:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
the door and I'm sure we'll be taking
 
06:53:31.968 --> 06:53:31.978 align:start position:0%
advantage of her expertise as the
 
06:53:34.548 --> 06:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
session rolls on
 
06:53:37.910 --> 06:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
and see no other questions for the
 
06:53:39.530 --> 06:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate I would like to thank
 
06:53:41.750 --> 06:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
you heartily Don for a wonderful
 
06:53:43.430 --> 06:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you all for being
 
06:53:46.910 --> 06:53:46.920 align:start position:0%

06:53:53.040 --> 06:53:54.468 align:start position:0%
17th of January at 10 A.M for further
presentations

06:53:54.468 --> 06:53:54.478 align:start position:0%
