i'm a relatively new commissioner i've
 
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
only been uh with the state about ten
 
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
and a half months
 
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
and we have provided you all a copy of
 
00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
our slide deck
 
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
the first five or six slides
 
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
deal generally with administration of
 
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
the department and i'm happy to go
 
00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
through that
 
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
if some of your members are interested
 
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
in where our legislative regulatory
 
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
authority comes from and what the
 
00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
we have nine new members on the
 
00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
committee so i would suggest you go to
 
00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
them perfect um so i think you can see
 
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
normally running the slides for me as i
 
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
as i chat um it'll only take me a few
 
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
minutes to go through these
 
00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
you can see the mission of the
 
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
department there and the key the key uh
 
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
provision is to promote the public good
 
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
by ensuring the existence of a safe and
 
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
competitive insurance marketplace
 
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
through the development for enforcement
 
00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire insurance laws
 
00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
we're committed to doing that in an
 
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a unique distinction
 
00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
we were the first
 
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
insurance regulatory agency in the
 
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
united states
 
00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
and our regulatory authority is codified
 
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
in rsa 400 through 420 n
 
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important here to just
 
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
note that a virtually all insurance is
 
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
regulated at the state level
 
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
and even though uh the regulation of
 
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
insurance is replicated uh 56 times
 
00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
other authorities dc and the islands um
 
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
all of that authority
 
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
and administration
 
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
happens at each and every state level
 
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
and so with the exception of
 
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
some direction we get on things like the
 
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
affordable care act
 
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
almost everything is done at our state
 
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
level which provides us a tremendous
 
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
amount of autonomy here in new hampshire
 
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
to protect our new hampshire consumers
 
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
to ensure that products are appropriate
 
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
for our citizens
 
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
and that we have the flexibility to
 
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
to regulate those entities at the state
 
00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.990 align:start position:0%
to regulate those entities at the state
level

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's something that i'm very
 
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
proud of that as a nation we've
 
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
continued to
 
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
kind of protect that regulatory
 
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
we're charged with the enforcement of
 
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
all insurance laws for the state of new
 
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire and that includes collection
 
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
of premium taxes fees regulations of
 
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
insurance companies producers
 
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
consultants and insurance and adjusters
 
00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
and when you think about um how big of a
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
group of people that is it's it's
 
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
shocking there are over 1200 insurance
 
00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
companies that are licensed to sell a
 
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
product here in new hampshire uh some of
 
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
them are licensed to sell a variety
 
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
dozens or hundreds of products
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
and some have very unique products but
 
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
1200 separate companies have chosen to
 
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
to sell their products here in new
 
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.910 align:start position:0%
to sell their products here in new
hampshire

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 align:start position:0%
and those products are sold almost
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
entirely through producers or agents and
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire licenses 6 500 of our own
 
00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
citizens as
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
insurance producers
 
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
and nearly 90 000 other uh producers
 
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
around the nation
 
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.630 align:start position:0%
around the nation
who

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
who have reason to sell some product
 
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
here in the state and so they need to
 
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 align:start position:0%
maintain licenses with each state that
 
00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
they they do that
 
00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
in addition to the producers we also
 
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
we also license here in the state all
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
insurance adjusters and those are people
 
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
typically who are settling insurance
 
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.149 align:start position:0%
typically who are settling insurance
claims

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
generally they work for insurance
 
00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:00.390 align:start position:0%
generally they work for insurance
companies

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh but there are such things as public
 
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
adjusters or uh independent contractor
 
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.830 align:start position:0%
adjusters or uh independent contractor
adjusters

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
adjusters
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
and there are about 800 of those that
 
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
are resident adjusters and some 75 000
 
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
others that are out of state so in total
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
our licensing division here at the
 
00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.430 align:start position:0%
our licensing division here at the
department

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
handles almost 200 000 individual
 
00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
licenses a year
 
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
we have a division here at the
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
department that reviews
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
all form and rate and so every insurance
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
company form that you get annually with
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
your different insurance products
 
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
we review to ensure because oftentimes
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies are national
 
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.950 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies are national
players

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
players
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
and to ensure that those forms comply
 
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
with each and every provision that our
 
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislature has seen fit to require
 
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh for um standard uh coverages
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
and so each each form uh is reviewed
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
anytime a company develops a rating
 
00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 align:start position:0%
structure for a determining premium
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
for a particular policy we have
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
actuaries here that review those uh
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
analysis to ensure that the rate
 
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
is both
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
fair that there's not too much upside
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
for the company in it but also that it
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
is that it provides enough rate for the
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
company to pay the projected claims
 
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.550 align:start position:0%
company to pay the projected claims
um

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
obviously that's that's very complicated
 
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
work and our team here does a phenomenal
 
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
job of that
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
because it's not just about a lowest
 
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
rate you want to ensure that these
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
companies will have sufficient reserves
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
pay the claims
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
and that leads us to our oversight roles
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
we have a financial examination and
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
analysis division
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
what they look at are companies doing
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
business in new hampshire do they have
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
adequate reserves are they reporting
 
00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
their balance sheets appropriately are
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
they accounting for
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
a good data and bad debt and the value
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
of their investments appropriately so
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
that we know
 
00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
how financially stable those companies
 
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.670 align:start position:0%
how financially stable those companies
are

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
we have a division here that does market
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
conduct analysis and exams and those
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
generally come or come away uh come to
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
us in one of two ways we do some
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
proactive exams where we want to make we
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
want to test and make sure companies are
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
applying their rating structures
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
appropriately that they're paying claims
 
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
as required
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
that they're not being discriminatory in
 
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
their practices
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
and so when we do that proactively it's
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
just a review of the marketplace to to
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
their products and their application of
 
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
their products is done in a fair manner
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
and then the other version of mark
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
analysis will do is if we notice claims
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
coming in or complaints coming in about
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
a particular company or
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
settlement practice we may do a targeted
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
exam at a company because we're
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
concerned with uh with those complaints
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
and we have a team here that um
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
actually two teams here one in life and
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
health and one in pnc
 
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.309 align:start position:0%
health and one in pnc
that

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
can review those
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
company procedures and policies
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
we also have a very small division here
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
that investigates and prosecutes
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
insurance fraud
 
00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:10.870 align:start position:0%
insurance fraud
um

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
anybody can make a referral to our
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
department for a potential insurance
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
fraud typically those referrals will
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
come from
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
uh insurance companies they'll see a a
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
claim or a series of claims that raise
 
00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.830 align:start position:0%
claim or a series of claims that raise
concerns

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
and they can refer them to us and in a
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
typical year about 240
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
insurance fraud claims are referred to
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
our team
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
our team will look at the facts maybe
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
we'll do
 
00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.350 align:start position:0%
we'll do
investigation

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.550 align:start position:0%
investigation
interview

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
interview
 
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
interview
witnesses

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
witnesses
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
and in about 10 of those uh referrals
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
they find sufficient facts to refer that
 
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
case to the prosecutors for prosecution
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh and those can range anything from
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know completely
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
made up
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
insurance claims uh people claiming an
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
injury or a damage that never existed
 
00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:05.990 align:start position:0%
injury or a damage that never existed
um

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes we'll see somebody who who
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
chooses not to have insurance and gets
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
in an accident try to uh what we call
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
past post they try to buy insurance
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
after the accident
 
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.749 align:start position:0%
after the accident
um

00:08:17.749 --> 00:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and our team will do that
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
um it's important that as an industry
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
that somebody's watching out for bad
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
claims because of insurance fraud
 
00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:31.039 align:start position:0%
affects everybody else
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the integrity of the system requires
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
it and our team does a very good job at
 
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.110 align:start position:0%
it and our team does a very good job at
that

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
our department can and does hold
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement hearings when people violate
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
if we find that there is a intentional
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
violation of any of our insurance laws
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
we can hold a hearing
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have authority to
 
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.790 align:start position:0%
we have authority to
um

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.509 align:start position:0%
um
to

00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
assess fines for violations of up to
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred dollars per
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
violation uh depending on the uh the
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
extent of the violation and the
 
00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:01.590 align:start position:0%
extent of the violation and the
intention

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
intention
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh and then annually we hold a series of
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
public hearings including a workers comp
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
a workers compensation premium rate
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
hearing that's a hearing that we hold
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
each year to talk about the status of
 
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
workers comp
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
and the projected rates for the
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
following year
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
and also we hold a hearing on health
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
cost drivers so that the industry can
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
get together and talk about things that
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
are impacting our um
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
our health insurance costs
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things we do
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
at the department is
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
a consumer protection
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle and in a typical year our
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
department will have
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
just under 5 000
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh inquiries from consumers
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
and that could be anything it could be
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know what does actual cash value of
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
my policy mean or
 
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.990 align:start position:0%
my policy mean or
um

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
you know how do i get on to the exchange
 
00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:56.150 align:start position:0%
you know how do i get on to the exchange
to

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%

uh of those 5 000 or so inquiries 750 or
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
are consumer complaints uh they're
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
work with the consumers to determine
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
whether or not the there is a violation
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
of our insurance laws whether or not
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's a violation of our
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
settlement practices
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
or forms or notices

companies to mediate and settle
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
potential claims before they ever happen
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
last year we tracked
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
just over a million dollars in
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%

time any i'll give you all my um
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
personal cell phone which is
 
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.949 align:start position:0%
personal cell phone which is
six

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
zero three
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh nine one eight
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
zero three 5 9
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
if i can figure out how to
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
email that all in this
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
in this mechanism after i'm done talking
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
i'll do that as well
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you my office direct dial
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
as well that's two seven one
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.949 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
i'll skip over the
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
collection of taxes because norma's
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
gonna handle that in detail
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
the department will also um participate
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
in in all legislative uh proposals that
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
relate to the department and we do we
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
try to do that in a way uh which isn't
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
advocating for against a particular bill
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
because we are keenly aware that the
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
policy decision
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh that addresses insurance regulation
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
is uh is virtually always yours
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh as as as the house representatives
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
and uh but that doesn't mean we're not
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
going to come in and just make you aware
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
of either
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
the consequences
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
intended or unintended of your bill or
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
what that might do to the insurance
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
marketplace that we have
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
and so you'll see the department come in
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
and say we have no position on a bill
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
list off five or six concerns
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
we try to do that in a way that makes it
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
clear that we're not taking a policy
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
position on it sometimes it seems like
 
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.590 align:start position:0%
position on it sometimes it seems like
that

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
but we have experts here who have seen a
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
lot of these legislative proposals
 
00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.110 align:start position:0%
lot of these legislative proposals
before

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh we're happy to work with you on
 
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.310 align:start position:0%
uh we're happy to work with you on
legislative

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
initiatives that deal with insurance
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
ahead of time so that you're aware of
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
potential unintended consequences
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
but we're a resource to the legislature
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
um and i encourage you to use us right
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
if you have concerns with things related
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
to insurance
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
um i can assure you there is one of the
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
best experts in the state within this
 
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.190 align:start position:0%
best experts in the state within this
building

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
and then finally i just want to talk
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
i've already i've already mentioned how
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
insurance is a state-based regulation
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
and we do it here in new hampshire well
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
and other states
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
and districts do a great job
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean there aren't
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
issues that that that are the same
 
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
across the nation and
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a member of the
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
national association of insurance
 
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.670 align:start position:0%
national association of insurance
commissioners

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
which is a voluntary group of all of the
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
56 insurance commissioners where we work
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
together to ensure that we're not
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
recreating the wheel in each state
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
so naic
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with all of the
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
commissioners and their staff across the
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
nation will often have model legislation
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
targeted at issues that we're all
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
some of the naic
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
proposals ultimately become mandatory
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
because the naic
 
00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:26.389 align:start position:0%
because the naic
federal

00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
financial regulatory process is managed
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
across the nation so it's consistent and
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
so on occasion we'll come in with
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
a draft legislation from them that
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately will need to maintain our
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
financial accreditation
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
but most of the time they're just
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
providing us resources that
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
best understand issues that we'll be
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with here in new hampshire that
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
potentially could have national impact
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
this is the point where i typically turn
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
this over to norma but if there are
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions about the department or the
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
administration i'd be happy to answer
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
them now
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to have plenty of time
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
within this hour to get through norma's
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
as well so if you do have questions i'd
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to take them
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions at this point
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
in time
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
perfect norm i'm going to uh put it over
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
to you and i want to say thank you for
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
making those slides move as my
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay so okay i think i've got it now
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
everybody can hear me is that all right
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
good deal
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
all right there were no sources where
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
does the money come from
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
the premium tax makes up approximately
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
87 percent
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
of the general fund revenue
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
that the insurance department collects
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
the other 18
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
13 is collected from the fees and
 
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.790 align:start position:0%
13 is collected from the fees and
penalties

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%

the non-admitted market their tax rate
is

at three percent which that changed in
uh

00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
july 1st of 2010
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
there are approximately as of december
 
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.029 align:start position:0%
there are approximately as of december
31st

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
31st
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
316 producers that reported
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
premium written for the calendar year
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have producers that
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
once in january they realized that they
 
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.029 align:start position:0%
once in january they realized that they
had

00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
written policies with new hampshire
 
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.150 align:start position:0%

risks
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
they'll file so on occasion we do have
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
more producers that actually have to
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
file the annual premium tax form for
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
surplus lines which is
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
coming due it's
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
technically uh
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's due february first because i just
 
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.270 align:start position:0%
it's due february first because i just
realized

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
realized
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
january 31st is a sunday so it's
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
not a business day so therefore it's the
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
following day that
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
their tax is due
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
the independently procured tax is taxed
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
at three percent four percent excuse me
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
four percent and that's due on march
 
00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.070 align:start position:0%
four percent and that's due on march
first

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
of each year that they have a policy
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
in normal
 
00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:57.350 align:start position:0%
in normal
yes

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
could you explain
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%

they are
um

um
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
regulated and
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
they they fall under
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
different statutes uh the most recent
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%

non-admitted but as i said they are
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
there to provide

people in companies that need something
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
that the admitted market
 
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.149 align:start position:0%
that the admitted market
either

00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
does not want to
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh cover or cannot cover
 
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.390 align:start position:0%
uh cover or cannot cover
uh

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.430 align:start position:0%
uh
in

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
you'll find that
 
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.310 align:start position:0%
you'll find that
they're

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.029 align:start position:0%
they're
they

00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
good percentage of them have to go to
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh lloyd's
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
to purchase
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
the coverage
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
again they
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
the coverages that i say they they're
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
just either in a very unique profession
 
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.750 align:start position:0%
just either in a very unique profession
that

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.029 align:start position:0%
that
the

00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
admitted market
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
has not had a history or a trend so they
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
really how to price the policy
 
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.710 align:start position:0%
really how to price the policy
and

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
could you just give us an example of why
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
somebody would go to voids
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
because they can't buy the insurance
 
00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.950 align:start position:0%
because they can't buy the insurance
locally

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
locally
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
was an example
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
if they would do that
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
medical professions that they want a uh
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
higher risk policy than what's covered
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%

in
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
there are

ordinarily cover

the history of how

thank you that's good
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right all right now on the next
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
graph here we have
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
actually a ten-year of the uh revenue
 
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.390 align:start position:0%
actually a ten-year of the uh revenue
as

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
it came from the various
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh revenue sources
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
and just to
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
point out some of the
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh fluctuations here that
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
you see
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
between fiscal year
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
15 to 16 16.
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
we had an increase
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
and that was the first full year of the
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
managed care organizations administering
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire health protection
 
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.789 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire health protection
program

00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:24:56.799 --> 00:24:57.750 align:start position:0%
program
and

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
they had approximately
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
493 million dollars in
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
uh premium written
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:09.510 align:start position:0%
so that's
what

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
drove that amount up and
 
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.710 align:start position:0%
drove that amount up and
then

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal year 16 we had
 
00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:18.149 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal year 16 we had
the

00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:20.230 align:start position:0%
the
standard

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%

managed care organizations
 
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.590 align:start position:0%
managed care organizations
so

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
there again we in fiscal year 16
 
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.950 align:start position:0%
there again we in fiscal year 16
the

the

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.110 align:start position:0%

in fiscal year
 
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.549 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year
17

00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
17
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.789 align:start position:0%
there's a
decrease

00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.390 align:start position:0%
because the
aggregate

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
16 17 the
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
net aggregate pre taxable premium
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
increased four percent the actual
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
tax liability
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
was uh 1.2 million greater than than the
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
credit that was received now
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
there was also a
 
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.470 align:start position:0%
there was also a
increase

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
premium enterprise tax credit
 
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.830 align:start position:0%
premium enterprise tax credit
of

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
1.5 million
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
and what ends up happening with the the
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
credit is that
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
it actually
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
impacts that estimated prepayment they
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
make so
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
the impact to the revenue collected
 
00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:47.990 align:start position:0%
the impact to the revenue collected
is

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
doubled so it impacts at 3 million
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
instead of the
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
just the million five
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 18
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
that was the first year that
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
the insurance
 
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.029 align:start position:0%
the insurance
transferred

00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
premium tax of
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
11.7 million
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
for the health protection program fund
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
and then in fiscal year 19
 
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
the transfer was only
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
and now it's starting to level off
 
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.909 align:start position:0%
and now it's starting to level off
here

00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
what determines the amount of the
 
00:27:33.919 --> 00:27:35.909 align:start position:0%
what determines the amount of the
transfer

00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's based on the
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
premium tax that's collected
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion piece
 
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.190 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion piece
which

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
originally was
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
called the new hampshire protection
 
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.190 align:start position:0%
called the new hampshire protection
program

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
and now it's the
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
granite advantage
 
00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.830 align:start position:0%

health
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
program but it's for the the expansion
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
of medicaid
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
and it's the premium tax that's
 
00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.149 align:start position:0%
and it's the premium tax that's
collected

00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
collected
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.909 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
on the next chart here of the net
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
premium tax again so you see in fiscal
 
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.029 align:start position:0%
premium tax again so you see in fiscal
year

00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%

15

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
15
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
there is still an increase because
 
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.310 align:start position:0%
there is still an increase because
the

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
this chart
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
shows the
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
premium tax written
 
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.470 align:start position:0%
premium tax written
in

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
it includes that expansion piece so
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's why this chart doesn't show a
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
decrease because that
 
00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.110 align:start position:0%
decrease because that
transfer

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
i included
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
the premium written on on this chart so
 
00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:01.750 align:start position:0%
the premium written on on this chart so
the

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
actually the
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
health premium
 
00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:06.310 align:start position:0%
health premium
between

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
14 and 15 increased by
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
and then in
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.350 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
16

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
16
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.919 --> 00:29:36.549 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
this particular pie chart
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
shows the percentages
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
premium written
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
net taxable premium written
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.029 align:start position:0%
by the
various

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
various
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
types of companies that
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
in the pre type of premium
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's written
 
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
in 2019 is the most recent
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
calendar year we have we don't receive
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2020 until march uh first
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
they're required to
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
report uh and as you can see
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
primarily because of the
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
carriers that are now
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
administering the
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
medic aid
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
percentage

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.630 align:start position:0%
percentage
is

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
almost equal to the property and
 
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.750 align:start position:0%
almost equal to the property and
casualty

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
casualty
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
and remember the the health is taxed at
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
two percent
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
property and casualty
 
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
risk retention title in life are at
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is the non-admitted market and
 
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.310 align:start position:0%
this is the non-admitted market and
the

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
taxes that we collect
 
00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.269 align:start position:0%
taxes that we collect
from

00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
them have increased over the years
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh there
 
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.430 align:start position:0%
uh there
is

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
one particular year that we did have
 
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
a exception that
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh created the
 
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
increase here there was a
 
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.830 align:start position:0%
increase here there was a
single

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
single
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
policy sold on the non-admitted market
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
was that the tax was a million dollars
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
on that was a one-time policy and
 
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.110 align:start position:0%
on that was a one-time policy and
and

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
won't be
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
i anticipated not to
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
happen again so but as you can see the
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
market the non-admitted market is
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
growing and
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
she okay
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
the needs
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
of that that type of coverage is
 
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.190 align:start position:0%
of that that type of coverage is
increasing

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
now i just realized this morning that
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
this graft
 
00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.190 align:start position:0%
this graft
i'm

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
missing some zeros on the end here then
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
and it should be in actual numbers
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
saying millions over here but
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
basically this this is showing
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
what is reported on the comprehensive
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
annual financial report
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
that the department of administrative
 
00:32:19.679 --> 00:32:20.950 align:start position:0%
that the department of administrative
services

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
reproduces annually
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
as compared to what our plan was
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
and you can see that
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
been very fortunate in the last few
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
years to
 
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.430 align:start position:0%
years to
have

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.029 align:start position:0%
have
exceeded

00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
exceeded
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:48.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh what are the factors
 
00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:55.039 align:start position:0%
that impact the insurance companies
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
revenues we have
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
the taxable premium written which is the
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
basis obviously
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
changes in the
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
premium tax rates
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
retaliatory taxes
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
premium tax credits mended returns
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
the re domestication of
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
the licensed companies
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
and then like i say as far as the the
 
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.430 align:start position:0%
and then like i say as far as the the
volume

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
volume
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
of fees that we collect primarily from
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
the licensing of producers adjusters
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
in the various entities
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
as well as the penalties that are
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
retaliatory taxes maybe we want to just
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
discuss that briefly basically
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
what happens is that
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
insurance companies have a unique
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
taxation structure
 
00:33:55.679 --> 00:33:56.710 align:start position:0%
taxation structure
and

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.830 align:start position:0%
and
what

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.710 align:start position:0%
what
it

00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a tax rate of 1.25 on
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
property and casualty
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
now if a
 
00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:13.349 align:start position:0%
now if a
massachusetts

00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
company is licensed to do business in
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
and sells
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
property and casualty
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
they actually have to pay
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
2.28 percent premium tax to us
 
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.669 align:start position:0%
2.28 percent premium tax to us
because

00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire domestic
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
doing business in massachusetts
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
has to pay
 
00:34:35.919 --> 00:34:38.069 align:start position:0%
has to pay
2.28

00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
2.28
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
to massachusetts
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
the intent there is that
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
the companies
 
00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:47.109 align:start position:0%
the companies
are

00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
leveling off the
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
tax burden
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:34:52.879 --> 00:34:53.669 align:start position:0%
in this
should

00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
or hopefully should be a consideration
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
when a company may decide to
 
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.550 align:start position:0%
when a company may decide to
re-domesticate

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
re-domesticate
 
00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.430 align:start position:0%
re-domesticate
and

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the domestication
 
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.430 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the domestication
is

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
authority over those companies so at any
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
given point in time
 
00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.510 align:start position:0%
given point in time
a

a
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire company
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
could file paperwork
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
and request to be redomiciled to
 
00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:32.950 align:start position:0%
and request to be redomiciled to
massachusetts

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
they file paperwork with new hampshire
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
insurance department as well as
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and they have to get
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
permission to do this re-domestication
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know there there may be you know
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
their business model has changed so
 
00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.270 align:start position:0%
their business model has changed so
they're

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.069 align:start position:0%
they're
uh

00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
trying to consolidate some of their
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
businesses there are various reasons why
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
the companies would choose to
 
00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.630 align:start position:0%
the companies would choose to
redomesticate

00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
redomesticate
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
but the retaliatory provisions
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
are intended to
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate the
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
tax burden as being a factor
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
or a significant factor in that decision
 
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.990 align:start position:0%
or a significant factor in that decision
making

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
now the
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
insurance market how it operates is the
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
business cycle has two phases
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's a soft market
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
and then there's a hard market
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
these cycles don't
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily coincide with
 
00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:34.790 align:start position:0%
necessarily coincide with
the

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.829 align:start position:0%
the

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
during a soft market there's excess
 
00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.030 align:start position:0%
during a soft market there's excess
capacity

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
and the underwriting standards are low
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the price competitively high
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:51.990 align:start position:0%

in
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
they may actually stay relatively flat
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
now rates for property and casualty
 
00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.270 align:start position:0%
now rates for property and casualty
products

00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
may be very slow to increase or may even
 
00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:03.270 align:start position:0%
may be very slow to increase or may even
decrease

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
in a hard market
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
the capacity is a shortage in these
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
standards are more
 
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.390 align:start position:0%
standards are more
stringent

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
stringent
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
in the competition for price is weak and
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
premium will increase so basically it's
 
00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.190 align:start position:0%
premium will increase so basically it's
a

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
supply and demand
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
if the demand goes up
 
00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:26.470 align:start position:0%
if the demand goes up
then

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.270 align:start position:0%
then
the

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
capacity has to
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
shortage will create a shortage because
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
the demand
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
and the current information that i have
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
from our actuaries on the property and
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
casualty market
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:51.829 align:start position:0%
is that
the

00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
different markets
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
can flow through this cycle at different
 
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.950 align:start position:0%
can flow through this cycle at different
rates

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
different lines of business
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
will have different demands the
 
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
commercial versus the personal
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
commercial tends to be more volatile
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
than personal
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
because of the regulations
 
00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.430 align:start position:0%
because of the regulations
that

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
take all comers in new hampshire
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
since the great depression it was very
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to describe the position of
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
many insurance markets in the cycle
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
because of the economic recovery
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
although steady it's been very slow
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
tort reform and claim mitigations that
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
have also played a role in limiting the
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
volatility of commercial markets
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
so for example the medical professional
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
liability market in new hampshire has
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
been a soft market for many years
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
and that having finally been
 
00:38:49.359 --> 00:38:50.710 align:start position:0%
and that having finally been
hardening

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
hardening
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
well the workers comp market
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
looks to remain soft for at least the
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
near term
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
the effects on all markets of the kova
 
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.310 align:start position:0%
the effects on all markets of the kova
pandemic

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
remain to be seen but very early
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
indications suggest personal line
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
carriers retain more than enough capital
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
to delay or eliminate any customary rate
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
increases well commercial carriers are
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
revising rules to tighten language
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
around communicable disease
 
00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.630 align:start position:0%
around communicable disease
exclusions

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
exclusions
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.870 align:start position:0%
so
the

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
projections that we have are derived
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
from a blend of two methodologies
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
one the new hampshire insurance
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
department actuaries who receive the
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
company rate filings are in a position
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
to monitor any of the developments
 
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
in requested rate
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
making changes that will ultimately
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
become part of the premium charge for
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
the various lines of business
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
in addition they factor in current
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
general economic trends
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
that will ultimately affect the amount
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the premium tax
 
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.710 align:start position:0%
of the premium tax
the

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.990 align:start position:0%
the
other

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
part two of that process is that the
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
insurance tax division
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
reviews annual statement information
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
the revenue trends from an accounting
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
and historic perspective
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
projections are developed for the
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
majority the major products categories
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
are based on trend analysis
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
and then the two methodologies are
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
merged together
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
so for calendar year fiscal year
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
2021 that we're currently in
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
we had originally
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
projected the
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
130.9 million dollars
 
00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:05.510 align:start position:0%
130.9 million dollars
in

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
128.2 million
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.190 align:start position:0%
some of the
uh

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursements or
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
refunds that were going on
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic in the
 
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.630 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic in the

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
auto
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
market and then also
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
just the
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
general anticipated decrease in people
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
buying or renewing or businesses
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
renewing their policies
 
00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:38.710 align:start position:0%
renewing their policies
so

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
at currently
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.630 align:start position:0%
we actually
are

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
saying that uh
 
00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.910 align:start position:0%
saying that uh
are

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're about 2 million as of december
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
31st 2020
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
the revenue focus
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
a report that the department of
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
administrative services producers showed
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
that we are ahead
 
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.069 align:start position:0%
that we are ahead
by

00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
2 million
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year but
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
that is primarily the licensing of
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
producers because
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
we obviously the
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
premium taxes
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
are due in march and that is where we're
 
00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:22.790 align:start position:0%
are due in march and that is where we're
getting

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.990 align:start position:0%
getting
the

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.349 align:start position:0%
the
87

00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
87
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
of our revenues so at this
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
time i'm still comfortable with a little
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
bit less
 
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.109 align:start position:0%
bit less
anticipated

00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
revenue than what we had originally
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
so for fiscal year 2020
 
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
two in 2023
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
these are the projections that we
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
currently have as part of the agency's
 
00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.990 align:start position:0%
currently have as part of the agency's
submission

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
submission
 
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.670 align:start position:0%
submission
and

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.750 align:start position:0%
and
again

00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
2022 is reflecting
 
00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.190 align:start position:0%
2022 is reflecting
a

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know continuation of the
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
decrease in the
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
the amount of
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
coverages and purchases
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
that are made
 
00:43:14.319 --> 00:43:15.670 align:start position:0%
that are made
in

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
you know the transfer you know
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
generally it's the unknown impact of
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
what the kova pandemic is going to have
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
on people purchasing
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
their policies how it's going to affect
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
but we're anticipating in fiscal year
 
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.829 align:start position:0%
but we're anticipating in fiscal year
2023

00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:43:37.839 --> 00:43:39.190 align:start position:0%
2023
that

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
it will
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
be a recovery and the other thing that's
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
going to obviously impact is how much
 
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.230 align:start position:0%
going to obviously impact is how much
federal

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
support is given to
 
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.069 align:start position:0%
support is given to
the

00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
states as well as the individuals
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
to help them
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
get back on
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
their feet on
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
the businesses as well as the
 
00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:04.710 align:start position:0%
the businesses as well as the
individuals

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
and last but not least
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
on this slide is the information for
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
contacting anyone in the insurance
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
department the general phone number or
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
fax machine
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
the consumer hotline is there
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh in i believe that
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
they're available at all hours or at
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
least they have a number that you can
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
leave information we also have a number
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
of email addresses here that
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
anyone can send
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
a email to or
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
a general request for information
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
so at any point in time
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're here to answer any questions and
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
help and assist in any way that we
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
excellent presentation
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
the insurance department along with
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
presentation relative to their revenue
 
00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:09.349 align:start position:0%
presentation relative to their revenue
and

00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
deviate much from the numbers because
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
they've provided so much information
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
and clarity
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
the only thing is i hope that with the
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
covered 19 that things don't
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
get upset too much
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
and yes i'm muted
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
i had two
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
questions which are generally around the
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
same kind of thing there are some things
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
you said today that i hadn't heard
 
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.750 align:start position:0%
you said today that i hadn't heard
before

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
and the first one was
 
00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.829 align:start position:0%
and the first one was
on

00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
the side you just showed showed the
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
problem that we have with a prepayment
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
on every year of the next year's funding
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
which means that we don't know what the
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
past one is which means that if
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
the past one was
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
higher than what we're going to get this
 
00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.750 align:start position:0%
higher than what we're going to get this
time

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.710 align:start position:0%
time
on

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
we lose double and if it's lower we gain
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
double which aggravates the cycles on
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
but you were saying something about this
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
being due to a
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
on to doubling the bet credit
 
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.030 align:start position:0%
on to doubling the bet credit
change

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
and that confused me and then the other
 
00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.109 align:start position:0%
and that confused me and then the other
one

00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
well maybe maybe i could ask the other
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
one after you answer
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay on any credits whether it's the
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
or the there is another credit that's
 
00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:49.589 align:start position:0%
or the there is another credit that's
allowed

00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
for the life accident health guaranteed
 
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.750 align:start position:0%
for the life accident health guaranteed
fund

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.790 align:start position:0%
fund
but

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
they're a dollar for dollar impact
 
00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.790 align:start position:0%
they're a dollar for dollar impact
to

00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.710 align:start position:0%
to
the

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
tax liability
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
so if the tax liability
 
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.829 align:start position:0%
so if the tax liability
decreases

00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
decreases
 
00:47:07.839 --> 00:47:08.710 align:start position:0%
decreases
by

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
the million five
 
00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.309 align:start position:0%
the million five
then

00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:13.430 align:start position:0%
then
the

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
estimated prepayment
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
for the following year
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
which is based off of the tax liability
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
there's the relationship because that
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
that estimated
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
prepayment is based off of that tax
 
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.190 align:start position:0%
prepayment is based off of that tax
liability

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
that the estimated prepayment will also
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so this also affects the
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
amount of bt that we're getting
 
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.550 align:start position:0%
amount of bt that we're getting
yes

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:53.430 align:start position:0%
yes
so

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
some way you could estimate that too
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
so we've got it clear we
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
we actually have legislation in this
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
year so that i can
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
receive information
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
we can enter into a memorandum of
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
understanding with the department of
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
revenue so that they can provide us with
 
00:48:16.319 --> 00:48:18.309 align:start position:0%
revenue so that they can provide us with
the

00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax that the
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
insurance companies have paid to them so
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
i will have that information a year
 
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.470 align:start position:0%
i will have that information a year
before

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
i currently
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
receive it
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
so i currently receive it when the tax
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
payments and tax reports are filed with
 
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.030 align:start position:0%
payments and tax reports are filed with
us

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
with the legislation i'll be able to get
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
that information a year in advance
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
hey thank you so
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
the d.r.a it's already been been being
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
incorporated in their estimates but it'd
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
be nice to know from our side the other
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
one is on you you mentioned that risk
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
retention and life is at 1.25
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
along with property and casualty i
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
always we we only changed property and
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
casualty when did we change risk
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
retention in life
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
well risk retention groups
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
sell property and casualty
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
the life was included the way that the
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
law was written it was
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
only the
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
accident in health the medical
 
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:25.990 align:start position:0%
accident in health the medical
that

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
remained at two percent
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay we've been fighting
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
for ten years we have others lined up to
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
ask questions and so just limit your
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
questions to two
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
so everybody gets an opportunity to ask
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative brandy
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh norah um real quick so the
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
hhs transfer was that all part of the
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
negotiation that happened to get uh
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
medicaid expansion passed
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
as part of the ten percent that the
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
state has to pick up versus the ninety
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
percent that the feds are picking up
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh i remember that hospitals and and
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
insurance companies kind of said yeah
 
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:08.870 align:start position:0%
insurance companies kind of said yeah
well

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll we'll basically pick up the
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
tab for the ten percent to get to ninety
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
percent is that correct
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes that that was part of the
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
when the federal
 
00:50:22.559 --> 00:50:24.150 align:start position:0%
when the federal
uh

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
portion started to decrease below the
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
right right thank you and the second
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
is another example of a non-admitted
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
would that be someone like is a
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
professional piano player that wants to
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
insure his his fingers let's say and uh
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
other companies wouldn't touch it is
 
00:50:42.559 --> 00:50:43.349 align:start position:0%
other companies wouldn't touch it is
that

00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
is that an example
 
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.670 align:start position:0%
is that an example
yes

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
yes yes anything unique
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
so my question is about the
 
00:50:59.599 --> 00:51:03.109 align:start position:0%
so my question is about the
transfer

00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's related to the granite advantage
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
health trust fund
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what kind of risk
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
there is that the transfer would would
 
00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:13.349 align:start position:0%
there is that the transfer would would
be

00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:14.309 align:start position:0%
be
uh

00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
significantly greater than
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
what you have here for fiscal year 2022
 
00:51:20.079 --> 00:51:20.829 align:start position:0%
what you have here for fiscal year 2022
and

00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
something you can predict
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
if if the
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
transfer amount increases that would
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
only be reflecting because the premium
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
tax collected increased
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
so any increase to that
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
estimated amount
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
would mean that we collected more
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
premium tax
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
from that particular expansion
 
00:51:53.359 --> 00:51:55.589 align:start position:0%
from that particular expansion
premium

00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
premium
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
good so that's a wash
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm looking at the revenue
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
estimates uh here and it says that
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
you're down by
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
0.2 is that because of the prepayment is
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
that or is what i
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
maybe i missed that
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
in your presentation if so i apologize
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
but i'm trying just to figure out this
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
relatively steady every year and it has
 
00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:33.190 align:start position:0%
relatively steady every year and it has
been

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.750 align:start position:0%
been
um

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
are you is this in fiscal year 2021 that
 
00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.069 align:start position:0%
are you is this in fiscal year 2021 that
you're

00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:52:40.079 --> 00:52:41.030 align:start position:0%
you're
questioning

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
questioning
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
yes well again when we met with the
 
00:52:43.839 --> 00:52:45.589 align:start position:0%
yes well again when we met with the
actuaries

00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
actuaries
 
00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:47.430 align:start position:0%
actuaries
to

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.950 align:start position:0%
to
update

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
update
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
the information
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
they were considering
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
what the impact of
 
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:55.990 align:start position:0%
what the impact of
the

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
refunds for the auto in
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
the unemployment
 
00:53:01.119 --> 00:53:02.069 align:start position:0%
the unemployment
in

00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
what all it
 
00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:04.390 align:start position:0%
what all it
the

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
what was happening that kova 19 had
 
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.470 align:start position:0%
what was happening that kova 19 had
impacted

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
the people that uh in companies
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
so it was felt that
 
00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.390 align:start position:0%
so it was felt that
the

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
pr the premium tax would be less
 
00:53:24.079 --> 00:53:24.950 align:start position:0%
pr the premium tax would be less
in

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.829 align:start position:0%
in
again

00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's really not a lot of the
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
premium tax amount but
 
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.829 align:start position:0%
premium tax amount but
again

00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:53:31.839 --> 00:53:33.829 align:start position:0%
again
because

00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
even if you anticipate that the
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
premium tax collected is going to tax
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
liability will be decreased by a million
 
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.790 align:start position:0%
liability will be decreased by a million
dollars

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
it also decreases that
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
prepayment for the following year by a
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars resulting in
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying i i i
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
i didn't quite get that correctly in you
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
in your presentation thank you very much
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.470 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
representative

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you norma for the presentation i
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
just have another clarification on that
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
same slide
 
00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:17.150 align:start position:0%
same slide
um

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
130.9 million budgeted
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
128.2 million projected and you i
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
believe you made the statement that you
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
said you were comfortable
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
with that does that mean you're
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the projection of 128.2
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
million or the fact that
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
if it ends up being 128.2 million
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
i believe that that will be
 
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
the amount
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
that we actually collect
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
the fees have been
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
increasing and as i stated as of
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
december that we are ahead by two
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
million in the fees
 
00:55:03.599 --> 00:55:05.829 align:start position:0%
million in the fees
uh

00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:05.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
premium tax information
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
we really don't get
 
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.470 align:start position:0%
we really don't get
the

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.230 align:start position:0%
the
sufficient

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
detailed information prior to march 1st
 
00:55:18.319 --> 00:55:19.670 align:start position:0%
detailed information prior to march 1st
so

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
i'm relying on what the actuaries
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
are telling me that you know
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
due to the
 
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.030 align:start position:0%
due to the
uh

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
impact of kova 19 that
 
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.790 align:start position:0%
impact of kova 19 that
the

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
premium tax would be less than what we
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
i do have another question and that is
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
on the premium tax uh how do we stand
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
normal compared to other states are we
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the middle
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
i'm really not sure i don't have that
 
00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:02.630 align:start position:0%
i'm really not sure i don't have that
comparison

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
available but
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
the rate
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
we can get that for you uh chairman
 
00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:07.910 align:start position:0%
we can get that for you uh chairman
major

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay then the final question is
 
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
the retaliatory tax
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
how big how much of a percentage is that
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
well it's broken down between the
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
retaliatory on the premium tax
 
00:56:29.359 --> 00:56:31.030 align:start position:0%
retaliatory on the premium tax
amount

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:56:33.119 --> 00:56:34.309 align:start position:0%
in the
premium

00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
premium
 
00:56:34.319 --> 00:56:35.589 align:start position:0%
premium
the

00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:35.599 --> 00:56:36.870 align:start position:0%
the
assessments

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
that other states have so
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
there are a number of different
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
assessments that massachusetts charges
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire companies so
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
i have approximately
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
eight million that's collected
 
00:56:53.359 --> 00:56:54.150 align:start position:0%
eight million that's collected
from

00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.109 align:start position:0%
from
the

00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
retaliatory on the various assessments
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
and fees that other states charge
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
on the premium tax rate itself
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a fair
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
fair amount
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's about 10 of the
 
00:57:17.359 --> 00:57:18.710 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's about 10 of the
okay

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
well again want to thank you for

director of the road toll
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
morning mr chair members of the
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%

00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.910 align:start position:0%

yes

00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
very good uh my name is steve lavoy i'm
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
the director of administration for the
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
with me today is scott breyer who is our
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
bureau chief of the road toll bureau and
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
we'll be presenting today
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
on the revenues that we collect here at
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
safety the vast majority of our revenue
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
collections have to do with the highway
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
fund we do also collect some general
 
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
fund revenues and those general fund
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
revenues are recorded in the other
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
general fund category so it's a small
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
portion of the very small portion of the
 
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
general fund so we'll spend a little bit
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
of time at the end um going over those
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
but the vast majority of our discussion
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
will be on highway fund and revenues and
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing um to hopefully
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
provide you with the information you
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
need to develop your estimates for for
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
the next budget okay and you're going to
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
be able to share your screen with us
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
all right are you seeing that yep
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
division of motor vehicles are the two
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
areas where we collect highway fund
 
00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.470 align:start position:0%
areas where we collect highway fund
revenues

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
some of our general fund revenues are
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
also collected through state state
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
overview of our revenue collections
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
we have significant highway fund
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
revenues usually 248 million in
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
unrestricted gross revenues as i
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned motor vehicles and admin
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
collect most of those and we'll go
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
through estimates as well as some
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
history on
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
the specific revenue sources including
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
road toll and the different motor
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle classifications and then for
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
highway fund as i mentioned we have a
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
small portion of uh that falls under the
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
other category only about nine million
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
um and those are collected in some some
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
key categories and we'll talk about each
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
of those that includes initial plate
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
fees penalty assessments
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
pistol permits and then some licensing
 
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.349 align:start position:0%
pistol permits and then some licensing
fees

01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
to start we'll take a look at highway
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
fund revenues
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
each one of our slides as we work
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
through the presentation will be set out
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
in a very similar way um so we're going
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
to show the actual um
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
historical collections from 16 through
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
20 and then our projections are 20 for
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
21 22 and 23.
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
so this is the entire highway fund
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
revenue collection unrestricted gross
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
only um as a whole so this includes both
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
road toll as well as motor vehicle
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
revenue collections
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
and as you'll see um
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
from 16 to 20 uh we really are let's
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
pause and 20 from 16 to 19 there's been
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
a very slight increase each year usually
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
about one percent um
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
the the highway fund is uh a fund that
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
supports both the department of
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
transportation uh and also portions of
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
the department of safety uh including
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
state police
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
and um the rate of growth within with
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
revenues in the highway fund has not
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
um has not been able to fully support
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
the rate of growth and expenditures in
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
both of those areas so there's been
 
01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
pressure on the fund as a whole for for
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
many years now um even a one percent
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
growth in the fund is not going to
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
support a two or three percent growth in
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
expenditures um which is a very modest
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
growth for for those operations but you
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
can see we did have growth from 16
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
through 19.
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
in fy 20 there was a decline uh due to
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
covid um we lost uh 10.8 million dollars
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
off of plant which is about 4.2 percent
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
less than we expected
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh if you recall hope started in march
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
so we really um we really had a strong
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
beginning year and so our our losses
 
01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.470 align:start position:0%
beginning year and so our our losses
weren't

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
weren't
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
as as big as they will be in 21 um
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
because in fy 21 we're experiencing
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
covet impacts throughout the whole year
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
so in 21
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
for the entire highway fund we're
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
looking to be 6.9 under plan which is a
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
for covet 19 impacts which will go into
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
more detail on each revenue source
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
road toll is really the main source that
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
was significantly impacted
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
as you'll see when we get to the motor
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle revenues
 
01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:12.950 align:start position:0%
vehicle revenues
most

01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
are in reasonably good shape there were
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
some small
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
reductions that we experienced but
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
overall motor vehicle revenues have been
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
stable it's road toll revenues based on
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
traffic volumes that um gasoline
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
consumption that have taken the hit
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
so at this point what i'm going to do is
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
i'm going to turn it over to scott
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
the road toll bureau administrator to
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
talk in detail about the road toll um
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
for those of you many of you know scott
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
already for those of you who might be
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
new to the committee
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
scott has been our our subject matter
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
expert on fuel tax in the state of new
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire for the last 20 years he's
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
been in his role for over 20 years now
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
and he's actually serving his second
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
term as the president of the
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
international fuel tax agreement
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
which which is a
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
fuel tax agreement that we have with
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
other states that we're a member of um
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
so he represents new hampshire um in a
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
very strong high role in that in that
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
national actually international group so
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
scott i'll turn it over to you now
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.039 --> 01:04:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.190 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
so road toll operations uh the road toll
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
is primarily statutory responsible for
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
collecting motor fuel taxes uh as most
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
people on the committee uh refer to as
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
the gas tax
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
in enforcing compliance with the motor
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle road toll law to its field audit
 
01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.190 align:start position:0%
vehicle road toll law to its field audit
bureau

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
the road toll is not related to toll
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
booths on the turnpike system which is
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
operated by the department of
 
01:04:46.079 --> 01:04:48.150 align:start position:0%
operated by the department of
transportation

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh the road toll bureau administers
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 180 motor fuel distributor
 
01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.750 align:start position:0%
approximately 180 motor fuel distributor
licenses

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
1787 international fuel tax agreement
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
licenses and about 1900
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
international registration plan
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
registrants and there's approximately
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
200 uh 240
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh oil discharge pollution control
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
licenses this is uh these are the
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
licenses we collect our revenue on
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
behalf of the uh
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
the oil fund displacement board
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
this slide just kind of uh some of you
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
seen this before this is roll told this
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
is kind of show you where the point of
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
taxation is
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire uses a distributed tax
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh model for motor fuel tax uh basically
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh fuel comes into the state to barge or
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
tank funds from
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
either transportation to trucks or barge
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
comes into a terminal facility
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
um and then it's delivered by truckload
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
um the point of taxation is when the
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
product gets dropped into the retail
 
01:06:01.119 --> 01:06:02.309 align:start position:0%
product gets dropped into the retail
station

01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
station
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
prior to that uh no taxes are paid in
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
until it's put into the station so the
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
next slide please
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
so fact is impacting the estimates
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh changes in behavior to sponsor the
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
coven 19 pandemic caused energy demand
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
and supply claims in
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
the 2020.
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
the impact in future years remains
 
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.349 align:start position:0%
the impact in future years remains
uncertain

01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
uncertain
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about price according to
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
triple a the average price per gallon in
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is about two dollars and
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
33 cents
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
this is down about
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
approximately 15 15 cents from last
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
year's average of two 2.48 cents per
 
01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.630 align:start position:0%
year's average of two 2.48 cents per
gallon

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
gallon
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
prices have increased by about 17 and a
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
half cents
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
since december of 20 uh since this past
 
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.349 align:start position:0%
since december of 20 uh since this past
december

01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
december
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
so the us energy
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
information administration forecast
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
motor gasoline prices to average about
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
240 a gallon in 2021 and 242 a gallon in
 
01:07:08.079 --> 01:07:09.910 align:start position:0%
240 a gallon in 2021 and 242 a gallon in
2022

01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh crude oil prices are average 53
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
dollars a barrel in both uh 2021 and
 
01:07:16.319 --> 01:07:17.750 align:start position:0%
dollars a barrel in both uh 2021 and
2022.

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
i'm going to talk a little bit how
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
weather affects realtor
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
dry summers and snowy winters help drive
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
tourism in new hampshire and result in
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
increased fuel consumption however with
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
the coven 19 restrictions lack of snow
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
and capacity limitations that the skiers
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
are putting a downward pressure on fuel
 
01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.150 align:start position:0%
are putting a downward pressure on fuel
consumption

01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
and then with the economy the real gross
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
domestic product
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
increased that annual rate of 33.4 in
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
the third quarter of 2020 in the second
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
quarter 20 the real
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
gross domestic product decreased by
 
01:07:50.039 --> 01:07:51.589 align:start position:0%
gross domestic product decreased by
31.4

01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
31.4
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
companies may lock in cost savings
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
associated with remote working and
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
making these arrangements permanent
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
which if more people remote working
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
results in less community miles
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
and that will impact world totals
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
next slide steve
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
so this is kind of give you a picture of
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh unrestricted road toll revving
 
01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.269 align:start position:0%
uh unrestricted road toll revving
so

01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
right now uh the gap price per gallon
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
for road toll fee is 22.2 cents a gallon
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
so fiscal year 20 we collected about
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
just shy of 120 million dollars in
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
revenues which was about 10.3 million
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
less than the 130 million that we
 
01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:36.950 align:start position:0%
less than the 130 million that we
projected

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
projected
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 we were projected to
 
01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.510 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 we were projected to
collect

01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
collect
 
01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:44.450 align:start position:0%
114.4 million in revenues which is 17.9
 
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:45.829 align:start position:0%
114.4 million in revenues which is 17.9
[Music]

01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
or 13.5 percent less than the plan of
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
132.3 million
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2223 projections assume that
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
full recovery in a pulse covered
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
environment will be around seven percent
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the pre-colbin levels during due to
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
the permanent reductions in commuting
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
that we anticipate from work at home
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
people that are not working at home
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
next slide please
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
this is just kind of a give a
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
kind of graph that shows what happened
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
uh during this past year because of
 
01:09:17.839 --> 01:09:19.110 align:start position:0%
uh during this past year because of
colby

01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
colby
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh original estimates uh some monthly
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
revenues would plateau at about five
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
percent of pre-covered collections and
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
the decline recovery rates over the last
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
several months have led us to revise our
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh expected plateau rate down to eight
 
01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.470 align:start position:0%
uh expected plateau rate down to eight
percent

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 the estimated world
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
poll revenue of 120 million assumes an
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
eight percent decline from pre-covered
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal 19 amounts in our fiscal year 23
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
estimated world total revenue of 121
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
million assumes a seven percent decline
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
from pre-colbin fiscal year 19 amounts
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.640 --> 01:09:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
so these uh i'm gonna turn the
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
presentation back over to steve but
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
before i do that is there any questions
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
a good scot good presentation so far
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
guys uh st uh scott
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
um how about the uh now this is
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
something near to uh uh representative
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
major's heart
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh the the continuing pressure of
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
efficient cars on the road is that been
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
factored in at all uh yes we always
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
factor that in um so as you know
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
as fuel might as the cars become more
 
01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.030 align:start position:0%
as fuel might as the cars become more
efficient

01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh and as people are switching over to
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
electric and other types of uh
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
alternative fuels that will have an
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
impact on road toll and that was uh that
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
was taken into consideration we were
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
coming up with these estimates okay
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
you can go ahead there doesn't seem to
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
be any other questions
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
great thanks scott um and just for the
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
committee's benefit too um
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
you know scott and his team have done a
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
great job during copenhagen uh they have
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
they really modernized the tax
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
collection process prior to this years
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
ago um allowing for online collections
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
and even when we were forced to close
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
our offices for in-person um
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
appointments they were able to shift the
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
the little bit of collection that they
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
needed to do that's not online they were
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
able to shift that to a drop-off and
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
mail collection service and help people
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
over the phone uh so um all of the
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
reductions that you're seeing are
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
directly related to less vehicles on the
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
road less fuel being consumed um in in
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
no way does this represent any changes
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
in operations so scott and his team did
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
a great job keeping things moving during
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh during the uncertain times of covet
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
and again the the big piece
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
for the committee to consider is really
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
in 22 and 23
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
where that plateau mark will be we
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
believe it's going to be around the
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
eight or seven percent range um
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
it's it all depends upon um how much
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
volume on the roads we can expect to
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
recover to pre-covered levels and so
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
that that's the big unknown that's going
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
to be a challenge to project
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
unlike road toll which is based on
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
gallon consumption
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
dmv has been mostly insulated from from
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
the kobit 19 impacts
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
and there's there's a main reason why
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
one we've got uh minimal public
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
transportation options in new hampshire
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're a rural state and you really need
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
to have a vehicle to go about your
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
business to go to the grocery store
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
obtain goods and services um you don't
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
have other options like a major
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
you're still going to need a driver
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
license to operate your vehicle
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
the tv did not waive any requirements
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic period they did
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
extend driver license renewals for a
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
six-month period but that extension
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
required you to reach out to the dmv and
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
actually collect the revenue at that
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
point in time um
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
it just if you needed to come in in
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
person for the eye exam or to get the
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
picture taken you could do that six
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
months later but there was no change in
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
revenue uh if they had made that change
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
we would have shifted revenue into
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
different periods um so because of that
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
they were able to to keep the operator
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
which is the driver licensing revenue
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
relatively stable um
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
and throughout the uh
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic um
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
one of the other benefits uh director
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
bilecki worked hard with her team to
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
make sure the dmv could stay open so
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the dmv closed for two
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
days in march
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
and those two days were to change their
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
business model from in-person um
 
01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:17.669 align:start position:0%
business model from in-person um
drop-in

01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
drop-in
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
appointments to
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
scheduled appointments and other states
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
including maine and vermont
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
they were closed for months and so the
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
entire dmv service was closed which
 
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
meant there was no revenue generation in
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we closed for two days
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
shifted the business model and were able
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
to continue to collect revenue because
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
of it so hats off to director bilecki
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
and her team for for making those
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
changes and really keeping us at a good
 
01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.470 align:start position:0%
changes and really keeping us at a good
spot

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
spot
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
um other factors impacting dmv fees um
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
we've seen vehicle sales
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
be impacted but they've really been
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
stronger than we've expected um
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
they've there's been a little bit of a
 
01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.630 align:start position:0%
they've there's been a little bit of a
decline

01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
decline
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit of softness in vehicle
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
sales but
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
nothing as bad as we expected uh heading
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
into the pandemic
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
existing vehicles continue to be
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%
inspected and registered so again those
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
requirements were not waived um
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
and some downward pressure on
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
registration and inspection but nothing
 
01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.830 align:start position:0%
registration and inspection but nothing
significant

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.709 align:start position:0%
significant
um

01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
one area that we did see reductions had
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
to do with traffic violations
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
so in plea by mail revenue
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
and also um court fines so those that
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
that went to court and and were paid we
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
saw reductions because there were left
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals on the road and less
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
violations that therefore being issued
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
so that is an area that we saw some
 
01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.430 align:start position:0%
so that is an area that we saw some
reduction

01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
um and again changing the business model
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
was really key to to leveling off the
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
impact of covet dmv and so online
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
pop-off services allowed us to provide
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
service to the to the people of new
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire and continue to collect the
 
01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.830 align:start position:0%
hampshire and continue to collect the
revenues

01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
so motor vehicle registration revenue is
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
what we'll look at first
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
in fy 20
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
we collected 87.7 million which was
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
actually 2.6 million more than plan um
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
again if you remember fy20 only a
 
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
portion of that year had it was impacted
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
by um by the pandemic so we had a strong
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
first pass
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
which is why we did still see an
 
01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.590 align:start position:0%
which is why we did still see an
increase

01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh in fy 21 we're projecting to collect
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
26.2 million in revenues which is about
 
01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
one percent or 1.1 million more than
 
01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.510 align:start position:0%
one percent or 1.1 million more than
plan

01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
um we still are seeing our our plan
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
numbers were were very conservative and
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
we're still seeing some some additional
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
increases not much
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
but some
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
so for now registration revenues appears
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
relatively strong
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know we're assuming a five percent
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
decrease because of cobit through the
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
rest of this year
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
and then we're assuming relatively flat
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
um into 22 and 23 just due to the
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
economic uncertainty of what's going to
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
happen in the next several years you
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
could take one approach and say we're
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
assuming everyone vaccinated and
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
overturned to normal
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the early fall
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
or um but we don't know that's for
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
certain and if variants are not
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
responding to the vaccine there might be
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
additional concerns so we felt a
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
conservative approach was the best
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle operator revenue
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
this is driver licenses
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
so driver licenses you'll see right off
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
the bat
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
fy 16 only 7.1 million fy 17 13 million
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
that change is due to a change in um in
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
law that creates a dip year where the
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
license renewal process
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
changed from four years to five years so
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
every five years we have a reduction in
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
um in licensing this is planned and
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.350 align:start position:0%
um in licensing this is planned and
expected

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
expected
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that reduction was planned
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
for in fy 21. so we essentially get a
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
double hit in fy 21 one due to covid and
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
the other due to
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
just a planned reduction in operator
 
01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.030 align:start position:0%
just a planned reduction in operator
revenues

01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
so in fy 20 we collected 12.6 million
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
dollars which was about 726 000 less
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
than plan
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
and in 21 we're projecting to collect
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
8.8 million dollars which is about 300
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
000 more than plan
 
01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:25.510 align:start position:0%
000 more than plan
um

01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
our projections are assuming a 40
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
decrease from the pre-covered levels of
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
the prior year which that 40 is
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
accounting for that dip year component
 
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
um and then based off of the dip year uh
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
and what we're seeing
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's about 23
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
increase each dip year so every five
 
01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:47.110 align:start position:0%
increase each dip year so every five
years

01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
the um we gained 23 thereabouts so
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
we're assuming then assuming that rate
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
is steady and continues
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
the dip year would resolve itself and
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
officially flatten
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
after 20 35 but until that point we have
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
to account for this every once in a
 
01:19:03.679 --> 01:19:04.630 align:start position:0%
to account for this every once in a
while

01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
so as we move forward and we move out of
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
the dip year we really expect revenues
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
to return uh for driver license
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
operators to return to pre-covered
 
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.470 align:start position:0%
operators to return to pre-covered
levels

01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
levels
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
because again the reasons we talked at
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
the beginning people need a license
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
they're required by law to have a
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
license to operate a motor vehicle in
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll be coming forward for
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
their renewals as planned no real
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
concerns here
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle title revenue um again
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
this is an area that that really hasn't
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
has been somewhat insulated by covid19
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
in fy 20 we collected 9.5 million
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
dollars in revenues which is about 1.7
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
or 169 000 less than our plan
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
and in 21 we're projecting to collect
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
9.6 million which is about 200 000 or 2
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
percent less than plan
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
our remaining projections assume a 10
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
decrease through april and then a 5
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
increase in may and june
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
again assuming the economic recovery
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
does start to
 
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
show signs of of of more vehicle
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
transactions um and our our 22 and 23
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
projections really return us to our
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
pre-covet levels um looking at the
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
history from 16 to 19. um you know we
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
felt confident that uh we'll be
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere between the fy 18 and fy 19
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
revenue collection assuming that things
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle inspection revenue
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
this is a smaller area so we collect
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
about four million dollars here each
 
01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.590 align:start position:0%
about four million dollars here each
year

01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
you can see in fy 20 we collected 4
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
million which was about 288 000 or 7.7
 
01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
percent more than plan
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
in 21 we're projecting to collect 3.9
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
million and which is 300 000 uh more
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
than planned
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
um the inspection revenue this is the
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
fees collected from getting your motor
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspected it's three dollars and
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
25 cents for each each inspection
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
sticker uh there's also a two-year
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
station fee um inspection station fee
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
and those fees are are
 
01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
represented in the um
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
in the dips that you can see each year
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
so you've got the peaks and valleys and
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's because of the two-year
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
inspection station uh revenue that comes
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
in so moving forward we expect this to
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
continue this revenue source to continue
 
01:21:36.630 --> 01:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
this next slide
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
these are the what are known as the
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous fees for motor vehicles so
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
these fall under the miscellaneous
 
01:21:43.679 --> 01:21:45.110 align:start position:0%
these fall under the miscellaneous
category

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
category
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
on on the revenue focus
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
so i've tried to color code these to
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
give you some uh some idea of what these
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
are so we'll start with the orange the
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
orange are the motor vehicle fines that
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
are collected by the judicial branch so
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
if you get a driver a violation and you
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
contest it
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
you do so in court and if the courts
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
reduce your fine or require you to pay
 
01:22:08.719 --> 01:22:09.510 align:start position:0%
reduce your fine or require you to pay
it

01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
that's what these these amounts
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
represent so you can see there's been um
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's been a bit of a decline in these
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
revenues for some time
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
part of the decline in the past
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
have been changes to the uniform fine
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
schedule related to fees which allowed
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
some of some violations which used to be
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
must appear in court violations those
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
were allowed to be played by mail and so
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
those were some some of the higher speed
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh higher speed ticket violations and so
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
what we saw was an increase in plea by
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
mail in certain areas and a
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
corresponding decline here
 
01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:45.510 align:start position:0%
corresponding decline here
so

01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.390 align:start position:0%
so
in

01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
fy 20
 
01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.350 align:start position:0%
fy 20
um

01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
in fy 20 we collected 4.7 million
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
dollars um and in which which was less
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
percent 12 less than plan and fy 20
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
5.6 million less than plan fy 21
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
projecting to collect 7.4 million
 
01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:12.790 align:start position:0%
projecting to collect 7.4 million
dollars

01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
fy21 projecting to collect 4.3 million
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
dollars which is 640 000 or about 13
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
percent less than plan
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
our 22 and 23 projections are continuing
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
to show the slow recovery um kind of
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
tied in with the traffic assumptions we
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
have with roads
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
where again
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
less violations issued if there are less
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles on the road
 
01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.030 align:start position:0%
vehicles on the road
um

01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to move
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
by mail next so plea by mail is a
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
revenue source that was added to the
 
01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:43.910 align:start position:0%
revenue source that was added to the
fund

01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:44.870 align:start position:0%
fund
um

01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
in in this past
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
in fy
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
20 the first year was added to the
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
highway funds in that budget cycle that
 
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
was originally
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
revenue that was
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
quasi restricted so it was it was
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
restricted for use by the department of
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
safety in certain areas
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
and then excess that was collected above
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
appropriations was deposited into the
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the 2021 budget
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
was moved to be entirely
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
deposited into the highway fund
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh which makes sense if you think of the
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
nexus of this rev it's it's primarily
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
traffic violence um the dmv processes
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
those using their staff and so um it
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
does make sense that this revenue source
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
would now be reflected here
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
so in f120 um
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
for plea by mail we collected 5.6
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars which was about 2.8
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
million less than plan of 8.4
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
and in fy 21 projecting to collect 7.4
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
million which is a million less than
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
plan of 8.4 we really did take a hit
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
from a plea by mail perspective due to
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
those traffic uh reductions at the
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
beginning of the pandemic and also due
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
to um decreased enforcement activities
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
just um people were we're all sorting
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
out how do we respond and provide
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
services in this new environment
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's all since been resolved and so
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
we are seeing an increase in our plea by
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
mail revenues
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
do expect that um we'll flee by mail
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
will start to recover in 2023
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
and start slowly moving
 
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.669 align:start position:0%
and start slowly moving
towards

01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
towards
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
and then finally the green level here
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
these are the other miscellaneous motor
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle fees um
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
relatively small amount and um
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
not really significantly impacted uh by
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
coal thirds because they just fall into
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
the other the other category so we had
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
in fy 20 we collected 4.2 million about
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
950 000 more than planned and 21 were
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
3.5 million which is about uh 300 000 or
 
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
percent more than plan and we're going
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
to continue a slow recovery
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:02.239 --> 01:26:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
so then moving on to um general funds
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh we
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned we do have a small amount of
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
funds that we collect um these again
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
fall under the other category within the
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
general fund as a whole so so this
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
amount that safety collects is
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
co-mingled within that full amount um i
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
do believe administrative services
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
reports that other amount out
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
to you as well but just our share there
 
01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.270 align:start position:0%
to you as well but just our share there
um

01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
and so what you can see here
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
the initial plate fee is um
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
is an area where we where we have seen a
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
decline in revenue um so
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
fy 20 5.1 million in fy 21
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
we're projecting 3.9 million um
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
and and this has to do with vanity
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
plates and it also has to do with um
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
your initial driver left
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
and so the decline that we're seeing
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
really has to do with the fact that in
 
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and throughout the summer
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
the state's driving license uh schools
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
weren't able to
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
operate at full capacity and they all
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
chose different ways about addressing
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
things but at the end of the day there
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
are less new drivers um getting their
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
licenses right now than there were um in
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
the year prior so there's some pent-up
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
demand in this area that we'll start to
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
see in some recovery in the coming years
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
but that's why we do have a reduction
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
here it's it's not the vanity plates
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
it's the initial driver license for new
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
drivers in the state
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
um the general fund uh penalty
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
assessment so we we don't have
 
01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:45.990 align:start position:0%
assessment so we we don't have
significant

01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
declines there
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
we also don't have significant declines
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
in in permits and licensing in fact in
 
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
permits and licensing this is an area
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
where we went from 491 000 in fy 20 up
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
to 590 000 in fy21
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
we do expect that to decline in 22 and
 
01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:07.030 align:start position:0%
we do expect that to decline in 22 and
23.

01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
23.
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
the majority of this revenue that was
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
driving this increase had to do with
 
01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.950 align:start position:0%
driving this increase had to do with
non-resident

01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
non-resident
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
pistol licenses
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
and that's at a hundred dollars each and
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
so there was an increase in gun sales
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
and there was also an increase from out
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
of state
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
individuals seeking a non-resident
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
license in new hampshire
 
01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
we expect that to level off to
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
pre-pre-covet levels which has been
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
slowly phasing down
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
over time
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
because of the constitutional carry
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
changes that happen you know several
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
plumbers and gas fitters uh licensing
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
for those areas no real decline cova did
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
not impact the requirements to be
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
licensed to perform those services uh
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
and in fact a lot of people were getting
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
work done on their businesses and homes
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
um so there wasn't a decline in service
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
so so people stayed in business
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
and then just the other
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
categories nothing significant there
 
01:29:01.679 --> 01:29:03.350 align:start position:0%
categories nothing significant there
either

01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
so the factors impacting general fund
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
estimates i talked a little bit about
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
these i i won't i won't repeat myself
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
um initial plate and and initial license
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
and vanity plate fees so as we mentioned
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
it was the driver education schools uh
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
we expect it to recover in the next
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
couple of years penalty assessments so
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
this is when the court levies the
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
penalty of two dollars or two percent
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
and i have listed here where those go
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
the areas they support so 66.6 percent
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
supports the general fund and that's
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
what's represented in our estimates the
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
rest are the victims assistance fund and
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch who received the
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
information technology fund the judicial
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
branch who received the remainder
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
haven't really seen a significant impact
 
01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.709 align:start position:0%
haven't really seen a significant impact
there

01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
permits and licensing i mentioned the
 
01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:51.510 align:start position:0%
permits and licensing i mentioned the
resident

01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
resident
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
pistol license fees non-resident fees of
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollars
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
they have baseline revenue for detective
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
agencies and security agencies and
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
explosives handling that really didn't
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
change that wasn't really impacted by um
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
by covet 19 so we expect that to be to
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
to maintain uh but we do want expect
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
some fluctuation in the non-resident
 
01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.669 align:start position:0%
some fluctuation in the non-resident
licenses

01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
and then finally the plumbers and gas
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
fitter fees with mechanical licensing
 
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
and inspection
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
demand has has not declined in those
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
areas and so
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
businesses are doing well and people are
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
still maintaining their licenses
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
that is what we have for you today we
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
have also provided a
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
for the highway fund a separate document
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
just showing all the revenue sources
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
with the last since fy16 through our
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
projections um thought it might be
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
helpful for you as you're developing
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
your projections to have it all on on
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
one sheet um instead of having to work
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
through a presentation like this so
 
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
you should all have that if you if you
 
01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:01.990 align:start position:0%
you should all have that if you if you
don't

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
we can we can certainly provide that for
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
you as well
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
and would be happy to take any questions
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
that you may have
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your presentation uh
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
we can go directly to the
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
next presentation from the fish and game
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
commission and thanks again from the
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
department of state i actually had a i
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
actually had a question norman i didn't
 
01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
see your hand raised sorry i thought it
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
was up and it wasn't sorry
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
are we running late are we running late
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
norm i think
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
going with your question
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh real quick two quickies um
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
why is the real id
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory why is the real id fee
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
60 and a regular operator license 50
 
01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.709 align:start position:0%
60 and a regular operator license 50
dollars

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
is it because we have to deal with the
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
feds on this as more paperwork or
 
01:31:58.159 --> 01:31:59.510 align:start position:0%
feds on this as more paperwork or
something

01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
yeah it it that was a change that was
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
made in the last budget um and it does
 
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
have to do with the additional
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
documentation requirements that we have
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
um that we need to obtain and process to
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
issue the real id so there is an
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
incidental cost um to the department in
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
um in processing those and it was
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
determined that the additional fee would
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
account for that cost
 
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and the other quickie is
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
the 4.2 cent uh we we had to increase
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
the uh roto from 18 to 22.2
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
and where is the 4.2 going to these days
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
um i'll let scott uh jump in on that one
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
but that's a restricted
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
component that would not be reflected
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
here um so that's um
 
01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.310 align:start position:0%
here um so that's um
uh

01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that was for
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
was that for betterment or red listed
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
bridges scott
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
i would probably the best one to answer
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
that would i refer that question to the
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
department of transportation but i do
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
know that it was
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
a big portion of that was to uh
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
pay for the bonds for completing uh
 
01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:07.670 align:start position:0%
pay for the bonds for completing uh
the

01:33:07.670 --> 01:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:13.910 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'd rather defer that to dot because he
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
would be much more knowledgeable on the
 
01:33:17.679 --> 01:33:18.870 align:start position:0%
would be much more knowledgeable on the
exact

01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
exact
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
uses of those uh at that particular
 
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.550 align:start position:0%
uses of those uh at that particular
amounts

01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
chris you want to jump in on that chris
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
represent major you had mentioned fish
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
and game was next actually d.o.t is on
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
at 11 o'clock so you have plenty of time
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
to continue to ask questions and to
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
scott breyer's point uh dot is the next
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
agency to speak to you so they should be
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
questions can i ask another question
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
that normal yes i thought i was
 
01:33:47.990 --> 01:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
wondering i said geez my calendar had it
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of time here
 
01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:51.830 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of time here
um

01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
and this is for the committee too that
 
01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:54.790 align:start position:0%
and this is for the committee too that
uh

01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know the beauty of the highway fund
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
this was a constitutional change that
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
happened years ago
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
that forces us to spend
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh rotol on highways and not and not be
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
stolen for to fund other things which is
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
a problem in a lot of other states
 
01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.709 align:start position:0%
a problem in a lot of other states
um

01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
can anyone can any of you embellish on
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
that and how that's all worked out over
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
steve can you take that
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
sure so um
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think i think restricting the
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
the road toll are you referring to the
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
portions of the road toll that are
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
restricted versus the portions that are
 
01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.750 align:start position:0%
restricted versus the portions that are
unrestricted

01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
or the fact that the road toll itself
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
is only allowed to be used for the
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
highway fund it's necessarily allowed to
 
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
be used for the highway fund okay so uh
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's critical that the road toll
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
only be used for highway fund related
 
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
services um
 
01:35:05.189 --> 01:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is
 
01:35:07.110 --> 01:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
even with the road toll and with this
 
01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.590 align:start position:0%
even with the road toll and with this
restriction

01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
there is not sufficient
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
revenues being collected within that
 
01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:14.790 align:start position:0%
revenues being collected within that
fund

01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
fully support dot and to fully support
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh the department of safety and not
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
fully support the department of safety
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
but those areas of the department of
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
safety that are eligible for its use so
 
01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.430 align:start position:0%
safety that are eligible for its use so
if

01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.550 align:start position:0%
if
more

01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
uses were allowed
 
01:35:32.149 --> 01:35:32.159 align:start position:0%
the highway should likely be in even
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
worse shape
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
all right well i'll let it go with that
 
01:35:35.679 --> 01:35:36.390 align:start position:0%
all right well i'll let it go with that
i

01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
i know a lot of other states will
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
skim off the uh road toll or the gas tax
 
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:42.790 align:start position:0%
skim off the uh road toll or the gas tax
to

01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
fund other things that which can't
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
happen in this state it's my
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
understanding because of the
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
constitutional change years ago
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
um but i'll let it go with that thank
 
01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:52.310 align:start position:0%
um but i'll let it go with that thank
you

01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
hey steve can you put up that
 
01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:56.470 align:start position:0%
hey steve can you put up that
um

01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
the last chart which
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
you hadn't put up which shows all the
 
01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:06.470 align:start position:0%
you hadn't put up which shows all the
revenues

01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
shows the un unrestricted gross highway
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
this one here representative no it has
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%

01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
yes that one
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
would you briefly
 
01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
um sure so
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
we start with our um
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
our full
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
collections so gasoline road toll line
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is the primary collections for the
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
for the gas tax for the road toll uh we
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
also do collect some revenues from
 
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:22.870 align:start position:0%
also do collect some revenues from
um

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
from fines and
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
audits we have an audit section in road
 
01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:28.550 align:start position:0%
audits we have an audit section in road
toll

01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
toll
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure really we're trying to ensure
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance with with the road
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
toll but we do find things and we'll
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
issue um assessments and and penalty and
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
fines for unpaid road toll that was due
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
to the state uh and so we typically
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
collect you know anywhere from a hundred
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
and two to three 300 000 each year in
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
those areas
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
steve yeah to that a little
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
your scott
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay so basically in a nutshell road
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
toll fines is in that uh so somebody uh
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
is basically a the ten percent penalty
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
in uh the interest collected on people
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh we go out and do an audit if we found
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
somebody hadn't been paying us taxes
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
when we do an assessment there's a ten
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
percent penalty in uh
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
an interest rate right now it's around
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
five low over five percent interest on
 
01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:19.430 align:start position:0%
five low over five percent interest on
uh

01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
world totals that weren't paid on time
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
the other other world total revenues
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
that is exactly that is the after uh the
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
international fuel tax agreement uh all
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
the trucks uh any of the licensees have
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
to display a set of decals on both sides
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
of the trucks
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
that show that they're uh licensed for
 
01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:39.830 align:start position:0%
that show that they're uh licensed for
ifta

01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
ifta
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh that law enforcement can see
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
visually from the side of the road and
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh for a set of decals per per uh truck
 
01:38:50.590 --> 01:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
is ten dollars and that that
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
100 a little over a hundred thousand
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
dollars is from the sale of those if the
 
01:38:55.199 --> 01:38:58.790 align:start position:0%
dollars is from the sale of those if the
decals

01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
so then the next section has to do with
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
registration motor vehicle registrations
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
those are our state registrations um
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
which we which we have the graph that we
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
looked at earlier
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then we have two programs uh ucr and
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
irp and actually scott uh scott breyer
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
helps to administer both of these so um
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
scott do you wanna give a quick overview
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
of the of the two programs
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
the way i look at you the uci new
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire base is the fees that actually
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
people uh the people that um
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
licensed in new hampshire they buy they
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
go in when they register they say
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
they're based in new hampshire
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
and then the other fees are uh
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
the other fees are what's collected
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
nationally and it's one of those
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
programs that was uh it's it's actually
 
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
a federal program that's administered by
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
similar to like if they're an irp but
 
01:39:55.109 --> 01:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's unified carrier registration
 
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
and basically what happens is some
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
states collect uh for example new
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire's cat can't collect more than
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
like 2.29 million
 
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.709 align:start position:0%
like 2.29 million
so

01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
what happens is everybody's guaranteed a
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
set allotment
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
so what happens is once we collect our
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
money um
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
anytime we collect more than like say
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
2.3 million we have to pay that money
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
back to the depository
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
so for example states like california
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
texas actually collect more revenue than
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
their what they call their cap is for
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
their program so all the extra money
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
goes into uh this other one
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
the other state collections and that's
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
allocated to all the states based on
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
whether they met their caps or not so
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's one of those programs where we're
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to get a set like 2.29
 
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
million a year
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
they add those two amounts together
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
scott why is the ucr new hampshire base
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
so much higher in 2020 actual than all
 
01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
the others
 
01:41:01.030 --> 01:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's more than twice the amount
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
oh um i think that was actually uh an
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
internal mistake here where uh
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
the money was coming in and uh the the
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
office had uh
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
you usually look at those two accounts
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
you add them together i think that was
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
just a mishap where they were putting
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
into the wrong receipt account
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it's because your total is
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
almost the same yeah so if you told yeah
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
if you look at the totals they're going
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
to be the two add the two together
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
they'll be pretty much the same
 
01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:33.270 align:start position:0%
they'll be pretty much the same
okay

01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
so then moving on um motor vehicle
 
01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.270 align:start position:0%
so then moving on um motor vehicle
respiration

01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
respiration
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
um we go into uh operators and so this
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
next line is our driver license revenue
 
01:41:44.639 --> 01:41:45.510 align:start position:0%
next line is our driver license revenue
um

01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:47.430 --> 01:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
and so again corresponds directly to the
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
chart that we had showed earlier
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
the next section has to do with
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
inspection station fees so these are
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
stickers and station fees um here you
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
can see the split
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
and really see the every other year
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
aspect of the station fee licenses
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
um and then the sticker revenue itself
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh next is certificate of title so again
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
this amount corresponds to to the chart
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
um that we looked at previously where
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's pretty
 
01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:17.669 align:start position:0%
it's pretty
uh

01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
pretty flat
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
very little change in that in that area
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
and then we get into the other
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous fees category you'll see
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
plea by mail the new revenue source for
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
the highway fund that was added here
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
um you know plea by mail has been over 8
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
million in the past
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
knowing that because it wasn't part of
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
the highway fund then
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
but as we mentioned we expect to
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
do to achieve pre-covered levels um or
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
head towards pre-coped levels there
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
some small validation stamp deposit
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
revenue some miscellaneous fees the
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
overweight application fees this isn't
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
this is another area the overweight
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
vehicles um getting an application for
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
um for that transport relatively flat
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
and stable not impacted by covid we've
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
still had uh commercial vehicle um
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
activity in the state
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
license restorations uh fees associated
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
with uh if you lose your license in
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
order to have it recovered through
 
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
hearings um those are the same area
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
we've got similar amounts as in prior
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
years um a little bit of a decline based
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
on 19 but we're still expecting to
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
recover most of those
 
01:43:32.950 --> 01:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
non-driver ids um we did see some a
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
decline in non-driver ids uh obviously
 
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
many people not driver id are typically
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
um are often older adults um but
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
we we
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
some people weren't comfortable coming
 
01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
into the dmv if they needed a new a new
 
01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:50.950 align:start position:0%
into the dmv if they needed a new a new
id

01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
id
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
overweight vehicle fines this one's
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
really hard to
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
project because it's going to depend
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
upon um depend upon enforcement
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
activities and depend upon the safety of
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
the carriers that are out there on the
 
01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.750 align:start position:0%
the carriers that are out there on the
roads

01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
roads
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
and what their weight loads are like so
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
we usually project uh budget about 150
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
000 uh and if we get a little extra
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of extra that we're
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
happy to receive
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
registration restorations
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
again some revenue here but not a huge
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
amount this is the next big one motor
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle fines judicial branch so we had
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
spoken about that earlier these are the
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
fees from
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
violations if you can test your ticket
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
you go to the courts
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the judge still says nope you must
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
pay those those are where those amounts
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
go um and so as the courts start ramping
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
back up to fully we expect those
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
sources will start recovering
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
as well uh and then finally the last
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
line is sale of vehicles um that is uh
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
any vehicles that we purchase with
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
highway funds um if we um
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
if we sell that vehicle light farm those
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
revenues are collected and deposited
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
back for many sales like that so
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we can sell a vehicle that's
 
01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
used um
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
even if it's a cruiser we we take the we
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
take all of the markings off we paint it
 
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
so it's a single color we remove all the
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement equipment and we may
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
still get uh fifteen hundred dollars two
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for each one of the
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
cruisers even after they're beyond end
 
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
of life going through the the white farm
 
01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
surplus process
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
and then your total here uh um
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
is at the bottom
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
and again this is unrestricted uh so
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
this would be any of those restricted
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
highway fund rep that go directly to
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
d.o.t that uh representative rami was
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
was speaking about
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
represents uh almy has a question
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm way back up on
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle registration section
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
most of that is on conformity with out
 
01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
of state versus in-state based
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
on trucks do
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
we've lost a lot of truck registrations
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
to maine
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh even though they're based here
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.159 --> 01:46:22.149 align:start position:0%
 
steve

01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
steve
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
yeah scott can you address that
 
01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
so let me explain something about the
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
two programs irp is the international
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
registration plan
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
so how irp works is
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like if the
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
based on where the trucks go it's based
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
on where they travel so they pay at a
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
portion registration fee so even though
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
those trucks are registered in maine
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
portion plate in maine they have to uh
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
they have to allocate the portion of
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
time they're into new hampshire that has
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
to be denoted on the registration so
 
01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
with if they're an irp it's just a
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
reallocation of the fees based on where
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
the trucks actually drive not where
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
they're actually registered does that
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
so we don't really lose revenue on that
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
just based on where they the miles with
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
trucks actually drive
 
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you but what about on ucr
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
so ucr what that is is uci new hampshire
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
based that's actually money that when
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
they registered they knew
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
they registered and they put on the
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
website that they were based in new
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire that money comes directly to
 
01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:35.430 align:start position:0%
hampshire that money comes directly to
us

01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
the ucr other states is money that was
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
collected by other states but because
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
for example in uh fiscal year 20
 
01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.590 align:start position:0%
for example in uh fiscal year 20
um

01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
well that's a bad year because that was
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
the one that was a little messed up but
 
01:47:53.669 --> 01:47:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh for example in fiscal year 19 we
 
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
collected about 900 000 and our cap was
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
like it's approximately a little lower
 
01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
than 2.3 million
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
so what they do is you add those two
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
that that 2.8 million right there that's
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's all our money you add those two
 
01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
together and that's all the state's
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
money it just just happened to be
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
collected outside our state and
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
because our cap is 2.3 million we get
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
allocated that money from the depository
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
so it's still our money and scott is it
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that we um
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
in all likely
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
the cap is a is a ceiling for us
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
actually more revenue if the cap didn't
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
exist oh yeah if we didn't have the cash
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
for example if we didn't have exactly
 
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
steve if we didn't have the cap we would
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
only collect what whatever they paid to
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
our state
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
so each state has a cap
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
and yeah that's actually
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
did i just ask is that based off of the
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
irp results
 
01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:57.270 align:start position:0%
irp results
well

01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
let me put you this way basically any
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle any vehicle that operates uh in
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
the state one outside of new hampshire
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire has to have ucr
 
01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:08.709 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire has to have ucr
credentials

01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
01:49:08.719 --> 01:49:09.910 align:start position:0%
credentials
ifta

01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
ifta
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
and irp
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
all trucks that operate like that those
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
three credentials
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
those trucks that operate interstate all
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
you all said
 
01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:25.510 align:start position:0%
you all said
okay

01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's very
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
complicated okay uh we'll have them back
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
again representative ames
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
before you do representatives uh when we
 
01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
do our work sessions
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh this will probably elicit a lot of
 
01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
questions and we'll have the department
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
back to be able to address these
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative ames
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
okay i thank you
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
this perhaps could be a question that
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
could be answered when they come back
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
but it's a it's a follow-up from
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative ramy's earlier question
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
and it's on the gasoline road toll and
 
01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:05.750 align:start position:0%
and it's on the gasoline road toll and
uh

01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i think scott you said that you do
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
factor in the move towards more
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
efficient or
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
totally electric vehicles and
 
01:50:18.310 --> 01:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
but you didn't say how you factor that
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
in i think it would be helpful to us to
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
understand your
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
the assumptions that you're using as you
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
factor in what is undoubtedly
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
a move towards less gasoline
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
consumption per vehicle i guess a per
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
mile traveled
 
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
as we go forward into an era where
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
public policy is going to be pushing
 
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
yeah we can certainly um when it gets
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
time for the work sessions we could
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
certainly uh share with you
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
those assumptions and how we apply them
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
to the to the estimates
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
um it's at this point it's it's really
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
challenging because we're dealing with
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
the traffic volume and gallon
 
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
consumption issues as well so it's it's
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
more of an art than a science for this
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
biennium but um to your point um
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
yeah we we can certainly explain you
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
know how we apply to our to our percent
 
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:23.030 align:start position:0%
know how we apply to our to our percent
increases

01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
increases
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
all right there's no other questions and
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
we are right on time and i'm glad we
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
have chris and others to keep me honest
 
01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:36.709 align:start position:0%
have chris and others to keep me honest
here

01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%

here
so

01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you scott

all right
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
we will go right into the department of
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
transportation we have the deputy
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%

that we would like to go through i'm
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
just going to provide a very brief
 
01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:26.070 align:start position:0%
just going to provide a very brief
um

um
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
high level overview of the department
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
marie's going to get into
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
um the unrestricted revenue projections
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
and the financial aspects of the
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
department uh hopefully we'll be able to
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
get through the presentation in about 20
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
minutes and then we'll have
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
10 minutes for any questions and answers
 
01:52:43.679 --> 01:52:44.470 align:start position:0%
10 minutes for any questions and answers
um

01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
is that is that okay
 
01:52:50.310 --> 01:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
mr chair that's fine okay great so marie
 
01:52:54.070 --> 01:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:56.950 --> 01:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
so um here's a mission and purpose you
 
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
know basically
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's the mission is simple and
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
straightforward transportation
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
excellence enhancing the quality of life
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
um in a couple key words that i want to
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
focus on
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
um transportation excellence the way we
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
view it it's it's fundamental to the
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
state's economic development and land
 
01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:15.750 align:start position:0%
state's economic development and land
use

01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh fundamentally enhancing the the
 
01:53:18.239 --> 01:53:19.350 align:start position:0%
uh fundamentally enhancing the the
environment

01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
preserving the unique character and
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
quality of life
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that the
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
transportation system is safe secure
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
there's travel options for all our
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
residents and visitors
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
and the movement of goods um
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
is is efficient and the system is is
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
well maintained efficient and reliable
 
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
and again provide seamless interstate
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
into intra state connectivity so um that
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
is that is what we strive for
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
here's the way the department's
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
organized um in essence there's three
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
commissioners commissioner victoria
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
sheehan um
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner and chief
 
01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:03.910 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner and chief
engineer

01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
bill cass and then myself as the as the
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's five divisions
 
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
project development division and
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
operation division report under
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
the assistant commissioner and chief
 
01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:17.589 align:start position:0%
the assistant commissioner and chief
engineer

01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
and then the divisions of finance policy
 
01:54:20.159 --> 01:54:21.430 align:start position:0%
and then the divisions of finance policy
administration

01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
and aeronautics rail and transit report
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
under um
 
01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:27.510 align:start position:0%
under um
myself

01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
each division has a number of different
 
01:54:29.199 --> 01:54:30.390 align:start position:0%
each division has a number of different
bureaus

01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
bureaus
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
i like for example project development
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
there are eight bureaus listed there
 
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
actually the seven bureaus and there's
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
project management
 
01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:39.750 align:start position:0%
project management
um

01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
listed and
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
that division really formulates
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and develops
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
all the projects that are listed in a
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
that division is responsible for
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
executing those projects and delivering
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
those projects on the 10-year plan
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
schedule we have operations
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
those bureaus are responsible for
 
01:55:02.470 --> 01:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know in essence maintaining and
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
operating the system that we have
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
in place
 
01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.189 align:start position:0%
in place
finance

01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
finance
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
is responsible for all the budgeting and
 
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
financial and in contractual as well as
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
auditing functions of the department
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
policy administration primarily human
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
resources and compliance
 
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
on communications and then we have
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
aeronautics rail and transit which are
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
in essence
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
associated with those three branches of
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
the transportation system so that's the
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
way we're structured
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
some key facts about the department
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
we have 1650 permanent employees
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
those are both
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
classified and unclassified
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
we have right now we have a very high
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate i think our vacancy rate is
 
01:55:53.199 --> 01:55:54.310 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate i think our vacancy rate is
upwards

01:55:54.310 --> 01:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
upwards
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
over 15 percent which is very concerning
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
the pandemics certainly
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh required us to focus on limiting our
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
expenses and that was one area that um
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
was was identified to limit hiring um on
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
on the asset side we have a little over
 
01:56:15.199 --> 01:56:16.790 align:start position:0%
on the asset side we have a little over
2100

01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
2100
 
01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:17.830 align:start position:0%
2100
bridges

01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
bridges
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
um from a red list standpoint and the
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
red list in essence is uh
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
registered a deficient uh we have 125 on
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
the state side
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
on the municipal side there are almost
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
1700 municipal bridges
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
the municipal red list has 243 so you
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
can see it's a much higher percentage
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
of red less bridges on the municipal
 
01:56:41.669 --> 01:56:41.679 align:start position:0%
side than the state side
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
that is very much a focus of the
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
department as well as the legislatures
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
all bridges are inspected every two
 
01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:49.990 align:start position:0%
all bridges are inspected every two
years

01:56:49.990 --> 01:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
the red list bridges are inspected more
 
01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
frequently i would say roughly every six
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
months to make sure that those bridges
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
are safe to carry the traffic
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
we have roughly
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
a little over 4
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
4 600 centerline miles of roadway that
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
we manage
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
there are additional 300
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
town maintained
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
miles within the urban compacts
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
we strive to pave a little over 10
 
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
percent of that
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
roughly and it's more of a target than
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
than a total
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
we try to target 550 cell line miles per
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
year that we pave and we've been able to
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
do that i believe over the last seven
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
years we've been able to
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
reach or exceed that target which has
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
really increased the quality and
 
01:57:44.070 --> 01:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
condition of our road system
 
01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:46.310 align:start position:0%
condition of our road system
um

01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
roughly seven years ago in 2014 68
 
01:57:51.430 --> 01:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
percent of our roads were in good and
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
fair condition
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
um into uh 2019 82 percent of our roads
 
01:57:59.030 --> 01:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
were in good and for their condition
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
so that focused effort is really paying
 
01:58:01.679 --> 01:58:02.709 align:start position:0%
so that focused effort is really paying
dividends

01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh we maintain more than a hundred
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
thousand highway signs
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
strike more than 75 million feet of uh
 
01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:11.750 align:start position:0%
strike more than 75 million feet of uh
striping

01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
striping
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
and then we have 440 traffic signals
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we also maintain um those are some
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
of our other major assets on the rail
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
side we have 195 miles of active
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
state-owned rail lines i believe we have
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
over 200 miles of inactive state-owned
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
rail lines as well that we oversee
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
25 publicly accessible airports and i
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
believe it's 11 not 12 local public
 
01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
transit systems so
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of some of our key facts
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
of the department
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to turn it over to marie
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
marlin to talk about the financial
 
01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:51.510 align:start position:0%
marlin to talk about the financial
aspects

01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
so marie
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chris um marie mullen as
 
01:58:58.709 --> 01:58:58.719 align:start position:0%
representative major said i'm the
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
director of finance here at d.o.t
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
just a brief overview here of the
 
01:59:07.589 --> 01:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
department's actual expenditures for
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2020.
 
01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
we we like to show our budget split
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
between operating and then the municipal
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
aid and construction
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
that blue part of the pie chart the
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
municipal aid and construction that's
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
primarily our 10-year plan which is
 
01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
passed by the legislature
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
and begins later this year and during
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
the fy 22 session that goes through
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
um several steps through the gasset
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
process with governor and council
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
and then to the governor to the house
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
and to the senate all to weigh in on the
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
the 10 year plan project so that's
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
primarily that blue section
 
01:59:46.149 --> 01:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
and then the orange section is the
 
01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
department's operating
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
um section so
 
01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
just to give you some context the
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
operating piece for fy 20 was about 38
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
percent of total expenditures and the
 
01:59:59.589 --> 01:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
municipal aid in construction was 62
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:04.629 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
as you can see the department has is
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
comprised of various funding sources you
 
02:00:10.950 --> 02:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
can see highway
 
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
is just over federal is the is the most
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
but we have a significant portion
 
02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
of our budget is federally funded
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
and then we have the turnpike system
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
other we have some restricted revenues
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
and then the general fund is about one
 
02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:25.990 align:start position:0%
and then the general fund is about one
percent

02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
and that's primarily our aeronautics and
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
railroad bureaus
 
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
so just a little background on the
 
02:00:41.090 --> 02:00:41.100 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:42.629 align:start position:0%
highway fund
[Music]

02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
we we just like to to tell folks the
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
highway fund is not the d.o.t and d.o.t
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
is not the highway fund
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
as you just finished safety's
 
02:00:53.910 --> 02:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
presentation safety is the department
 
02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:54.950 align:start position:0%
presentation safety is the department
which

02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:00:56.870 --> 02:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
collects the unrestricted revenue
 
02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
related to the
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
road toll and registration fees
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's the primary source for
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
the operating budget for both
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
safety dot the judicial branch and uh
 
02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679 align:start position:0%
injustice all get
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
portions of the highway fund from the
 
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
revenues that are collected those
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
so next to look at
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of what dot is
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
responsible for the yellow highlighted
 
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
section are miscellaneous revenues in
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
the highway fund
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
that is what dot
 
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
has been
 
02:01:36.629 --> 02:01:36.639 align:start position:0%
responsible for in collecting in the
 
02:01:36.639 --> 02:01:37.589 align:start position:0%
responsible for in collecting in the
past

02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
past
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
the other revenues there are what safety
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
collects and they just presented that
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
information to you um previous to this
 
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
if we like to just show this historical
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
view of the highway fund so that you can
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
see some of the
 
02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:53.350 align:start position:0%
see some of the
um

02:01:53.350 --> 02:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:54.870 align:start position:0%
um
one-time

02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
one-time
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh short-term revenues that have that
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
were presented in the past to try to
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
shore up the highway fund but they were
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
all just temporary kind of fixes
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
so back in 2010 and 2011 there was a 30
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
registration surcharge and that was
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
repealed in 2012 so you can see those
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
significant declines
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
in revenue at that time
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
we had some other one time in the yellow
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
area related to retro turnpike toll
 
02:02:24.159 --> 02:02:25.189 align:start position:0%
area related to retro turnpike toll
credits

02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
credits
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
those were
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know one-time toll credits that we
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
were able to go back and
 
02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
and um collect
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
is now you know has been gone for many
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
years we use toll credits now to match
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
our federal program because we're
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
required to do either a 10 or 20 match
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
on our federal projects
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
so we're using toll credits exclusively
 
02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
to match that program
 
02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:52.719 align:start position:0%
that's not revenue what it does is it
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
basically makes our projects a hundred
 
02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
percent federal funds
 
02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:58.550 align:start position:0%
percent federal funds
so

02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
this isn't revenue that we're collecting
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
um coming into the department
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
and then of course
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
some of you i'm sure are very familiar
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
with the i-95 i-95 sale of the
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
high-level bridge to the turnpike system
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
um so that was originally supposed to be
 
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
paid off over 20 years
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
and as you can see here it was paid off
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
over seven um so during that time those
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
revenues came into the highway fund from
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
um to pay for that bridge um and that's
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
been fully paid off so those revenues
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
are now gone
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
the miscellaneous
 
02:03:35.830 --> 02:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
is related to
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
federal indirect revenue that we receive
 
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
back in 2014 that became restricted
 
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
revenue and is applied to the
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
department's operating budget so um it's
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
just moved from unrestricted to
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
restricted um in that piece but then you
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
can see that the department's
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
you know miscellaneous revenue is a
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
small portion a couple hundred thousand
 
02:04:02.629 --> 02:04:02.639 align:start position:0%
um a year
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i'll get into those projections in a
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
second but i just wanted to show you
 
02:04:08.390 --> 02:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
some of that history
 
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
some of the one-time short-term
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
revenue items that have come in to try
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
to shore up the fund
 
02:04:15.679 --> 02:04:17.589 align:start position:0%
to shore up the fund
temporarily

02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
temporarily
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
so here are dots miscellaneous revenue
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
projections um
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
these there are no changes to this so
 
02:04:33.109 --> 02:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
the forecast and the budget is what was
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
originally submitted
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
um we anticipate to collect um you know
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
these small amounts of money for either
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
plant sales
 
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
junkyard licenses and some other small
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
items we have and then right-of-way
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
property sales
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
when we sell properties um they're
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
generally surplus related to the federal
 
02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.149 align:start position:0%
generally surplus related to the federal
program

02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
so we're required
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me required by federal law
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
to restrict any revenue we receive from
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
those surplus lands that was federally
 
02:05:05.599 --> 02:05:06.790 align:start position:0%
those surplus lands that was federally
related

02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
related
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
and it has to go back
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
towards federal projects
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
so what you see here is only the portion
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
that the state paid so if it was there
 
02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
was a 10 or 20 percent match that we had
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
paid in highway funds in the past
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
then that revenue that portion that 10
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
or 20 percent would go here into the
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
highway fund is unrestricted revenue so
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
those sales are a smaller number because
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
it's really a very
 
02:05:32.719 --> 02:05:34.310 align:start position:0%
it's really a very
finite

02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
finite
 
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
portion of those sales that go back into
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
the highway fund
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
and as we've moved to a hundred percent
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
federal uh using toll credits
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
um more of the current properties if
 
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
they get sold for surplus 100 of it goes
 
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
back to the federal program so
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
we don't those revenues wouldn't go back
 
02:05:57.030 --> 02:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
so that is what i have on the highway
 
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
fund i don't know if there are any
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
questions i know there was a question in
 
02:06:04.709 --> 02:06:04.719 align:start position:0%
the last um
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
safety's presentation on the 4.2 cents
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to address that now for
 
02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:10.709 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to address that now for
folks

02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
folks
 
02:06:10.719 --> 02:06:11.589 align:start position:0%
folks
so

02:06:11.589 --> 02:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
back in 2014
 
02:06:17.189 --> 02:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
there was an additional 4.2 cents um
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
increase in the road toll
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:06:23.109 --> 02:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
designated for
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
bonding and to pay the debt service to
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
complete i-93
 
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
so there was a waterfall effect of that
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
so 12 goes to block grant
 
02:06:32.159 --> 02:06:33.189 align:start position:0%
so 12 goes to block grant
then

02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:06:36.550 --> 02:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
um debt service on i-93
 
02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
then 6.8 million goes to towards state
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
aid bridges so that's the state aid
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
bridge program the municipal bridges
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
and then the remainder of any revenue
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
that comes in
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
goes towards the betterment program
 
02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:51.750 align:start position:0%
goes towards the betterment program
and

02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:53.669 --> 02:06:53.679 align:start position:0%
some of you may remember
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
we entered into a tiffy alone back in
 
02:06:55.599 --> 02:06:57.109 align:start position:0%
we entered into a tiffy alone back in
2016

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
2016
 
02:06:59.189 --> 02:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
and we deferred the principal payments
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
for nine years so during this nine year
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
period we are using those funds um we we
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
have a covenant on the loan that
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
requires us to use those betterment
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
funds to for rural pavement and bridges
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
so chris had mentioned the improvement
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the system these this money that we
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
have been putting towards
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
um the paving and the bridges is why you
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
know has helped in why you're seeing
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
the benefit and the the
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
the increase in our in our
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
good good and fair payment condition
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately in
 
02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
2025 the debt service on the tifia loan
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh begins so
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
all of those funds that were going
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
towards betterment will now be going
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
towards the principal and interest debt
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
service payments
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
um so we will see a significant decline
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
in what will be you know we'll be using
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
from those revenues on pavement and
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
bridges um and as it will be going
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
towards debt service so i hope that
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
answers um the representative's question
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
on the 4.2 cents and what's being used
 
02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:08.629 align:start position:0%
on the 4.2 cents and what's being used
on

02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:11.430 --> 02:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
i believe has a follow-up question
 
02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.189 align:start position:0%
i believe has a follow-up question
okay

02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative bromley
 
02:08:20.069 --> 02:08:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative romney you need to unmute
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i thought i did i'm sorry
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
so yeah my basic question is i i know
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
i-93 is is nearing uh and the
 
02:08:35.109 --> 02:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
construction is nearing an end other
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
than the discussion of exit 4a still
 
02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:38.950 align:start position:0%
than the discussion of exit 4a still
exists

02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
exists
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh and is
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering where the money
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
that was going to i-93 was going and i
 
02:08:47.430 --> 02:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
think you you kind of explained it
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
um but that was the basis of my question
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
but what is going on with exit 4a while
 
02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
we're at it
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
i'll let chris address that
 
02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
so representative um you know thank you
 
02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
for the question i-93 in essence has
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
been completed
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
the 200 million dollar tiffy alone that
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
we received has been expended um
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
if it you know it's nearly in full if
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
not in full
 
02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:12.550 align:start position:0%
not in full
um

02:09:12.550 --> 02:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:13.350 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know so that that money basically
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
now we're going to be paying the uh the
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
tipia debt service on interest only as
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
marie explained through 2025 and then
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
principal and interest beyond that
 
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
exit 4a is funded um it's fully funded
 
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
with federal aid and
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
in essence
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
that project initially was
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
planned to be a design build
 
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
type of procurement
 
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
um when the when the bids were open for
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
that design build procurement they were
 
02:09:51.270 --> 02:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
um very high i think they were
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
over 30 percent higher than the
 
02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
department's estimate so the department
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
has um decided to
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
pursue that project in a different
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
manner um
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
we're pursuing it
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know based on our typical design bid
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
build which will allow us
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
more control over
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know certain aspects of the design
 
02:10:16.709 --> 02:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
and um the plan is to bring that project
 
02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
in line with what the
 
02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
dollars in the 10-year plan were
 
02:10:21.199 --> 02:10:22.229 align:start position:0%
dollars in the 10-year plan were
so

02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
there will be a little delay in
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
construction i think that you know the
 
02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:27.589 align:start position:0%
construction i think that you know the
construction

02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
we may be talking about um
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
several months to maybe six month delay
 
02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
into construction staff from what the
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
original design build
 
02:10:36.159 --> 02:10:37.350 align:start position:0%
original design build
um

02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:38.709 --> 02:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
plan was
 
02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
the first contract right now is planned
 
02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
the first contract right now is planned
to

02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
um go out in
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
on the spring of next year
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
okay thanks thank you chris good good
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
explanation appreciate it okay uh
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative army
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:10:57.520 --> 02:10:59.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
on

02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
chris the
 
02:11:03.750 --> 02:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
you'd said that we've made considerable
 
02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
progress on the pavement i take it
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
that's starting in 25 we're going to
 
02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
start to regress on that and also is
 
02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
that going to affect municipal bridge
 
02:11:14.079 --> 02:11:15.030 align:start position:0%
that going to affect municipal bridge
work

02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
which i think we're still arguing about
 
02:11:20.950 --> 02:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question those
 
02:11:25.030 --> 02:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
are those are good questions um
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
so yes we are going to see a decline in
 
02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
the amount of pavement we're going to be
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
able to do
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
beginning in 2026.
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
we're trying to dedicate some additional
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
federal funds at that time
 
02:11:41.189 --> 02:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
to the paving program
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
um to kind of
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
make up for for that loss however
 
02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
the key
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
is that we have roughly i believe i'm
 
02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
speaking off the top of my head
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
eleven hundred
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh miles of state roads that are not
 
02:11:59.669 --> 02:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal aid
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
and that's where a lot of the a lot of
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
this tiffia money was uh was directed to
 
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
those type of roads
 
02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:07.270 align:start position:0%
those type of roads
so

02:12:07.270 --> 02:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of the amount of federal aid
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
we receive we will not be able to use
 
02:12:13.990 --> 02:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
that on those roads and that's where
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to really see a decline
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
so that is a real concern for the
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
department once that once that happens
 
02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
in 26.
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
um we've been making great gains um
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
on on the paving side with both the
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
tiffy pledged work as well as
 
02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:34.629 align:start position:0%
tiffy pledged work as well as
um

02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
the federal funded work that we have on
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the state bridge program i
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
don't believe um
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
within this
 
02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
next five to seven year time frame there
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
will be any impact to the
 
02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
6.8 million pledge that we have
 
02:12:53.910 --> 02:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
however um
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to remind the committee that
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
that tiffy alone
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
sunsets in 2034
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
um as well as the 4.2 gas tax increase
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
sunsets at that time as well in
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
legislation so
 
02:13:08.639 --> 02:13:10.229 align:start position:0%
legislation so
um

02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have a problem sometime in the
 
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.990 align:start position:0%
we'll have a problem sometime in the
future

02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
if it's not addressed on the municipal
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
all right i don't see any other hands
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
right so
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
you can continue
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh so now we'll um move to the turnpike
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
system um i know this is uh
 
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know not necessarily
 
02:13:39.589 --> 02:13:39.599 align:start position:0%
um part of your purview and your
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
estimates but uh we wanted to to present
 
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
to you the information related to the
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
turnpike system especially related to
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
covid and the the traffic and
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
transaction changes that we've seen
 
02:13:51.679 --> 02:13:53.030 align:start position:0%
transaction changes that we've seen
so

02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:55.270 --> 02:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
the department is also responsible for
 
02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
which has three segments
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
is approximately 89 miles in length
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
and it is an enterprise fund so all the
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
turnpike revenue must be used on the
 
02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
turnpike system it cannot be used on
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
highway state roads
 
02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:14.130 align:start position:0%
general funds anything like that
 
02:14:14.130 --> 02:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
general funds anything like that
[Music]

02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:18.550 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
one thing about the turnpike system is
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
because we have revenue bonds it
 
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
requires the turnpike system to adhere
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
to the covenants
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
which include maintaining our existing
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
system before we can increase increased
 
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
capacity with large projects so you can
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
see here we're required with our revenue
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
to first pay operating and maintenance
 
02:14:38.159 --> 02:14:39.109 align:start position:0%
to first pay operating and maintenance
costs

02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
then debt service
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
then r r which is renewal and
 
02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:44.709 align:start position:0%
then r r which is renewal and
replacement

02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
on the on the system
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
once those things are taken care of and
 
02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
are in you know fair and good condition
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
then we can spend additional revenue on
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
capital improvements
 
02:14:57.910 --> 02:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know widenings and capacity
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
improvements and those type of things
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
so for fy20 we had about 110 million
 
02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:06.550 align:start position:0%
so for fy20 we had about 110 million
transactions

02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
that was a reduction of 11.6 percent
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
compared to fy19
 
02:15:14.629 --> 02:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
our total revenue was 131 million which
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
was a reduction of 10.6 percent compared
 
02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
to fy 19. so we did see
 
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
a significant reduction um in our
 
02:15:28.229 --> 02:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
revenue and transactions related to fy20
 
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
and that's just from the three months of
 
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
covid um so that's not even a full year
 
02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:34.229 align:start position:0%
covid um so that's not even a full year
impact

02:15:34.229 --> 02:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
um here's some graphs and information on
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
our current traffic trends
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
so you can see
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
um the traffic on this 15-year trend
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
line you can see it just went like a
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
cliff in fy 20.
 
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
this chart over here has our fy 21
 
02:15:53.109 --> 02:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
traffic by week
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
um so through january 17th overall year
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
to date we were down traffic by 19.5
 
02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:00.069 align:start position:0%
to date we were down traffic by 19.5
percent

02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:16:03.189 --> 02:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
um and you can see we you know we had
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
back in september
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know we were seeing it come back a
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
little bit but then right after october
 
02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
and um um
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know the october vacation weekend
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
there it jumped back up again and we
 
02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
were seeing you know back in the 20
 
02:16:20.069 --> 02:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
percent range
 
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh and even up to 30 around thanksgiving
 
02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:23.990 align:start position:0%
uh and even up to 30 around thanksgiving
so

02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
um we still are not seeing that um
 
02:16:29.109 --> 02:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
traffic coming back to the turnpike
 
02:16:29.119 --> 02:16:30.390 align:start position:0%
traffic coming back to the turnpike
system

02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:31.990 align:start position:0%
system
um

02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's primarily the commuting traffic and
 
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
the reduced vacation and pleasure travel
 
02:16:38.709 --> 02:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
that's continuing to impact the
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
transactions our commercial traffic um
 
02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
has come back and that is back to
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
pre-covered levels
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
but it's not enough obviously to to
 
02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.549 align:start position:0%
but it's not enough obviously to to
impact

02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:52.129 --> 02:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
our revenue significantly
 
02:16:52.139 --> 02:16:54.150 align:start position:0%
our revenue significantly
[Music]

02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
so and then
 
02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
here's a view of our historical turnpike
 
02:16:58.160 --> 02:16:59.669 align:start position:0%
here's a view of our historical turnpike
revenues

02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
you can see we were seeing
 
02:17:04.389 --> 02:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
you know modest increases
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
over the past five years and then again
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
an fy 20
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
here are projections um moving forward
 
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
on the turnpike fund
 
02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:18.629 align:start position:0%
on the turnpike fund
so

02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
you can see our fy21 this is a revised
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
estimate we recently had a third party
 
02:17:24.319 --> 02:17:25.669 align:start position:0%
estimate we recently had a third party
expert

02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
expert
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
do revenue projections for us so that's
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
what is reflected here
 
02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:30.950 align:start position:0%
what is reflected here
they

02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:32.070 align:start position:0%
they
they

02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
are experts in the industry and have
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
done projections for many other turnpike
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
systems around the country including
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
maine and massachusetts and various
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
others so they're very familiar with the
 
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
trends and what's going on
 
02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:46.150 align:start position:0%
trends and what's going on
um

02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:46.950 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
you know they they're beginning to so
 
02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
these projections show that you know
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're beginning they're gonna begin to
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
see increases for seasonal and
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
vacationers over time over the next
 
02:17:58.709 --> 02:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
three years but it assumes we continue
 
02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
to see reduced traffic related to the
 
02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:02.389 align:start position:0%
to see reduced traffic related to the
commuters

02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
commuters
 
02:18:02.399 --> 02:18:03.190 align:start position:0%
commuters
um

02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
they're they're thinking that it's going
 
02:18:07.110 --> 02:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
to take at least three years before the
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
volumes return to where they were
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
related to the commuters
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
so that's reflected here in our revenue
 
02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:14.709 align:start position:0%
so that's reflected here in our revenue
estimates

02:18:14.709 --> 02:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
02:18:14.719 --> 02:18:16.070 align:start position:0%
estimates
um

02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
so you can see
 
02:18:17.519 --> 02:18:19.190 align:start position:0%
so you can see
fy21

02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
fy21
 
02:18:22.629 --> 02:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating a 6.9 decrease over
 
02:18:22.639 --> 02:18:24.709 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating a 6.9 decrease over
fy20

02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
fy20
 
02:18:27.669 --> 02:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
and that's an 11 decrease over our
 
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
original plan our original plan was
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
137.8 million
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
for fy21 um and you can see we're
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
expecting 121 million so that's about 11
 
02:18:37.599 --> 02:18:38.870 align:start position:0%
expecting 121 million so that's about 11
decrease

02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
um and then moving forward we do
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
anticipate to start seeing you know
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
increases coming back
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
as the vaccines get out as people feel
 
02:18:49.669 --> 02:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
more comfortable traveling vacationing
 
02:18:49.679 --> 02:18:50.709 align:start position:0%
more comfortable traveling vacationing
again

02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
we anticipate to see some additional
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
revenue there
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
our other toll operating revenue
 
02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
we're seeing some increases there and
 
02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:01.429 align:start position:0%
we're seeing some increases there and
that's

02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
related to the collection of fees for
 
02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
all electronic tolling so there are a
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
couple things that happen here
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
our third shift during covid
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
because the the reduced traffic volumes
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
were so um minimal
 
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
we moved to all electronic tolling
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
during the third shift late at night so
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
that has increased our collections on
 
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
our fees
 
02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
and also in the future year projections
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
dover in rochester will begin
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
all electronic tolling at the end of
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and into fy23
 
02:19:34.399 --> 02:19:35.270 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 and into fy23
so

02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
we see some increased other revenue
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
related to that for the for some
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
increased fees related to all electronic
 
02:19:41.519 --> 02:19:43.429 align:start position:0%
increased fees related to all electronic
tolling

02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
tolling
 
02:19:43.439 --> 02:19:44.790 align:start position:0%
tolling
um

02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
so that's what we have on the turnpike
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
system i don't know if anyone has any
 
02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:49.670 align:start position:0%
system i don't know if anyone has any
questions

02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
on those estimates or anything going on
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
with the turnpike system right now okay
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative romney i mean
 
02:19:59.590 --> 02:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
well it's still up but i do have another
 
02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:02.710 align:start position:0%
well it's still up but i do have another
question

02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
on what happens in all electronic
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
tolling when you don't have a
 
02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:09.429 align:start position:0%
tolling when you don't have a
transponder

02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
transponder
 
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
and you have no intention of getting one
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
because you live a long way away from
 
02:20:12.479 --> 02:20:14.790 align:start position:0%
because you live a long way away from
tolls

02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
tolls
 
02:20:17.670 --> 02:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
i can answer that representative um so
 
02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
we have a couple different options um
 
02:20:20.479 --> 02:20:21.510 align:start position:0%
we have a couple different options um
one

02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
um you can be you can have a license
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
plate account so for example you can go
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
on the system and you can put in your
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
license plate um
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
the make of your car
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the system will be able to marry
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know when you go through the tolls
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
the vehicle with with your account so
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
you can have a license plate account
 
02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
with no transponder um
 
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
you can be if you don't if you don't
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
choose to um
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know set up a license plate account
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
you can actually go through the system
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
and then go online within seven days
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
and pay for the toll you can put in your
 
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
your license plate information your car
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
information the approximate time you
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
went through and then pay for the toll
 
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
that way um
 
02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
if you decide not to do that then
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
um the turnpike system will look up
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
your account information well we'll look
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
up your license plate and then we'll
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
contact our dmv and then send you an
 
02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:22.150 align:start position:0%
contact our dmv and then send you an
invoice

02:21:22.150 --> 02:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
invoice
 
02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh and typically because it's you know a
 
02:21:26.950 --> 02:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
little more work to be able to do that
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
and the postage and all that
 
02:21:28.960 --> 02:21:29.990 align:start position:0%
and the postage and all that
um

02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
will will have an invoicing fee
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
um or a processing fee of a dollar
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
in addition to the toll to cover that
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
cost and that's payable within 30 days
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
um if
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
you the person does not pay with within
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
30 days then they'll get another notice
 
02:21:50.309 --> 02:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
and that fee increases to a dollar fifty
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
to cover that additional postage um in
 
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
addition to the toll so there are
 
02:21:57.429 --> 02:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place to try to uh collect
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
from those individuals obviously we'd
 
02:21:59.040 --> 02:21:59.990 align:start position:0%
from those individuals obviously we'd
love

02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
love
 
02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh for people to have transponders but
 
02:22:04.309 --> 02:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
if they choose not to there are a number
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
of different ways that um they'll be
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
able to pay their toll
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh real quick uh the
 
02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
hooks at rest areas uh common man has
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
the contracts with those
 
02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
the the the fees that they pay go to you
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
you folks
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
are what agency receive those receives
 
02:22:27.190 --> 02:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
yes representatives so that's another
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
good question
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
so um that is actually a 35-year
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
contract that we have um with that group
 
02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:38.070 align:start position:0%
contract that we have um with that group
um

02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:39.429 --> 02:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
that they're called granite state
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
hospitality but it is the common man um
 
02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
aspect um and um you know in essence
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
they pay a minimum amount for um for
 
02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:52.150 align:start position:0%
they pay a minimum amount for um for
rent

02:22:52.150 --> 02:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
rent
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's 500 000 a year for both locations
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that based on sales
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
of food as well as based on sales of
 
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
volume of gas they pay an additional
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
amount um that um they need to break
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
you know certain thresholds of sales in
 
02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
order to have those amounts triggered i
 
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
mean it's you know based on percentages
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's tiered so if they're more
 
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
successful they pay us a higher
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
percentage uh both on the
 
02:23:24.070 --> 02:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
food and convenience store sales as well
 
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
as on the gas sales
 
02:23:29.429 --> 02:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
so before covert hit um i believe they
 
02:23:29.439 --> 02:23:31.429 align:start position:0%
so before covert hit um i believe they
paid

02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
paid
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
a little over 1.1 million
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
um you know for the fiscal year
 
02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:38.070 align:start position:0%
um you know for the fiscal year
um

02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:39.270 align:start position:0%
um
for

02:23:39.270 --> 02:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
their rent as well as food and and and
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
gas sales um so it is a very you know
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
they're they're having quite a bit of
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
success operating those facilities
 
02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
the customers i think um
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
are you know feel the facilities and
 
02:23:57.270 --> 02:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
services are you know uh very very good
 
02:23:58.870 --> 02:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
there and
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
we are getting some revenue that comes
 
02:24:03.910 --> 02:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
back into the turnpike fund um from from
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
those locations so they're very
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
successful in my mind it does yeah i
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
think so too
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
it it goes to the turnpike fund it's
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
what up
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
it goes somewhere in the turnpike fund
 
02:24:16.309 --> 02:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
it goes into the turnpike fund in
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
essence it is um
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
in with all the rest of the revenue and
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know the turnpike revenue
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
is used for
 
02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
operating the system um all the easy
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
pass expenses so that's the that's the
 
02:24:32.469 --> 02:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
operation and maintenance aspect of it
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
um then there is debt service that's
 
02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:35.990 align:start position:0%
um then there is debt service that's
paid

02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
paid
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
then the rnr work that is paid uh to
 
02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
make sure the system is in good working
 
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
order and then everything else flows
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%

02:26:59.830 --> 02:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
can you see it
 
02:27:03.439 --> 02:27:04.710 align:start position:0%
can you see it
no

02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:27:07.349 --> 02:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay i have it on my screen how do i get
 
02:27:10.710 --> 02:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
your name is chris from the lba
 
02:27:14.790 --> 02:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
hi chris
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
you see the share screen on the bottom
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
of the um zoom
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
frame it's in green i think it should be
 
02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
if you click on that it's going to open
 
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
up all the open documents you have on
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
your computer
 
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
and then you can pick the slide that
 
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
you're you want to show the committee
 
02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
and then you got to hit share and i
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
think that'll be in the bottom right
 
02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:46.870 align:start position:0%
think that'll be in the bottom right
side

02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
looks like at work
 
02:27:48.319 --> 02:27:49.270 align:start position:0%
looks like at work
yep

02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:50.950 align:start position:0%
yep
okay

02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%

mason's first time in front of house
 
02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
ways and means and this is my first time
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
presenting as the chief of the business
 
02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:12.870 align:start position:0%
presenting as the chief of the business
division

02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
division
 
02:28:16.550 --> 02:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
um according to christie you are very
 
02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
interested in the unrestricted fish and
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
game fund of course and the fish and
 
02:28:24.389 --> 02:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
game fund ended fiscal year 20 with
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
7.6 million dollars in the unrestricted
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
fish and game fund and that is a very
 
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
good number it's the largest number
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
we've seen in quite a while
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
so per your request i did up this little
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet you had asked for a
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
list of all of our
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
individual parts of unrestricted revenue
 
02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:48.150 align:start position:0%
individual parts of unrestricted revenue
types

02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
types
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 16 through 20 actuals
 
02:28:53.670 --> 02:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
and that's what this
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
worksheet right here represents that is
 
02:28:57.590 --> 02:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
up on your screen
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
and i would be more than happy to go
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
down through all of these different
 
02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
types if that is your pleasure this
 
02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:04.630 align:start position:0%
types if that is your pleasure this
morning

02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
and then this second tab right here
 
02:29:11.349 --> 02:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
represents what i am anticipating for
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
23 and 24 what we budgeted
 
02:29:19.349 --> 02:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
and also what i budgeted for fiscal year
 
02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
21 which is the current budget but
 
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
given that we are
 
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
through halfway through the fiscal year
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
i have changed a couple of those
 
02:29:32.309 --> 02:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
estimates uh as you know interest
 
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
earnings are much lower than what we
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
anticipated a couple years ago when we
 
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
went through the budget process
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
and a couple of these revenues have
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
already come in that would be the ohrv
 
02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
and marine unrefunded road tolls those
 
02:29:49.830 --> 02:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
are actual revenues that have already
 
02:29:52.389 --> 02:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
been deposited into the unrestricted
 
02:29:54.309 --> 02:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
fish and game fund
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
so with all of that being said if you
 
02:29:58.469 --> 02:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
would like i can go down through these
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
different types of revenue sources or
 
02:30:04.309 --> 02:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
answer questions at this point whatever
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
your pleasure is
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
if you would give us a high level of
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
each one of these lines
 
02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:15.190 align:start position:0%
each one of these lines
certainly

02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:17.910 --> 02:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
so the majority of these lines speak for
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
themselves certainly licenses is the
 
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
largest part of our unrestricted
 
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
revenues and that's where all of our
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
license revenue is deposited into when
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
it first hits the department
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
there are some licenses that are
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated license types for an example
 
02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
when you purchase a fishing license
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
as a resident you would pay 44 dollars
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
for that fishing license 43 of that
 
02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
license stays within this unrestricted
 
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
pot and one dollar of that license goes
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
into what we call the fisheries
 
02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:53.910 align:start position:0%
into what we call the fisheries
dedicated

02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
habitat account
 
02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:56.469 align:start position:0%
habitat account
so

02:30:56.469 --> 02:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
that is our unrestricted license account
 
02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
concord agent fees is in statute all
 
02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
licensing agents receive one dollar from
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
the sale of each license type that they
 
02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:09.590 align:start position:0%
the sale of each license type that they
sell

02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
sell
 
02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
so this particular account is for that
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
one dollar agent fee that for all the
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
licenses that are sold here at the
 
02:31:20.830 --> 02:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
2067 is kind of a melting pot
 
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous sales and income and the
 
02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
biggest deposit that actually goes into
 
02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
this account is
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
the internal administrative charge which
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
is charged to seven of our dedicated
 
02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
internal accounts
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
and it's an over
 
02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
overhead charge you might say it's 10 of
 
02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
the revenues that are assessed on those
 
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated accounts
 
02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
for income that is brought in during the
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
and that averages about 250 to 300 000
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
per year it is a one lump sum deposit
 
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
typically done
 
02:32:12.150 --> 02:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
405 448 is court fines and penalties
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
kind of speaks for itself our
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
conservation officers out in the field
 
02:32:22.630 --> 02:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
assess fines on people who are not
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
following our laws
 
02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
and these fines and penalties are sent
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
over to us by the administrative office
 
02:32:34.469 --> 02:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
of the courts on a regular basis
 
02:32:34.479 --> 02:32:35.429 align:start position:0%
of the courts on a regular basis
um

02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
the ohrv agent
 
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
fees are the exact same thing as the
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
carcade agent fees only these are for
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
ohrv agent
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
registrations and
 
02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:48.550 align:start position:0%
registrations and
this

02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
fee was actually just increased this
 
02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to four dollars per
 
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
registration prior to that it was three
 
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
dollars per registration and prior to
 
02:33:00.309 --> 02:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
that it was two dollars
 
02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
and if i go back to the unrestricted
 
02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:04.070 align:start position:0%
and if i go back to the unrestricted
revenue

02:33:04.070 --> 02:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:33:07.190 --> 02:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
16 through 20 you can actually see how
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
it used to be a little bit less and it's
 
02:33:12.309 --> 02:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
gone up a little bit more because that
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
fee has actually increased
 
02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
i and that is all in statute
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
um license license agent fines and
 
02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:23.510 align:start position:0%
um license license agent fines and
penalties

02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
actually is a fee paid by our license
 
02:33:28.630 --> 02:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
agents if their
 
02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
monthly remittance is not remitted by
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
the 14th
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
postmarked excuse me by the 14th
 
02:33:39.590 --> 02:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
day of the month for the prior month
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
sales we have the ability to assess a
 
02:33:42.479 --> 02:33:43.670 align:start position:0%
sales we have the ability to assess a
fine

02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
on that license agent now the license
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
agent actually does have a right to
 
02:33:51.510 --> 02:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
waive ask for a waiver of that fine if
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
they have a
 
02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
a reason and during covid we waived a
 
02:33:59.190 --> 02:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
lot of those fines and fees due to them
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
not having the personnel to be able to
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
submit their
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
monthly reports on time
 
02:34:08.469 --> 02:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
interest earnings
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
speaks for itself right now
 
02:34:15.429 --> 02:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
interest earnings and deposits
 
02:34:19.910 --> 02:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
went way up for 19 and 20 as you can see
 
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
and then i kind of put it way down i had
 
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
budgeted it at 50 and we are
 
02:34:28.469 --> 02:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
significantly down in our interest
 
02:34:28.479 --> 02:34:29.590 align:start position:0%
significantly down in our interest
earnings

02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
earnings
 
02:34:32.950 --> 02:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
treasury actually calculates this based
 
02:34:36.950 --> 02:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
on the fish and game fund component of
 
02:34:38.950 --> 02:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
all of the revenues that are held by
 
02:34:41.270 --> 02:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
treasury within the state
 
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
and as i said interest earnings are way
 
02:34:44.790 --> 02:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
down so i
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
actually did a revised estimate i am not
 
02:34:47.359 --> 02:34:49.030 align:start position:0%
actually did a revised estimate i am not
anticipating

02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
very good
 
02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
income from our interest earnings at
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
this point in time we have received less
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
than two thousand dollars this fiscal
 
02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:58.550 align:start position:0%
than two thousand dollars this fiscal
year

02:34:58.550 --> 02:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
sale of surplus property is proceeds of
 
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
all fish and game equipment that is sent
 
02:35:07.110 --> 02:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
to the department of administrative
 
02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
services surplus
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
and then they
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
sell our surplus property and surplus
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
vehicles is the exact same thing only
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
this is just vehicles fishing game
 
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are sent over there
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
federal recoveries and indirect cost
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
pretty large pot just under a million
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
dollars and this actually is a
 
02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
percentage that is charged to all of our
 
02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
federal grants and federal grants within
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
the department is an average of six to
 
02:35:42.150 --> 02:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
nine million dollars annually
 
02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
and it's a cost to cover all of the
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
administrative overhead within the
 
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
department an administrative overhead is
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
personnel cost within the director's
 
02:35:55.750 --> 02:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
office and the business office
 
02:35:58.710 --> 02:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
and this rate is approved by the u.s
 
02:36:00.550 --> 02:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
fish and wildlife service the
 
02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
methodology to calculate this rate
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
and they are our
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
federal cognizant agencies so we have to
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
go through quite a process to have them
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
approve this rate
 
02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:15.030 align:start position:0%
approve this rate
and

02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:17.110 --> 02:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
our final one here other than the
 
02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
unrefunded road toll is gain management
 
02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:22.230 align:start position:0%
unrefunded road toll is gain management

02:36:22.230 --> 02:36:22.240 align:start position:0%

02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
game management transfers is initially
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
all license revenues are deposited into
 
02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
that top revenue source 5221
 
02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
and after all
 
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
monthly reconciliations
 
02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:36.389 align:start position:0%

02:36:51.270 --> 02:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
are deposited into the dedicated game

in all remaining funds from the sale of
 
02:36:58.950 --> 02:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
those individual permits
 
02:37:01.750 --> 02:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
are transferred into this game

that resides here
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
so that is a high level
 
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
description of what all of these
 
02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:14.469 align:start position:0%
description of what all of these
unrestricted

02:37:14.469 --> 02:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
revenue sources are compiled of
 
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
and do we have any questions from the
 
02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:27.750 align:start position:0%
and do we have any questions from the
committee

02:37:27.750 --> 02:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:35.590 --> 02:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
i can't hear anything representative
 
02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
romney you need to unmute yourself
 
02:37:41.830 --> 02:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry i did it again i just
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
want to know if they're done with the
 
02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
presentation because i have a couple of
 
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
fun questions to ask them yes i am
 
02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh where does the money from uh
 
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
what is it called north county
 
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
country law the animal planet tv show
 
02:37:57.670 --> 02:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
that our uh
 
02:37:58.870 --> 02:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
fish and game
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
wardens are are involved with
 
02:38:02.550 --> 02:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
what is that
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding is they get 2 000 an
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
episode or the state does
 
02:38:08.550 --> 02:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
for this where does that money go
 
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
the two thousand dollars per episode for
 
02:38:15.990 --> 02:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:17.990 --> 02:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
those funds actually do not come to the
 
02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
fish and game department they actually
 
02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
go to our non-profit partner of the
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
wildlife heritage foundation well they
 
02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
do okay yes that's good
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
how about that's question norm
 
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
is the uh
 
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
safe hike
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh cards how's that program doing and
 
02:38:37.030 --> 02:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
where does that money go
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
the pr that program is doing
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
much better than anyone had anticipated
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
actually and those funds are directly
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
deposited into the search and rush
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
rescue account
 
02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:48.550 align:start position:0%
rescue account
so

02:38:48.550 --> 02:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:38:50.469 --> 02:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
those funds are not represented here
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
because those are dedicated funds
 
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
they're dedicated to search and rescue
 
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:02.389 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
representative

02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:04.950 --> 02:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you on it's a little difficult
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
because you've got the 20
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
numbers on one page and the 21 numbers
 
02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
on the next page
 
02:39:15.030 --> 02:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like you're expecting a
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
decline of about 20
 
02:39:20.710 --> 02:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
from the banner year of 20
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
as people
 
02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
and go start to go out again
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
well we
 
02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're being a little conservative
 
02:39:32.389 --> 02:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative elmi we're we're not
 
02:39:34.230 --> 02:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
quite sure with
 
02:39:37.270 --> 02:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
covid and with the vaccine
 
02:39:39.710 --> 02:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
if we're going to
 
02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:41.510 align:start position:0%
if we're going to
experience

02:39:41.510 --> 02:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
the banner year that we did last year
 
02:39:44.960 --> 02:39:46.710 align:start position:0%
the banner year that we did last year
and

02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we we need to be
 
02:39:52.399 --> 02:39:56.469 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we we need to be
conservative

02:39:56.469 --> 02:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
all committee we're not seeing any
 
02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:11.110 align:start position:0%
all committee we're not seeing any
questions

02:40:11.110 --> 02:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:15.910 --> 02:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
do you have anything else to share with
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
the committee at this point in
 
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
time kathy i i do not sir
 
02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:24.230 align:start position:0%
time kathy i i do not sir
okay

02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:40:26.469 --> 02:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
then uh since
 
02:40:29.270 --> 02:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are no other questions we
 
02:40:30.790 --> 02:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank both you
 
02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:32.150 align:start position:0%
thank both you

02:42:55.750 --> 02:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
so to the um do those sessions begin at
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
nine in the morning or ten
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
nine in the morning right nine in the
 
02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:00.710 align:start position:0%
nine in the morning right nine in the
morning

02:43:00.710 --> 02:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:01.590 align:start position:0%
morning
so

02:43:01.590 --> 02:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
i have to testify on the third can i
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
just leave my
 
02:43:08.469 --> 02:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to do that and i have
 
02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
to get back in
 
02:43:11.830 --> 02:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
because i need to use my computer to
 
02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:13.190 align:start position:0%
because i need to use my computer to
testify

02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%

02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
it won't be a problem
 
02:43:33.750 --> 02:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
because you need the same computer
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%

02:44:07.349 --> 02:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
email you sent that we were likely to do
 
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
a work session on the 16th
 
02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:11.269 align:start position:0%
a work session on the 16th
17th

02:44:11.269 --> 02:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
17th
 
02:44:13.590 --> 02:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
yes no the 16th
 
02:44:23.269 --> 02:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:23.279 --> 02:44:26.389 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
i hear that the governor may change the
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
date he presents his budget
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to get that nail down
 
02:44:37.429 --> 02:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
because right after he presents his
 
02:44:39.510 --> 02:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
budget we want to meet with
 
02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
his budget
 
02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:43.990 align:start position:0%
his budget
person

02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:44:49.269 --> 02:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:49.279 --> 02:44:50.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:52.309 --> 02:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
hang tight and we're working on these
 
02:44:52.319 --> 02:44:54.309 align:start position:0%
hang tight and we're working on these
things

02:44:54.309 --> 02:44:54.319 align:start position:0%

02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.240 align:start position:0%

using your computer
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
and you can see if your share screen
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
will work
 
03:51:45.840 --> 03:51:50.070 align:start position:0%
will work
okay

03:51:50.070 --> 03:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:51.590 --> 03:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
if you have enough hands to do all of
 
03:51:51.600 --> 03:51:55.429 align:start position:0%
if you have enough hands to do all of
that

it's not you're getting there i think
 
03:52:27.269 --> 03:52:27.279 align:start position:0%

yeah i'm trying to
 
03:52:43.189 --> 03:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:45.840 --> 03:52:54.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:52:54.469 --> 03:52:54.479 align:start position:0%

03:52:57.680 --> 03:53:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
thing

03:53:01.670 --> 03:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:03.510 --> 03:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
if chris can share it i can work from

03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i can do that
 
03:53:13.750 --> 03:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:17.670 --> 03:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
apologize we do a lot on teams here so
 
03:53:19.590 --> 03:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's a little different on zoom
 
03:53:19.600 --> 03:53:20.870 align:start position:0%
it's a little different on zoom
okay

03:53:20.870 --> 03:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:53:20.880 --> 03:53:22.710 align:start position:0%
okay

oh
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
dana carl is the comptroller from the
 
03:53:27.510 --> 03:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
03:53:30.469 --> 03:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
and she's going to be reporting on
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
other revenue sources okay dana
 
03:53:37.269 --> 03:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon um
 
03:53:38.950 --> 03:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
normally commissioner arlinghaus is with
 
03:53:40.870 --> 03:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
me but he was tied up in another hearing
 
03:53:43.189 --> 03:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
right now so i'm gonna go through it
 
03:53:44.309 --> 03:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
without him
 
03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:53:48.309 --> 03:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
if we want to go to slide two
 
03:53:50.550 --> 03:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
um we could asked for some information
 
03:53:51.910 --> 03:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
about the
 
03:53:53.510 --> 03:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
how the monthly revenue focus is
 
03:53:55.990 --> 03:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
developed and how the
 
03:53:59.429 --> 03:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
revenue plan is developed by our office
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
so i have a few bullets on that
 
03:54:04.150 --> 03:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
if anyone is not on the distribution
 
03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
list for the monthly revenue focus feel
 
03:54:09.510 --> 03:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
free to touch base with jen or chris and
 
03:54:11.670 --> 03:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
they can connect you with my office we
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
do email that out we also post it
 
03:54:17.670 --> 03:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
on our website as is noted here
 
03:54:20.469 --> 03:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
usually it comes in out the first about
 
03:54:23.030 --> 03:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
the second or third business day of each
 
03:54:25.269 --> 03:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
beginning of each month reporting on the
 
03:54:27.510 --> 03:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
cash basis collections from the previous
 
03:54:27.520 --> 03:54:28.950 align:start position:0%
cash basis collections from the previous
months

03:54:28.950 --> 03:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:54:31.030 --> 03:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
this is just reporting on unrestricted
 
03:54:32.870 --> 03:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
revenue sources
 
03:54:35.510 --> 03:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
today my presentation is about the
 
03:54:38.229 --> 03:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
category of other but the monthly
 
03:54:40.870 --> 03:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
revenue focus reports all unrestricted
 
03:54:42.309 --> 03:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
revenue sources
 
03:54:44.229 --> 03:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
including the dra revenue sources
 
03:54:47.590 --> 03:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
business taxes liquor etc
 
03:54:49.510 --> 03:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
so that report you should be familiar
 
03:54:51.750 --> 03:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
with again it's cash basis
 
03:54:53.670 --> 03:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
so there are some
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
annual audit adjustments that take place
 
03:54:57.510 --> 03:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
but it is generally meant to give you a
 
03:54:59.910 --> 03:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
sense each month of how we are doing as
 
03:55:01.830 --> 03:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
compared to plan
 
03:55:03.990 --> 03:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
the second bullet talks about the plan
 
03:55:06.150 --> 03:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
which is put out at the beginning of the
 
03:55:08.710 --> 03:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
each fiscal year and it's based on the
 
03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
adopted budget law so it's really an
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
annual plan
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
and we work with each agency that
 
03:55:17.590 --> 03:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
collects the funds to split it up into
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
monthly increments um based on
 
03:55:23.349 --> 03:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
their track record of collections um and
 
03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
historical patterns
 
03:55:27.990 --> 03:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
that way it gives us a sense of what are
 
03:55:29.910 --> 03:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
the big months versus smaller months
 
03:55:31.830 --> 03:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
especially when it pertains to business
 
03:55:31.840 --> 03:55:33.189 align:start position:0%
especially when it pertains to business
taxes

03:55:33.189 --> 03:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
but there is no actual monthly plan by
 
03:55:39.110 --> 03:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
law it's an annual plan so
 
03:55:41.189 --> 03:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
generally as long as we meet plan for
 
03:55:44.070 --> 03:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year we're in good shape even
 
03:55:45.990 --> 03:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
if we are behind during the course of
 
03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
the year
 
03:55:49.429 --> 03:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
and we talk about that in the focus as
 
03:55:49.439 --> 03:55:50.790 align:start position:0%
and we talk about that in the focus as
well

03:55:50.790 --> 03:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
and then each the plan itself is based
 
03:55:53.359 --> 03:55:54.150 align:start position:0%
and then each the plan itself is based
on

03:55:54.150 --> 03:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:55:56.150 --> 03:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
as i said the adopted budget as well as
 
03:55:57.349 --> 03:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
items that may impact the plan uh
 
03:56:01.830 --> 03:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
schedule two adjustments that sort of
 
03:56:04.229 --> 03:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
thing that come out of typically out of
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
a committee conference
 
03:56:08.309 --> 03:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
anything that is on the
 
03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
lba surplus statement that they produce
 
03:56:13.030 --> 03:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
is what we incorporate um and then
 
03:56:14.630 --> 03:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are things such i
 
03:56:16.469 --> 03:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the last bullet
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
where an item we don't change the plan
 
03:56:20.950 --> 03:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
if we're no if we're aware of something
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to impact the actual
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
revenues collected
 
03:56:27.030 --> 03:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
we might footnote it in the plan for
 
03:56:27.040 --> 03:56:28.309 align:start position:0%
we might footnote it in the plan for
instance

03:56:28.309 --> 03:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
instance
 
03:56:29.830 --> 03:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
this past year was
 
03:56:31.910 --> 03:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
liquor had a larger
 
03:56:33.830 --> 03:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
distribution to the alcohol abuse fund
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
so we've been noting that throughout the
 
03:56:35.279 --> 03:56:36.469 align:start position:0%
so we've been noting that throughout the
year

03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't impact the actual adopted
 
03:56:40.630 --> 03:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
budgeted plan it just is something
 
03:56:40.640 --> 03:56:42.070 align:start position:0%
budgeted plan it just is something
noteworthy

03:56:42.070 --> 03:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
noteworthy
 
03:56:44.070 --> 03:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
that we draw attention to if we if we're
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
aware of something that comes about
 
03:56:46.080 --> 03:56:46.950 align:start position:0%
aware of something that comes about
through

03:56:46.950 --> 03:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:56:51.590 --> 03:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
other legislation or other enacted items
 
03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
so i can take any questions on that or
 
03:56:57.510 --> 03:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:03.830 --> 03:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh there's no questions at this point in
 
03:57:03.840 --> 03:57:05.110 align:start position:0%
uh there's no questions at this point in
time

03:57:05.110 --> 03:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:57:05.120 --> 03:57:09.189 align:start position:0%
time
okay

03:57:09.189 --> 03:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:11.670 --> 03:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned um the
 
03:57:13.269 --> 03:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
while we do
 
03:57:15.030 --> 03:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
as in the accounting function for the
 
03:57:16.950 --> 03:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
state track all unrestricted revenue
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
sources um here in das we as far as
 
03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
budgetary estimates we handle the
 
03:57:25.830 --> 03:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
category of other
 
03:57:27.510 --> 03:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of things are in there you'll see
 
03:57:30.070 --> 03:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
further in the presentation
 
03:57:32.229 --> 03:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
at some points there's been 200 revenue
 
03:57:34.309 --> 03:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
sources there's about 140 right now
 
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
active revenue sources that roll up into
 
03:57:36.800 --> 03:57:38.070 align:start position:0%
active revenue sources that roll up into
other

03:57:38.070 --> 03:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:57:39.990 --> 03:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll talk today about some of the
 
03:57:41.670 --> 03:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
more sizable ones
 
03:57:44.229 --> 03:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
again most of these are not collected by
 
03:57:46.710 --> 03:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
admin services but we do
 
03:57:49.590 --> 03:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
report on them all and try to do any the
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
best estimating that we can of the group
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
03:57:54.229 --> 03:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
the two that we do
 
03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
calculate and collect are the
 
03:57:58.309 --> 03:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for statewide indirect
 
03:58:01.189 --> 03:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
costs which is also known as ycap
 
03:58:02.790 --> 03:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
and then also the recovery for
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
post-retirement benefits and i'll talk a
 
03:58:06.870 --> 03:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
little about those on the next slide but
 
03:58:10.389 --> 03:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
those are both calculated by my office
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
and we handle the billion collections
 
03:58:14.950 --> 03:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
with the internal state agencies on
 
03:58:14.960 --> 03:58:17.030 align:start position:0%
with the internal state agencies on
those

03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:58:20.389 --> 03:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
most of the others are external revenue
 
03:58:20.399 --> 03:58:21.429 align:start position:0%
most of the others are external revenue
sources

03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
sources
 
03:58:23.030 --> 03:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue sources that
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
support other agencies operations
 
03:58:28.710 --> 03:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
so the two mentioned that are typically
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
fairly large in this category or
 
03:58:32.309 --> 03:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
interest in abandoned property and i
 
03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
know treasury is up next after me so i'm
 
03:58:39.269 --> 03:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
not going to get too deep into that
 
03:58:41.269 --> 03:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
and then there's a few
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned here from department of safety
 
03:58:45.189 --> 03:58:45.199 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
03:58:47.269 --> 03:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
and then a whole slew of miscellaneous
 
03:58:47.279 --> 03:58:48.150 align:start position:0%
and then a whole slew of miscellaneous
other

03:58:48.150 --> 03:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:58:50.070 --> 03:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
so if you want to go to the next
 
03:58:50.080 --> 03:58:52.469 align:start position:0%
so if you want to go to the next
page

03:58:52.469 --> 03:58:52.479 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:58:54.870 --> 03:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
we can talk about the couple that are
 
03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
collected here in admin services
 
03:58:59.910 --> 03:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
because we're the central service agency
 
03:58:59.920 --> 03:59:01.110 align:start position:0%
because we're the central service agency
we

03:59:01.110 --> 03:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
do the calculation to
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
what those costs are each year and we
 
03:59:07.269 --> 03:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
get that
 
03:59:10.309 --> 03:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
cost recovery rate is approved by the
 
03:59:13.590 --> 03:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
federal government and we bill and
 
03:59:15.990 --> 03:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
collect with agencies
 
03:59:18.630 --> 03:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
there are some timing differences that
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
the overall the category of other is is
 
03:59:28.790 --> 03:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
significantly a variable type of
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
category it is difficult to have actual
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
trend analysis on any of these line
 
03:59:33.120 --> 03:59:34.950 align:start position:0%
trend analysis on any of these line
items

03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
items
 
03:59:36.870 --> 03:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
indirect costs in particular
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
as well as post retirement
 
03:59:40.710 --> 03:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
they do tend to
 
03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
vary from year to year based on a very
 
03:59:46.150 --> 03:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
detailed and intricate calculation
 
03:59:47.990 --> 03:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
that i won't go into here but we work
 
03:59:50.070 --> 03:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
with the agencies to budget and collect
 
03:59:51.750 --> 03:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
and that basically allows us to
 
03:59:58.150 --> 03:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
tap into federal revenue sources to help
 
04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
recover the costs
 
04:00:02.150 --> 04:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
of some things that are in the in the
 
04:00:03.510 --> 04:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
so it comes into the unrestricted
 
04:00:07.269 --> 04:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
general fund revenue
 
04:00:08.870 --> 04:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
to offset
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
other general funded expenses
 
04:00:13.990 --> 04:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
and the funding sources for federal
 
04:00:15.910 --> 04:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
grants and such
 
04:00:17.429 --> 04:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
04:00:17.439 --> 04:00:20.070 align:start position:0%
for the most part
so

04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:21.990 --> 04:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
if we want to go on to the next slide
 
04:00:24.229 --> 04:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
i'll talk quickly about post retirement
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
and then we'll talk about the numbers
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
so post retirement is very similar it is
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
collecting recovery
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
from federal grants and
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
non-generally funded revenue sources to
 
04:00:40.229 --> 04:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
support the costs of
 
04:00:42.550 --> 04:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
retiree health benefits that
 
04:00:44.150 --> 04:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
are funded through the general fund
 
04:00:44.160 --> 04:00:45.510 align:start position:0%
are funded through the general fund
budget

04:00:45.510 --> 04:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:00:47.349 --> 04:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
so that we have a we also have a
 
04:00:48.870 --> 04:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
calculated rate
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
each year and we charge the agencies
 
04:00:54.550 --> 04:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
for that cost recovery
 
04:00:56.309 --> 04:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
so on the next slide we can talk a
 
04:00:58.229 --> 04:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
little bit about the magnitude of these
 
04:00:58.239 --> 04:00:59.830 align:start position:0%
little bit about the magnitude of these
dollars

04:00:59.830 --> 04:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:01:03.429 --> 04:01:03.439 align:start position:0%
this is a history back to fiscal 16 of
 
04:01:03.439 --> 04:01:05.590 align:start position:0%
this is a history back to fiscal 16 of
actuals

04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
actuals
 
04:01:07.269 --> 04:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
i'll skip over miscellaneous for a
 
04:01:09.990 --> 04:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
moment but the second line second and
 
04:01:12.469 --> 04:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
third line is the reimbursement of
 
04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
indirect costs and post-retirement which
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
we just discussed
 
04:01:17.750 --> 04:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
as you can see
 
04:01:20.150 --> 04:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
they're fairly close each year but there
 
04:01:23.269 --> 04:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
are some significant years where just
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
change in the budgetary rate in the way
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
it is calculated
 
04:01:30.790 --> 04:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
from a timing perspective that can
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
change also sometimes it's affected by
 
04:01:35.750 --> 04:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
when the agency actually pays
 
04:01:37.670 --> 04:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
so we may put a bill out and then there
 
04:01:39.030 --> 04:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
may be cross
 
04:01:39.040 --> 04:01:40.150 align:start position:0%
may be cross
payment

04:01:40.150 --> 04:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
payment
 
04:01:42.710 --> 04:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
across different fiscal periods and this
 
04:01:46.710 --> 04:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
is all cash basis numbers here so
 
04:01:47.750 --> 04:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
we can
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
give you a sense that it does vary from
 
04:01:52.790 --> 04:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
year to year but it's order of magnitude
 
04:01:54.710 --> 04:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
it can be
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat similar so we've budgeted we've
 
04:02:00.229 --> 04:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
shown you our projected budget for this
 
04:02:02.790 --> 04:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year that we're in 21 as well as
 
04:02:04.950 --> 04:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
22 and 23
 
04:02:07.349 --> 04:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
just based on what we think that we're
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
going to end up billing the agencies for
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
so the top two are the most significant
 
04:02:18.389 --> 04:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
um just moving back up to the first line
 
04:02:20.070 --> 04:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
the miscellaneous other revenue that's
 
04:02:22.870 --> 04:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
the 140 or so
 
04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
varied sources that i discussed
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
throughout our uh
 
04:02:30.150 --> 04:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
when we move to the next slide i'll show
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
you some of those but some of those we
 
04:02:34.229 --> 04:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
track individually and some of them we
 
04:02:36.070 --> 04:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't really track because they're just
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
so small
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
so the rest of this slide is
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
really what treasury's going to get into
 
04:02:45.189 --> 04:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
but i can pause here and take any
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
questions on the numbers if you have any
 
04:02:48.399 --> 04:02:49.189 align:start position:0%
questions on the numbers if you have any
uh

04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:52.389 --> 04:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
any questions representative brownie
 
04:02:54.630 --> 04:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation um
 
04:02:57.349 --> 04:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your presentation uh i i
 
04:02:59.429 --> 04:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
always get confused on this one
 
04:03:01.510 --> 04:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
so on the on the reimbursement of
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
indirect costs
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
so to an agency this is an expense
 
04:03:08.309 --> 04:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
to you
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh you your your agency uh you it's a
 
04:03:13.510 --> 04:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's a revenue
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
but i'm trying to reconcile how is it a
 
04:03:17.830 --> 04:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
really a new revenue
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
um i mean the agencies are being paid
 
04:03:23.349 --> 04:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
so the money that's coming in from other
 
04:03:23.359 --> 04:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
so the money that's coming in from other
revenues

04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
are budgeted to them
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
and then they're they're sending some of
 
04:03:31.189 --> 04:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
it to you so are we double counting
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
revenues here
 
04:03:34.950 --> 04:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
no because it's a it's the source of the
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
revenue so
 
04:03:39.110 --> 04:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're uh having agencies charge back
 
04:03:40.710 --> 04:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
through their grant process they're
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
charging their federal counterparts
 
04:03:45.510 --> 04:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
for a recovery
 
04:03:48.309 --> 04:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
of items like for instance central
 
04:03:50.950 --> 04:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
accounting and central financial data
 
04:03:52.469 --> 04:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
management those are all central
 
04:03:53.990 --> 04:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
services that are budgeted in the
 
04:03:55.189 --> 04:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
so we're recovering the costs that
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
everyone is benefiting from
 
04:04:01.349 --> 04:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
from the federal
 
04:04:04.469 --> 04:04:04.479 align:start position:0%
source funds non-general source funds so
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's sort of moving federal funds into
 
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
unrestricted general funds which
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
supports the costs of those
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
cost centers that are
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
budgeted only in the general fund okay
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
if this didn't happen
 
04:04:19.750 --> 04:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it makes a lot of sense okay i
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that i always get a
 
04:04:23.910 --> 04:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
little confused on that one but i i see
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're saying thank
 
04:04:27.510 --> 04:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
you uh yeah it is it is somewhat
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
confusing because yes you will see it in
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
the budget as we mentioned in the
 
04:04:33.990 --> 04:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
presentation it's in the it's in a class
 
04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
in the detailed budget for each agency
 
04:04:36.640 --> 04:04:37.429 align:start position:0%
in the detailed budget for each agency
so

04:04:37.429 --> 04:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:39.510 --> 04:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
um you know if you go to the
 
04:04:41.110 --> 04:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
department of transportation budget and
 
04:04:42.710 --> 04:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
you see a class line
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
for what we call swag cap or indirect
 
04:04:47.910 --> 04:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
cost recovery it is an expense to them
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
but they're
 
04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
getting that from their grant funding
 
04:04:53.269 --> 04:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
all right uh mr chair just wanna follow
 
04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
up on that
 
04:04:56.469 --> 04:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:04:58.469 --> 04:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
just follow okay thank you um
 
04:05:00.309 --> 04:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
so without that this is just a process
 
04:05:01.830 --> 04:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's in place to make it easier for
 
04:05:01.840 --> 04:05:03.189 align:start position:0%
that's in place to make it easier for
this

04:05:03.189 --> 04:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:05:04.630 --> 04:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
instead of each agency having to worry
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
about dealing with the feds to get their
 
04:05:09.750 --> 04:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
payments you you folks handle it is that
 
04:05:09.760 --> 04:05:10.790 align:start position:0%
payments you you folks handle it is that
it

04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:05:13.269 --> 04:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
yeah and it and i just it's a
 
04:05:16.950 --> 04:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
das collects the ricotta recovery but it
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
does not go back into our admin services
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
budget so i guess that's why some people
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
get confused and they're like why am i
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
paying admin services for this
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
it's not going it's going to the state's
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
bottom line so it's going to the general
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
fund unrestricted revenue to support all
 
04:05:36.070 --> 04:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
generally funded costs but
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
but yeah it is it is better to do it
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
from a central standpoint and the
 
04:05:39.600 --> 04:05:41.429 align:start position:0%
from a central standpoint and the
federal

04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
the federal cognizant agency that we
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
work with approves our calculation and
 
04:05:48.309 --> 04:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
the rate that we charge the agencies
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
so there's oversight
 
04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
i understand thank you very much
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:57.120 --> 04:05:58.389 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:01.110 --> 04:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
this this goes back to the monthly
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
revenue focus
 
04:06:04.710 --> 04:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
report and uh
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
and uh the uh as
 
04:06:09.750 --> 04:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly you know the dra
 
04:06:12.150 --> 04:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh collected quite a lot of money in
 
04:06:12.160 --> 04:06:13.349 align:start position:0%
uh collected quite a lot of money in
july

04:06:13.349 --> 04:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
july
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
that the kafir has charged to the prior
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
prior year
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and
 
04:06:22.630 --> 04:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
my question is exactly how is that
 
04:06:22.640 --> 04:06:23.830 align:start position:0%
my question is exactly how is that
showing

04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
showing
 
04:06:25.349 --> 04:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
focus for this year the your reports for
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
this year
 
04:06:31.670 --> 04:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
have you removed that amount of money
 
04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
so that when we look at the dra
 
04:06:37.510 --> 04:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
total for the end of let's say the six
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
month period
 
04:06:42.070 --> 04:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
that total will be without
 
04:06:42.080 --> 04:06:43.189 align:start position:0%
that total will be without
the

04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
roughly 30 million dollars i think
 
04:06:48.229 --> 04:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
yes we do we are carrying that
 
04:06:50.229 --> 04:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
adjustment each month on the
 
04:06:52.630 --> 04:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
year-to-date analysis so
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
not on the m it wouldn't affect the
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
month to month analysis but on the
 
04:06:59.189 --> 04:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
year-to-date page which is page three of
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
our focus
 
04:07:02.950 --> 04:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
we do have a line at the bottom
 
04:07:02.960 --> 04:07:04.150 align:start position:0%
we do have a line at the bottom
that

04:07:04.150 --> 04:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
shows the cash basis collections
 
04:07:08.070 --> 04:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
year-to-date and then removes that 30
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
million to show
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
what you can consider to be
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
available for fy21 so we do carry that
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
adjustment it's uh it's unusual we don't
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
normally because it is a cash basis
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
report it is meant to be cash basis and
 
04:07:25.990 --> 04:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
and we do make accrual adjustments every
 
04:07:29.030 --> 04:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
year um so it's not unusual to have
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
accruals that we reverse out of prior
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
and add in a new year that is that
 
04:07:36.070 --> 04:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
happens every year but this year because
 
04:07:38.710 --> 04:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
of that timing aspect we reversed out
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
last year's accruals but then added
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
a whole lot more to the new year so it
 
04:07:46.550 --> 04:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
really kind of swayed
 
04:07:49.670 --> 04:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
the comparison across the two years so
 
04:07:51.670 --> 04:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
we have been carrying that adjustment
 
04:07:54.070 --> 04:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
and footnote language trying to explain
 
04:08:03.189 --> 04:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:05.160 --> 04:08:05.170 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
04:08:05.170 --> 04:08:06.670 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
[Music]

04:08:06.670 --> 04:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:08:09.189 --> 04:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
post-retirement benefits recovery can
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
you take us through why it swoops up 19
 
04:08:14.950 --> 04:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
to 20 and then
 
04:08:17.110 --> 04:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
then you think it's going to
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
be half
 
04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
in 21 and then
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
good question
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
it is it's a complicated calculation
 
04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
i have a whole
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
unit within my division that
 
04:08:35.590 --> 04:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's not 100 of what they do but
 
04:08:38.150 --> 04:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's a good chunk of what they do
 
04:08:42.150 --> 04:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
each year and it is impacted by
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
payroll costs and
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
timing differences between the years
 
04:08:47.279 --> 04:08:48.469 align:start position:0%
timing differences between the years
so

04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's a little difficult to explain
 
04:08:54.309 --> 04:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what the dip is we we felt that
 
04:08:56.469 --> 04:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
it was sort of
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
more of a temporary type of thing
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
an adjustment if you will but it does it
 
04:09:04.469 --> 04:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
does generally
 
04:09:06.389 --> 04:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
fall somewhat in line
 
04:09:07.510 --> 04:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
each year
 
04:09:09.349 --> 04:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
i think but some of it is like i said
 
04:09:12.550 --> 04:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
affected with timing of collections
 
04:09:14.950 --> 04:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes we can't necessarily control
 
04:09:14.960 --> 04:09:15.830 align:start position:0%
sometimes we can't necessarily control
when

04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
the agency pays in for that item
 
04:09:21.189 --> 04:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
so a lot of it is is really related to
 
04:09:21.199 --> 04:09:22.309 align:start position:0%
so a lot of it is is really related to
timing

04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
timing
 
04:09:24.070 --> 04:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
and we're hoping that in the next couple
 
04:09:27.030 --> 04:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
years it smooths out
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
but i don't i don't have a great answer
 
04:09:31.110 --> 04:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
because there are so many different
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
elements of the calculation that go into
 
04:09:35.349 --> 04:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
it um
 
04:09:38.070 --> 04:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps i can have my team put together
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
a more detailed analysis that we could
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
provide to the committee
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
after your meeting and and try to handle
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
it that way but it is it is somewhat of
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:53.189 --> 04:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you that would be great to have
 
04:09:56.790 --> 04:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
some kind of idea of what that is
 
04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
yeah we do we do some um some analysis
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
for chairman for commissioner ollie
 
04:10:06.389 --> 04:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
house and and try to help him understand
 
04:10:08.790 --> 04:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
um the year to year fluctuation in that
 
04:10:10.950 --> 04:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
so i will get something to the committee
 
04:10:12.150 --> 04:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
that hopefully
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
provides some additional details
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see any so you can
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
you can continue
 
04:10:26.790 --> 04:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
okay i think we'll go on to the next
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
slide which is
 
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
like i said a little bit more detail in
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
the line items that make up the
 
04:10:35.590 --> 04:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous portion
 
04:10:39.030 --> 04:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
um so again this top section of this
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
chart is what we call the tracked
 
04:10:40.640 --> 04:10:41.670 align:start position:0%
chart is what we call the tracked
accounts

04:10:41.670 --> 04:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh where we track each month we we
 
04:10:47.269 --> 04:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
actually allocate a monthly plan
 
04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
estimate and we track each month how
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
they're coming in
 
04:10:52.469 --> 04:10:52.479 align:start position:0%
and then sort of
 
04:10:54.950 --> 04:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
i apologize the numbers didn't show up
 
04:10:56.309 --> 04:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
on the cell when i put it into the
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
powerpoint but uh sort of down down
 
04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom there's a line that
 
04:11:04.229 --> 04:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
says um all others untracked uh it's
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
about seven million dollars for the 2223
 
04:11:07.439 --> 04:11:08.309 align:start position:0%
about seven million dollars for the 2223
year

04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:11:10.229 --> 04:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
those those are
 
04:11:11.790 --> 04:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
130 or so items that come in to to all
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
different agencies for unrestricted
 
04:11:19.750 --> 04:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
revenue sources
 
04:11:22.229 --> 04:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
so a lot of a lot of little things but
 
04:11:24.309 --> 04:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
over the years we've tried to track the
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
bigger line items
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
in here and
 
04:11:29.830 --> 04:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes the
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
trends change if something
 
04:11:34.630 --> 04:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
moves from restricted to unrestricted so
 
04:11:34.640 --> 04:11:35.429 align:start position:0%
moves from restricted to unrestricted so
that

04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
a law may
 
04:11:39.269 --> 04:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
change a particular revenue source where
 
04:11:41.110 --> 04:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
it used to be unrestricted and then it
 
04:11:43.030 --> 04:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
gets changed to restricted
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:50.070 --> 04:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
i guess the only the recent change
 
04:11:53.110 --> 04:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
is is in the uh oplc
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
board fees we had those all moved into
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
restricted so we no longer track those
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
section um that showed up on a previous
 
04:12:01.600 --> 04:12:03.830 align:start position:0%
section um that showed up on a previous
slide

04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
slide
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
but otherwise most everything here
 
04:12:11.670 --> 04:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
is somewhat consistent year over year
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned treasury will talk about
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
interest there they're showing down at
 
04:12:16.870 --> 04:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom that they don't expect to
 
04:12:20.070 --> 04:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
collect any so you'll see in the uh
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
column that says 21 variants from plan
 
04:12:26.150 --> 04:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
um i i'm expecting at this point we're
 
04:12:28.630 --> 04:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
halfway through fiscal 21 i expect to be
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
about seven million dollars
 
04:12:35.429 --> 04:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
short of our plan which was 71.8 million
 
04:12:38.950 --> 04:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
so we expect to collect about 64.8
 
04:12:41.670 --> 04:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
on that plan for fy21
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
for a variety of items but primarily due
 
04:12:45.910 --> 04:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
to interest
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
and then we expect 22 and 23 to come
 
04:12:55.349 --> 04:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
where some come somewhat in line with 68
 
04:12:57.750 --> 04:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
to 70 million dollars overall
 
04:12:59.590 --> 04:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
typically if we're short in one line
 
04:13:02.469 --> 04:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
item we may be over in another and it
 
04:13:04.950 --> 04:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
evens out to about 68 to 70 million
 
04:13:10.229 --> 04:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:15.429 --> 04:13:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative susan amy
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:13:21.520 --> 04:13:22.389 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
uh

04:13:22.389 --> 04:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:24.950 --> 04:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
dana do you have in here the initial
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
plate fund and vanity plate
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
which safety also talked to us about it
 
04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear in two places does it
 
04:13:35.670 --> 04:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
correct they they collect it we report
 
04:13:35.680 --> 04:13:36.389 align:start position:0%
correct they they collect it we report
it

04:13:36.389 --> 04:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
so all of these items uh the vast
 
04:13:41.910 --> 04:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
majority like i said of other is
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
collected by the agencies themselves
 
04:13:44.800 --> 04:13:46.309 align:start position:0%
collected by the agencies themselves
um

04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
we did not for for this exercise um a
 
04:13:50.640 --> 04:13:52.309 align:start position:0%
we did not for for this exercise um a
mid-year

04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
mid-year
 
04:13:55.590 --> 04:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
budget checkup for fy21 um we don't
 
04:13:55.600 --> 04:13:57.990 align:start position:0%
budget checkup for fy21 um we don't
typically

04:13:57.990 --> 04:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
typically
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
go back out and
 
04:14:01.510 --> 04:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
check with every agency to see where
 
04:14:03.510 --> 04:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing we we just kind of track
 
04:14:05.670 --> 04:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
it globally so
 
04:14:06.950 --> 04:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
we can always
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
make adjustments if needed um if safety
 
04:14:11.590 --> 04:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
if there were going to be a big change
 
04:14:13.830 --> 04:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
in the line item we would footnote it
 
04:14:15.910 --> 04:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
and like i mentioned we would we would
 
04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
hope to be over in some other line i'm
 
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
so that at the end of the day as a group
 
04:14:22.149 --> 04:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh they
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
balance out but
 
04:14:26.229 --> 04:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
but yeah safety would be the best source
 
04:14:28.550 --> 04:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
of any information on that item going
 
04:14:30.550 --> 04:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
into the future
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
right and they did take that one down a
 
04:14:35.670 --> 04:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
fair amount because there haven't been
 
04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
very many initial plates
 
04:14:38.960 --> 04:14:39.830 align:start position:0%
very many initial plates
okay

04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:14:42.070 --> 04:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we would probably we didn't make
 
04:14:43.750 --> 04:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
any major adjustments
 
04:14:45.750 --> 04:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
other than treasury
 
04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
for this particular
 
04:14:47.520 --> 04:14:48.830 align:start position:0%
for this particular
estimating

04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
estimating
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
process but again that is because for
 
04:14:54.149 --> 04:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
the most part we usually come in
 
04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.830 --> 04:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
but that's good to know
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
the next four slides i don't have a lot
 
04:15:17.189 --> 04:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
to speak to again these are just to give
 
04:15:18.550 --> 04:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
you a sense
 
04:15:21.670 --> 04:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
of the variety of items that roll up
 
04:15:24.149 --> 04:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
into unrestricted other
 
04:15:26.229 --> 04:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
the shaded ones are the ones that we
 
04:15:29.030 --> 04:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
track and then all of the others
 
04:15:33.110 --> 04:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
we just report on as they come in
 
04:15:33.120 --> 04:15:35.750 align:start position:0%
we just report on as they come in
so

04:15:35.750 --> 04:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
i think i covered most of the items you
 
04:15:40.630 --> 04:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to discuss but
 
04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
i can certainly
 
04:15:47.110 --> 04:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
elaborate on anything else
 
04:15:47.120 --> 04:15:48.790 align:start position:0%
elaborate on anything else
um

04:15:48.790 --> 04:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative romney you have a
 
04:15:50.159 --> 04:15:52.870 align:start position:0%
representative romney you have a
question

04:15:52.870 --> 04:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:54.149 --> 04:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
you're muted
 
04:15:54.159 --> 04:15:57.349 align:start position:0%
you're muted
pat

04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:00.550 --> 04:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks uh norm uh so these all go
 
04:16:02.870 --> 04:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
into general fund correct
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
or is that the education fund
 
04:16:07.110 --> 04:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
no uh
 
04:16:07.120 --> 04:16:08.550 align:start position:0%
no uh
she

04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
she
 
04:16:10.149 --> 04:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i think they
 
04:16:10.159 --> 04:16:11.429 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i think they
believe

04:16:11.429 --> 04:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
they are all general funds we don't
 
04:16:15.030 --> 04:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
typically have a lot of other in the
 
04:16:16.950 --> 04:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund maybe some interest
 
04:16:20.550 --> 04:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
but these are all general okay thank you
 
04:16:23.189 --> 04:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:23.199 --> 04:16:25.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:16:25.510 --> 04:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:16:26.710 --> 04:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
could you tell us uh how you decide
 
04:16:32.309 --> 04:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
which ones to track i notice you've got
 
04:16:34.630 --> 04:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
agriculture economic poisons as a
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
trackable item and i
 
04:16:39.670 --> 04:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
don't remember that one being much
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's just been based on highest
 
04:16:43.750 --> 04:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
dollar value but
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
you're you're correct some may some may
 
04:16:47.349 --> 04:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
shift over the years
 
04:16:49.590 --> 04:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
that one
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah back on chris moved up back to that
 
04:16:56.070 --> 04:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
slide that one's about a million and a
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
half um
 
04:17:00.630 --> 04:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
so i think that i think
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
most of these are just have been
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
historical tract items we i personally
 
04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the time i've been here haven't done
 
04:17:09.189 --> 04:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of adjusting to this other than
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
removing things that don't
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
apply anymore
 
04:17:12.960 --> 04:17:14.469 align:start position:0%
apply anymore
so

04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:16.149 --> 04:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
we can do we can certainly take a look
 
04:17:17.830 --> 04:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
at some of the other and see if any have
 
04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
risen to the levels of being say over a
 
04:17:22.630 --> 04:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars or so but
 
04:17:23.670 --> 04:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
generally these have been the
 
04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i can see that the gas fitters
 
04:17:33.189 --> 04:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
are down to half a million
 
04:17:35.189 --> 04:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
an aircraft
 
04:17:38.950 --> 04:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah they're most you know most revenue
 
04:17:44.309 --> 04:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
sources have a a purpose in them so
 
04:17:44.319 --> 04:17:45.269 align:start position:0%
sources have a a purpose in them so
they're

04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:17:47.910 --> 04:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
usually restricted so that there's not a
 
04:17:47.920 --> 04:17:49.750 align:start position:0%
usually restricted so that there's not a
lot

04:17:49.750 --> 04:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
lot
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know that you want to
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
have a lot in miscellaneous other
 
04:17:56.229 --> 04:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
that's not usually the goal so
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
this is just kind of the place for
 
04:17:59.590 --> 04:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
things that don't have a specific
 
04:17:59.600 --> 04:18:05.269 align:start position:0%
things that don't have a specific
purpose

04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:10.389 --> 04:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:13.830 --> 04:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you norm um yeah uh another
 
04:18:18.389 --> 04:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
question here um i noticed on the one of
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
the early slides office of professional
 
04:18:20.800 --> 04:18:22.389 align:start position:0%
the early slides office of professional
licensure

04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
04:18:24.550 --> 04:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh that we've done work with in the past
 
04:18:26.550 --> 04:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh but i guess the statute change and i
 
04:18:27.990 --> 04:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
we must admit at least i must have
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
missed it that it's
 
04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
now dedicated fund those monies
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
starting in uh ninth fiscal year 19
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
and uh but would you were you around
 
04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
then when that happened and what was the
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
logic of that happening
 
04:18:44.229 --> 04:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
i was around i'm wondering if christie
 
04:18:47.510 --> 04:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
has a little bit more logic but i
 
04:18:50.070 --> 04:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
i do know it it uh
 
04:18:52.790 --> 04:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
it generated a lot of discussion
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and there was times when they
 
04:18:57.030 --> 04:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know they couldn't
 
04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
basically by not including it in the
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
general fund they they changed the way
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
they budgeted for those so there was a
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion i don't know if chris
 
04:19:08.309 --> 04:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
wants to chime in on any of the
 
04:19:08.319 --> 04:19:10.309 align:start position:0%
wants to chime in on any of the
particulars

04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
particulars
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
i don't really have a lot to add um that
 
04:19:16.149 --> 04:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
was a separate bill that went through
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
basically the idea of the bill was that
 
04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
they'd collect all their fees they'd
 
04:19:22.149 --> 04:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
have a budget that they would pay
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
using those fees and anything left at
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
the end of the year
 
04:19:26.870 --> 04:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
would transfer back into the general
 
04:19:26.880 --> 04:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
would transfer back into the general
fund

04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
okay so the agency has has had a number
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
of um
 
04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
directors over the years and and i know
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
they're still trying to
 
04:19:34.720 --> 04:19:36.309 align:start position:0%
they're still trying to
um

04:19:36.309 --> 04:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:38.309 --> 04:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
basically organize themselves so that
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
their laws are all clear as to who sets
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
fees and how fees get set
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think there's a bill that's going to
 
04:19:45.110 --> 04:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
come out this year that's further
 
04:19:46.950 --> 04:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
cleaning up some of their language so i
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
think it was an effort to try to get
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
everything in the same bucket so that
 
04:19:51.590 --> 04:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
you had a good idea of how much was
 
04:19:51.600 --> 04:19:53.030 align:start position:0%
you had a good idea of how much was
collected

04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
collected
 
04:19:54.389 --> 04:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
so that when they were budgeting you
 
04:19:56.389 --> 04:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
could say yeah this is how much you have
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's an appropriate amount to to put
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
in a budget
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
i think representative remember you know
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
a bunch of years ago we spent a lot of
 
04:20:04.319 --> 04:20:05.269 align:start position:0%
a bunch of years ago we spent a lot of
time

04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
setting those fee levels um for these
 
04:20:09.510 --> 04:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
and this must have been come dissent it
 
04:20:10.950 --> 04:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
was a senate bill it looks like senate
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
bill uh 531
 
04:20:15.990 --> 04:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh in 2018
 
04:20:18.389 --> 04:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
um i just don't remember this um
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
happening it could have been one of
 
04:20:20.550 --> 04:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
those bills that was buried in the
 
04:20:22.149 --> 04:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
budget i don't know
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
um but i don't know represent major or
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
mr representative army do you remember
 
04:20:27.110 --> 04:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
this happening
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
on i worked on it quite a lot if that's
 
04:20:33.990 --> 04:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.149 --> 04:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
well right you worked on with me we all
 
04:20:38.550 --> 04:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
worked on this right no i worked on this
 
04:20:42.070 --> 04:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
last year oh okay okay i will uh let you
 
04:20:43.830 --> 04:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
chime in then
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'll back i'm almost at that
 
04:20:45.600 --> 04:20:46.550 align:start position:0%
i'll back i'm almost at that
major

04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
major
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
go ahead reps around
 
04:20:49.590 --> 04:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:49.600 --> 04:20:50.469 align:start position:0%
thank you
on

04:20:50.469 --> 04:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:20:53.349 --> 04:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
this bill on the bill yeah it was a
 
04:20:55.990 --> 04:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill i jammed it through
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
at the last minute the couple of years
 
04:20:58.399 --> 04:20:59.269 align:start position:0%
at the last minute the couple of years
ago

04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
and i was pretty skeptical of it because
 
04:21:04.229 --> 04:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
we'd worked so hard on this and they had
 
04:21:06.149 --> 04:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
not gone through ways and means they
 
04:21:08.950 --> 04:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
only went through i think it was edna
 
04:21:08.960 --> 04:21:10.950 align:start position:0%
only went through i think it was edna
and

04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:10.960 --> 04:21:12.149 align:start position:0%
and
they

04:21:12.149 --> 04:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
they did have terrible trouble at the
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
beginning they went through three
 
04:21:19.030 --> 04:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
directors their new director seems
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
extremely competent
 
04:21:21.439 --> 04:21:22.550 align:start position:0%
extremely competent
and

04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:22.560 --> 04:21:23.510 align:start position:0%
and
on

04:21:23.510 --> 04:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:21:28.149 --> 04:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
chair went after this was that they put
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
in that bill that's going to pass this
 
04:21:33.040 --> 04:21:34.469 align:start position:0%
in that bill that's going to pass this
year

04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:21:37.510 --> 04:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
and to change everything again
 
04:21:40.710 --> 04:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
and they were undergoing a fiscal audit
 
04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
that they had asked for
 
04:21:45.429 --> 04:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
so not a fiscal one a performance audit
 
04:21:48.070 --> 04:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
um because they were in such trouble
 
04:21:48.080 --> 04:21:49.110 align:start position:0%
um because they were in such trouble
on

04:21:49.110 --> 04:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:21:51.990 --> 04:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
and so we looked at each other and said
 
04:21:52.000 --> 04:21:52.950 align:start position:0%
and so we looked at each other and said
this

04:21:52.950 --> 04:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:21:55.110 --> 04:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
is not the time for them to change
 
04:21:57.269 --> 04:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
everything again in law
 
04:22:00.469 --> 04:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
not knowing that this new director
 
04:22:02.790 --> 04:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
who wasn't director yet actually was
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
quite competent and had created this
 
04:22:08.389 --> 04:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
this bill so the bill is going through
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
again this year it got killed last year
 
04:22:12.710 --> 04:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's the only one the house killed out
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:18.800 --> 04:22:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:23.990 --> 04:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're hoping it is now a dedicated fund
 
04:22:24.000 --> 04:22:24.950 align:start position:0%
we're hoping it is now a dedicated fund
and

04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:27.110 --> 04:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
on the dedicated fund committee which i
 
04:22:29.349 --> 04:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
hope will be on still
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
is going to to be looking at it on this
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
summer because we were told the
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
performance audit would be finished this
 
04:22:39.429 --> 04:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
they were going to do a fiscal audit
 
04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
because we were concerned with the whole
 
04:22:40.960 --> 04:22:42.309 align:start position:0%
because we were concerned with the whole
thing

04:22:42.309 --> 04:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
and this summer the dedicated fund
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
committee whoever is doing it will be uh
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
be looking at that
 
04:22:51.840 --> 04:22:53.910 align:start position:0%
be looking at that
again

04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
but ways and means got dealt out of the
 
04:22:58.950 --> 04:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
picture unfortunately
 
04:23:02.309 --> 04:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:02.319 --> 04:23:03.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:23:03.269 --> 04:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
um a question from representative hacken
 
04:23:06.560 --> 04:23:08.389 align:start position:0%
um a question from representative hacken
phillips

04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
phillips
 
04:23:14.309 --> 04:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i am wondering um
 
04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
dana on your slide number seven
 
04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
04:23:21.750 --> 04:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
line item sale of real property
 
04:23:23.670 --> 04:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
administrative services is the agency
 
04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
but then no numerical values across the
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
graph could you speak to us please
 
04:23:32.950 --> 04:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
yes we have if um
 
04:23:35.590 --> 04:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
if there is a planned sale of a general
 
04:23:38.309 --> 04:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
fund property uh we would report it here
 
04:23:39.910 --> 04:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't necessarily happen
 
04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
every year so there may be other funded
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
properties that dot might sell
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
right-of-ways that sort of thing but
 
04:23:49.110 --> 04:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
04:23:51.910 --> 04:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
general fund oriented properties
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
and there are none that i know of
 
04:23:53.520 --> 04:24:02.149 align:start position:0%
and there are none that i know of
upcoming

04:24:02.149 --> 04:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:03.910 --> 04:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
you have your hand raised you have
 
04:24:09.429 --> 04:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:12.550 --> 04:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:14.229 --> 04:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
yeah but my hand really wasn't up but
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'll just chime in on the last comment i
 
04:24:17.910 --> 04:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
mean would it would the example of that
 
04:24:19.830 --> 04:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
be the uh
 
04:24:21.510 --> 04:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
the school i think it's the hospital
 
04:24:24.149 --> 04:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
lebanon the school or the or the old
 
04:24:26.389 --> 04:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
hospital up in lebanon it's been up for
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
a long time
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
lakes region maybe
 
04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
say again
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:38.149 --> 04:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure about the lebanon one i
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
know um
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm trying to think
 
04:24:47.030 --> 04:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead i'm at laconia
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i meant laconia laconia yeah
 
04:24:53.760 --> 04:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i meant laconia laconia yeah
right

04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that if if that were that would be
 
04:24:59.189 --> 04:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
reported here because that's been that's
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
been up for sale for a long time and
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's just sitting there right
 
04:25:04.710 --> 04:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
correct uh yeah i don't know the act i
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
am not uh
 
04:25:07.910 --> 04:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
the source of the status on that
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
particular one so
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
um if charlie
 
04:25:13.990 --> 04:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
if charlie were with us he would know
 
04:25:17.830 --> 04:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
but that would be an example of if it
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
did sell with one up here
 
04:25:22.239 --> 04:25:23.110 align:start position:0%
did sell with one up here
yeah

04:25:23.110 --> 04:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
yeah if it was funded with general funds
 
04:25:27.269 --> 04:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
to be purchased to begin with but we
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't sell a whole lot of property
 
04:25:32.790 --> 04:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:36.229 --> 04:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
well example is that uh liquor sold uh
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
an old store but that that stays within
 
04:25:40.149 --> 04:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission um
 
04:25:41.830 --> 04:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
they they sold an old building that they
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
had two they think they were yeah
 
04:25:46.469 --> 04:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
it depends
 
04:25:48.229 --> 04:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
typically if it was funded through
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
liquor funds yes right right sometimes
 
04:25:53.110 --> 04:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
that varies depending on the original
 
04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
as far as selling
 
04:26:00.399 --> 04:26:01.990 align:start position:0%
as far as selling
property

04:26:01.990 --> 04:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
is it you end up leasing a lot of
 
04:26:04.800 --> 04:26:06.550 align:start position:0%
is it you end up leasing a lot of
property

04:26:06.550 --> 04:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:26:08.229 --> 04:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
especially if it
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:14.469 --> 04:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
04:26:16.710 --> 04:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we do have a lot of leases those
 
04:26:18.790 --> 04:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
are managed here in admin services in
 
04:26:23.030 --> 04:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
wow a way i had a schedule here
 
04:26:31.830 --> 04:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
i know i i can't really feel an hour to
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
just with other
 
04:26:35.910 --> 04:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we could talk about the kafir or any
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
other items you might want to talk about
 
04:26:38.080 --> 04:26:38.950 align:start position:0%
other items you might want to talk about
but

04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:26:41.670 --> 04:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
um other revenue is is a small piece of
 
04:26:44.710 --> 04:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
the puzzle
 
04:26:47.830 --> 04:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
um that's not a bad idea
 
04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
give a high level of the chapter
 
04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
and how it varies from the
 
04:26:57.269 --> 04:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
revenue focus and
 
04:26:59.910 --> 04:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
everything else that we report
 
04:27:02.710 --> 04:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
on a cash basis
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
did you folks get copies
 
04:27:05.439 --> 04:27:06.469 align:start position:0%
did you folks get copies
um

04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
by any chance
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.760 --> 04:27:12.550 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:27:12.550 --> 04:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
i did i
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
made a copy of the chair against it i
 
04:27:16.960 --> 04:27:17.910 align:start position:0%
made a copy of the chair against it i
think

04:27:17.910 --> 04:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:27:17.920 --> 04:27:19.349 align:start position:0%
think
yeah

04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:27:21.910 --> 04:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
no okay this is chris um just to let you
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
know we do have copies for the committee
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
they're sitting in my office their hard
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
copy we're just trying to figure out how
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
to get them to the various committees
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
because there are a couple of uh agency
 
04:27:33.269 --> 04:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
reports that we're trying to determine
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
how to the best way to get them out
 
04:27:37.670 --> 04:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
and so we do it in a consistent fashion
 
04:27:39.269 --> 04:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
between finance ways and means and
 
04:27:41.110 --> 04:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
public works
 
04:27:43.590 --> 04:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
so hopefully those will be out soon
 
04:27:46.149 --> 04:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh actually
 
04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
the whole committee even though we have
 
04:27:51.670 --> 04:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
a hearing tomorrow public hearings
 
04:27:53.189 --> 04:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
i think there's only seven of us are
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
going to show up and everybody else is
 
04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
going to do it virtually
 
04:27:59.910 --> 04:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
so probably it'd be best if you could
 
04:28:02.389 --> 04:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
mail those out to the committee members
 
04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
i i think we would all would appreciate
 
04:28:05.359 --> 04:28:06.309 align:start position:0%
i i think we would all would appreciate
it

04:28:06.309 --> 04:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh understand um represent major the the
 
04:28:10.710 --> 04:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
issue we're dealing with is
 
04:28:12.870 --> 04:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
um the volume of mail that's being
 
04:28:14.309 --> 04:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
requested and we're trying to determine
 
04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
the best way to go about that
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's one small document for for this
 
04:28:20.790 --> 04:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
agent for this committee but we've got
 
04:28:23.030 --> 04:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
finance as well so we're trying to have
 
04:28:24.870 --> 04:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
a consistent approach to the committees
 
04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we distribute documents
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
so that we're not mailing thousands of
 
04:28:31.030 --> 04:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
pieces of paper to every member of a
 
04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
committee that may not want it
 
04:28:33.359 --> 04:28:34.149 align:start position:0%
committee that may not want it
so

04:28:34.149 --> 04:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:36.229 --> 04:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
i get direction from the lba on what how
 
04:28:37.910 --> 04:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
he wants to handle that i will certainly
 
04:28:39.910 --> 04:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
make sure the committee gets what's due
 
04:28:41.110 --> 04:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
to them
 
04:28:45.510 --> 04:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:48.630 --> 04:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
right so for now um it is available on
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
our website the same web
 
04:28:53.910 --> 04:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
website address that i gave you for the
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
revenue focus
 
04:28:57.910 --> 04:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
we do keep all of our accounting reports
 
04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
on that same page so the kafir the
 
04:29:04.389 --> 04:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
federal single audit the dedicated funds
 
04:29:06.870 --> 04:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
report all of those reports if you visit
 
04:29:06.880 --> 04:29:08.149 align:start position:0%
report all of those reports if you visit
that

04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:29:11.830 --> 04:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
accounting web page reside in one place
 
04:29:13.590 --> 04:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
and they're all available to look at
 
04:29:13.600 --> 04:29:15.189 align:start position:0%
and they're all available to look at
online

04:29:15.189 --> 04:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
online
 
04:29:17.510 --> 04:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
kafir in particular is nice to look at
 
04:29:19.830 --> 04:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
online because it is it is a book it's a
 
04:29:22.469 --> 04:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
very large document so
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
you can
 
04:29:26.710 --> 04:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
poke around as you like online
 
04:29:29.110 --> 04:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
i think some of the
 
04:29:31.670 --> 04:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
the most i guess relevant pieces would
 
04:29:31.680 --> 04:29:32.710 align:start position:0%
the most i guess relevant pieces would
be

04:29:32.710 --> 04:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:29:34.309 --> 04:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
in the beginning there's a transmittal
 
04:29:34.319 --> 04:29:35.189 align:start position:0%
in the beginning there's a transmittal
letter

04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
letter
 
04:29:37.110 --> 04:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner from charlie
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus and in that we put the
 
04:29:41.429 --> 04:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund surplus
 
04:29:43.910 --> 04:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
statements so typically that's a good
 
04:29:46.070 --> 04:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
place to look at the very beginning of
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
the document there's a
 
04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
nice letter that talks about all the
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
things that transpired over the year and
 
04:29:55.030 --> 04:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
the general and education trust fund
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
surplus statements are
 
04:29:59.590 --> 04:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
more of a statutory reporting item
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
they're not an audited financial
 
04:30:02.950 --> 04:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
statement so they go in the transmittal
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
letter we prepare those here at admin
 
04:30:07.990 --> 04:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
services and
 
04:30:10.389 --> 04:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
the auditors don't typically focus on
 
04:30:12.149 --> 04:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
that area
 
04:30:14.149 --> 04:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
but it is important to legislators
 
04:30:16.389 --> 04:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
because that is the presentation that
 
04:30:18.870 --> 04:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
you're used to looking at so
 
04:30:20.149 --> 04:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
all of our
 
04:30:22.469 --> 04:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue numbers
 
04:30:25.750 --> 04:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
show up there in the surplus statements
 
04:30:28.229 --> 04:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
and you can see where we ended the
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
balance for the year in both the general
 
04:30:32.070 --> 04:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
and education trust fund
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
so that's a helpful document
 
04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
we also
 
04:30:37.750 --> 04:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
the audited financial statements if
 
04:30:39.750 --> 04:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with a typical balance
 
04:30:42.309 --> 04:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
sheet income statement type presentation
 
04:30:45.189 --> 04:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
that is that is what the auditors give
 
04:30:47.590 --> 04:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
us an opinion on we received
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
an unmodified opinion this year which
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
means all was good
 
04:30:51.120 --> 04:30:51.990 align:start position:0%
means all was good
um

04:30:51.990 --> 04:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
happy to report that even with
 
04:30:57.349 --> 04:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
our teams being almost 100 remote and
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
the audit being 100 remote which has
 
04:31:01.830 --> 04:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
never happened before we were able to
 
04:31:04.469 --> 04:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
get the audit done on time and with a
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
clean opinion so
 
04:31:08.229 --> 04:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
i'll take every opportunity i can to
 
04:31:10.229 --> 04:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
talk about that
 
04:31:10.239 --> 04:31:11.750 align:start position:0%
talk about that
congratulations

04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
04:31:14.229 --> 04:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
we're very proud of that here so
 
04:31:16.389 --> 04:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
um thank you so so that's a good
 
04:31:18.630 --> 04:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
document uh the balance sheet this year
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
has a new column in it so you would see
 
04:31:23.349 --> 04:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
i apologize i can't throw it up right
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
now but you would see a general fund an
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the highway fund
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then we have the new
 
04:31:31.510 --> 04:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
coronavirus relief fund column
 
04:31:35.349 --> 04:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
so we were able to show separately
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
not all money that's come from the cares
 
04:31:40.710 --> 04:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
act in general but the 1.25 billion that
 
04:31:43.110 --> 04:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
was allocated to the state
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
that we received up front and that the
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
gopher office has been distributing
 
04:31:51.429 --> 04:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
for the last almost a year
 
04:31:54.149 --> 04:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
that we have highlighted in our kafir
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
report this year
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
so you can see that information and the
 
04:32:01.110 --> 04:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
auditors have also audited that
 
04:32:04.950 --> 04:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
and then sort of in the the back section
 
04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
is where you'll find a lot of the items
 
04:32:07.830 --> 04:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about the
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue details and
 
04:32:13.349 --> 04:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
that's where you would see we don't
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
provide necessarily a reconciliation
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
between cash and accrual basis but you
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
will find if you look at a focus report
 
04:32:22.950 --> 04:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal year and you look at the
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
kafir unrestricted revenue page
 
04:32:27.750 --> 04:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
for general funds they will be different
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
numbers and i know in the past
 
04:32:32.070 --> 04:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
chris has provided the committee with
 
04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
some information on that too
 
04:32:37.110 --> 04:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
they do differ as i said every every
 
04:32:39.910 --> 04:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
year because of accrual adjustments but
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
this particular year being a big one
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
you will see a difference in the total
 
04:32:46.710 --> 04:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
per the kaffir versus what's reported in
 
04:32:51.429 --> 04:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
the cash basis focus so
 
04:32:52.950 --> 04:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
next time we're together in person i'd
 
04:32:56.149 --> 04:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
be happy to point those pages out to you
 
04:32:56.159 --> 04:32:56.950 align:start position:0%
be happy to point those pages out to you
but

04:32:56.950 --> 04:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
for now
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
i'd encourage you to go to our webpage
 
04:33:00.159 --> 04:33:00.950 align:start position:0%
i'd encourage you to go to our webpage
and

04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:02.710 --> 04:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
find all of the documents that we
 
04:33:05.830 --> 04:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
produce here at admin services
 
04:33:07.830 --> 04:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
yeah what i usually do is i go to the
 
04:33:10.629 --> 04:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
cafe and i pull these pages out to be
 
04:33:10.639 --> 04:33:11.670 align:start position:0%
cafe and i pull these pages out to be
printed

04:33:11.670 --> 04:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
printed
 
04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
yes uh you know the information all in
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
there is important but there's
 
04:33:21.990 --> 04:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
definitely pages that you want to focus
 
04:33:25.990 --> 04:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
saying then uh thank you dana uh
 
04:33:39.510 --> 04:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
you're welcome anytime
 
04:33:42.561 --> 04:33:45.189 align:start position:0%
you're welcome anytime
okay

04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
all right have a good afternoon
 
04:33:49.349 --> 04:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
the treasurer is supposed to comment uh
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
too is
 
04:33:56.629 --> 04:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
is she here yet
 
04:33:59.189 --> 04:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
i don't see her um in the attendee list
 
04:34:00.390 --> 04:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
quite yet
 
04:34:00.400 --> 04:34:04.629 align:start position:0%
quite yet
okay

04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
when she does show up we can
 
04:34:09.590 --> 04:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think we'll have a problem
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
getting started
 
04:34:15.029 --> 04:34:15.039 align:start position:0%
really i hope not
 
04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
because i look at the attendee list
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the ones in the attendees
 
04:34:24.390 --> 04:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's correct so we have two
 
04:34:26.230 --> 04:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
two people there right now and so i'm
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
just watching to see
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
um when treasurer mezzapelli um comes to
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
join us
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you if you guys have
 
04:34:36.551 --> 04:34:36.561 align:start position:0%
anything to talk about or maybe you just
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
want to take
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know a five minute break i'm sure
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
she'll be in soon
 
04:34:43.830 --> 04:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't we take a break until
 
04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:20.948 --> 04:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
hi treasurer mizipelli
 
04:43:22.948 --> 04:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
this is jen the committee researcher i
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
just wanted to let you know that i've
 
04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
promoted you to panelists
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
um and you can mute one when they're
 
04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
ready to begin the committee's just on a
 
04:43:31.270 --> 04:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
quick break until
 
04:43:34.150 --> 04:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:22.000 --> 04:44:54.868 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:44:54.868 --> 04:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:57.350 --> 04:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
bob elliott
 
04:44:57.360 --> 04:44:58.868 align:start position:0%
bob elliott
yes

04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:45:02.948 --> 04:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:07.110 --> 04:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:11.350 --> 04:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:11.360 --> 04:45:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
fine

04:45:15.190 --> 04:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:15.200 --> 04:45:16.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:45:18.230 --> 04:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
very complicated
 
04:45:20.708 --> 04:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
but i would prefer to have it in writing
 
04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
so i could study it more
 
04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
because you veterans all know from being
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
there so long
 
04:45:29.350 --> 04:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what's going on but the
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
conversations are limited to three or
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
four people
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
and not the nine new members that are on
 
04:45:37.590 --> 04:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
the board
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
so they must be having the same
 
04:45:42.070 --> 04:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
difficulties that i'm having too is
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
following it because it's so intense
 
04:45:47.430 --> 04:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
and so complicated
 
04:45:50.830 --> 04:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:50.840 --> 04:45:52.470 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
what we've been doing thus far is really
 
04:45:56.788 --> 04:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
an introduction
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
and uh going over all the various uh
 
04:46:03.910 --> 04:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
factors involved with the revenues
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
from the economics through the agency
 
04:46:06.240 --> 04:46:07.670 align:start position:0%
from the economics through the agency
heads

04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
heads
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
and then the work starts when we start
 
04:46:11.750 --> 04:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
having the work sessions
 
04:46:14.310 --> 04:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
and when we go to work sessions we'll
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
bring these all these agency heads back
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
in again even economists if we have to
 
04:46:22.230 --> 04:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
okay and uh
 
04:46:22.240 --> 04:46:23.350 align:start position:0%
okay and uh
everybody

04:46:23.350 --> 04:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully will be participating asking
 
04:46:27.670 --> 04:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
the questions especially the
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
the new people
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
because you really don't get to
 
04:46:36.550 --> 04:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
understand it until you participate
 
04:46:36.560 --> 04:46:37.990 align:start position:0%
understand it until you participate
okay

04:46:37.990 --> 04:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
well i'm not shy
 
04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
good i know you're not that's why
 
04:46:45.510 --> 04:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have to agree with me
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
let me ask you a question mr chairman
 
04:46:47.600 --> 04:46:48.628 align:start position:0%
let me ask you a question mr chairman
yes

04:46:48.628 --> 04:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
again from a newbie perspective
 
04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know and tell me if i'm wrong in
 
04:46:55.590 --> 04:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
assuming this but i'm i'm listening to
 
04:46:56.868 --> 04:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
this and i would agree with bob that
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:46:59.430 --> 04:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
it's complicated especially when you
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
don't understand the history
 
04:47:04.070 --> 04:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
and all the mechanics of where funds
 
04:47:05.910 --> 04:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
shift to and from and
 
04:47:07.590 --> 04:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know the previous bills that have
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
been passed and
 
04:47:11.910 --> 04:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
changed the the these budgets
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
04:47:13.680 --> 04:47:15.110 align:start position:0%
having said that
um

04:47:15.110 --> 04:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:17.830 --> 04:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
how much of the work that we do
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the new bills coming forward
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
influence the budget going forward
 
04:47:22.798 --> 04:47:23.910 align:start position:0%
influence the budget going forward
meaning

04:47:23.910 --> 04:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
say for instance you just got rid of a
 
04:47:27.750 --> 04:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
revenue source of a significant amount
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
in a bill
 
04:47:30.948 --> 04:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
how does that impact what the work we're
 
04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
doing in the work groups next week and
 
04:47:35.110 --> 04:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
04:47:35.120 --> 04:47:36.390 align:start position:0%
beyond that
okay

04:47:36.390 --> 04:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:47:38.310 --> 04:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
04:47:40.868 --> 04:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
the work we've been doing right now has
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
to do with the
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
revenue streams
 
04:47:48.310 --> 04:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
that are in existence for current law
 
04:47:48.320 --> 04:47:49.110 align:start position:0%
that are in existence for current law
and

04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with the legislation
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
our base for revenues is what does our
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
current law say
 
04:48:00.868 --> 04:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
if we can pass revenues such as
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:10.868 --> 04:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
credits and things like that then that
 
04:48:12.390 --> 04:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
will affect
 
04:48:14.150 --> 04:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
what our revenues are either drive them
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
up or drive them down
 
04:48:18.868 --> 04:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
whatever the revenues are
 
04:48:21.350 --> 04:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
is what the finance has to live with
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:25.830 --> 04:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
it seems like we're doing it
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
concurrently that's what i was saying it
 
04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
seems like
 
04:48:30.310 --> 04:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out you know i've
 
04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
been involved in making budgets for
 
04:48:31.920 --> 04:48:33.110 align:start position:0%
been involved in making budgets for
hospitals

04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
04:48:35.110 --> 04:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
but we kind of understood the ground
 
04:48:36.628 --> 04:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
rules and it feels like we're trying to
 
04:48:36.638 --> 04:48:37.590 align:start position:0%
rules and it feels like we're trying to
do

04:48:37.590 --> 04:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
a budget in revenue predictions
 
04:48:43.190 --> 04:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
concurrently with potential you know
 
04:48:45.270 --> 04:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
bills that may change our assumptions is
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
what i was thinking so
 
04:48:49.510 --> 04:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
right you have to first of all
 
04:48:51.750 --> 04:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
get current law is going away that's
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
your base
 
04:48:56.788 --> 04:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
okay and whatever you do to affect that
 
04:48:58.310 --> 04:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
is coming up in
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
the bills the bills may be
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
individual bills or it could be part of
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
the budget process
 
04:49:08.550 --> 04:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
those are the budgets under house bill
 
04:49:10.788 --> 04:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
one all the appropriations
 
04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
and to make the budget work
 
04:49:15.750 --> 04:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
you take the revenue projections that we
 
04:49:15.760 --> 04:49:16.788 align:start position:0%
you take the revenue projections that we
have

04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
and then in house bill one will be well
 
04:49:22.550 --> 04:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
changing a rate or adding a new
 
04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:30.070 --> 04:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
norm can i take a crack at this sure
 
04:49:30.080 --> 04:49:31.350 align:start position:0%
norm can i take a crack at this sure
jim

04:49:31.350 --> 04:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
jim
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's real simple between now and the
 
04:49:34.948 --> 04:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
middle of february
 
04:49:36.310 --> 04:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
we're not going to worry about any of
 
04:49:37.670 --> 04:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
the other bills that are coming up that
 
04:49:40.310 --> 04:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
are going to change revenues up or down
 
04:49:42.390 --> 04:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to do strict what's current
 
04:49:42.400 --> 04:49:43.430 align:start position:0%
we're going to do strict what's current
law

04:49:43.430 --> 04:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:49:44.550 --> 04:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we're going to base our
 
04:49:46.788 --> 04:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
numbers on then later on
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
because you got to remember budget bills
 
04:49:50.708 --> 04:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
revenue bills any kind of bill has to
 
04:49:52.230 --> 04:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
pass both houses
 
04:49:54.150 --> 04:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
so we are not going to know what's
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
passed and then the governor has to sign
 
04:49:55.680 --> 04:49:56.390 align:start position:0%
passed and then the governor has to sign
it

04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:49:58.230 --> 04:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
so we won't know until
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
way into june
 
04:50:00.000 --> 04:50:00.868 align:start position:0%
way into june
what's

04:50:00.868 --> 04:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
what's
 
04:50:03.910 --> 04:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
law new law in terms of and then and
 
04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
maybe chris can explain that he's paying
 
04:50:07.830 --> 04:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
it he may uh
 
04:50:09.270 --> 04:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
that they they call it the back of the
 
04:50:11.750 --> 04:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
budget they make these the ads revenues
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
that subtract what wasn't chris jump in
 
04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
04:50:17.350 --> 04:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
lit up there chris so just just to
 
04:50:18.708 --> 04:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
further explain
 
04:50:18.718 --> 04:50:19.590 align:start position:0%
further explain
um

04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:21.190 --> 04:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative abrami and reps and major
 
04:50:22.708 --> 04:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct you're going to make
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
your revenue forecast on current law
 
04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
but you also know there's bills out
 
04:50:28.708 --> 04:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
there that may have an impact on that
 
04:50:30.150 --> 04:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
and the house may pass some of those
 
04:50:30.160 --> 04:50:31.190 align:start position:0%
and the house may pass some of those
bills

04:50:31.190 --> 04:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
our office the legislative budget
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
assistant office will take those bills
 
04:50:36.310 --> 04:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
as we build the surplus statement and as
 
04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
the finance committee is building its
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
budget and will make them aware that
 
04:50:46.470 --> 04:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
um the house has passed house bill 123
 
04:50:48.150 --> 04:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
and that's going to you know change the
 
04:50:50.390 --> 04:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
business tax rates by increasing the bet
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
by a point and decreasing the bpt by a
 
04:50:54.628 --> 04:50:54.638 align:start position:0%
point and this is the impact on revenue
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
so we would
 
04:50:58.470 --> 04:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
carry a line on what you so we'll hear
 
04:51:00.310 --> 04:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
referred to as schedule 2
 
04:51:01.750 --> 04:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
of the surplus statement and that will
 
04:51:03.990 --> 04:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
be a revenue adjustment to take care of
 
04:51:06.868 --> 04:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
that so you end up with a house
 
04:51:09.030 --> 04:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
so whatever budget you pass
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
with the trailer bill there will be a
 
04:51:11.910 --> 04:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
surplus associated with that which would
 
04:51:14.628 --> 04:51:14.638 align:start position:0%
be the house position then the senate
 
04:51:16.470 --> 04:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
would take their crack at it
 
04:51:17.990 --> 04:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
they may or may not agree with some of
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
the bills that are being passed by the
 
04:51:19.360 --> 04:51:20.150 align:start position:0%
the bills that are being passed by the
house

04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:51:21.590 --> 04:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
um they may have other ideas that they
 
04:51:22.948 --> 04:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
want to do so you would end up with a
 
04:51:25.030 --> 04:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
senate position and we would reflect any
 
04:51:26.230 --> 04:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
changes that
 
04:51:28.310 --> 04:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
were contained either in a separate bill
 
04:51:28.320 --> 04:51:29.190 align:start position:0%
were contained either in a separate bill
or

04:51:29.190 --> 04:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:51:32.070 --> 04:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
um were were brought into house bill 2
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
or the trailer bill
 
04:51:35.110 --> 04:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
um and then again at the committee a
 
04:51:36.310 --> 04:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
conference the house and the senate
 
04:51:39.030 --> 04:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
would um iron out any differences and
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
then a final surplus statement would be
 
04:51:42.628 --> 04:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
issued and with all the revenue
 
04:51:44.550 --> 04:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments and that is what um the
 
04:51:46.470 --> 04:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
comptroller mentioned earlier in her
 
04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
presentation they would take that
 
04:51:50.230 --> 04:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
surplus schedule
 
04:51:52.150 --> 04:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
and then build the revenue plan off from
 
04:51:53.430 --> 04:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
that so they would look at the
 
04:51:55.270 --> 04:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues in the back of
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 1 and then any other
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
adjustments that were
 
04:52:01.110 --> 04:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
captured in the surplus statement to
 
04:52:03.910 --> 04:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
build your official revenue plan
 
04:52:05.750 --> 04:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that is why i
 
04:52:08.628 --> 04:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
that's why our job is never done
 
04:52:08.638 --> 04:52:09.510 align:start position:0%
that's why our job is never done
really

04:52:09.510 --> 04:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
we'll be continuing looking at those
 
04:52:11.520 --> 04:52:12.708 align:start position:0%
we'll be continuing looking at those
revenues

04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
all the way up to the committee of
 
04:52:16.628 --> 04:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
conference and when we say look at those
 
04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
revenues current law and all the
 
04:52:21.510 --> 04:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
04:52:21.520 --> 04:52:22.230 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
in

04:52:22.230 --> 04:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
the budget bill and separate bills
 
04:52:27.110 --> 04:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's very appreciated and reassuring
 
04:52:28.550 --> 04:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
because i woke up in the middle of night
 
04:52:31.030 --> 04:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
with sweaty palms
 
04:52:32.550 --> 04:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
thinking that we were changing an engine
 
04:52:35.430 --> 04:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a flight you know so
 
04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's helpful thank you
 
04:52:40.150 --> 04:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
all right good uh ben
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
i have a question mr chairman yes
 
04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
04:52:49.270 --> 04:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh last week we received uh
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
a mailing of all the bills and then on
 
04:52:55.670 --> 04:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
thursday's meeting
 
04:52:58.470 --> 04:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
at 9 00 a.m and 9 30
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
house bill 533 and house bill 568 were
 
04:53:04.788 --> 04:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
not included
 
04:53:07.030 --> 04:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
in that package
 
04:53:10.390 --> 04:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
is that just an oversight or
 
04:53:12.310 --> 04:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
those those two bills which are the
 
04:53:15.510 --> 04:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
first things on the agenda
 
04:53:19.350 --> 04:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:23.350 --> 04:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
five three three and five six eight
 
04:53:25.590 --> 04:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah those are what we're going to be
 
04:53:28.868 --> 04:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
dealing with tomorrow i believe yeah
 
04:53:30.868 --> 04:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
please yes tomorrow
 
04:53:30.878 --> 04:53:33.510 align:start position:0%
please yes tomorrow
no

04:53:33.510 --> 04:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:36.390 --> 04:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to interrupt but um
 
04:53:38.868 --> 04:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
just to explain
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
there were some bills that were missing
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
for each committee because we were only
 
04:53:44.150 --> 04:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
able to mail out what we've received
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
from the print shop
 
04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
so far and there are certain bills that
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
had not come
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
back from the print shop
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
at the time of mailing so that is
 
04:53:56.230 --> 04:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
probably why they weren't included in
 
04:53:58.390 --> 04:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
your first mailing
 
04:54:01.110 --> 04:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
what i would do is
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
go to the
 
04:54:02.480 --> 04:54:03.670 align:start position:0%
go to the
website

04:54:03.670 --> 04:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
website
 
04:54:06.390 --> 04:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
and download the bill
 
04:54:09.670 --> 04:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:11.830 --> 04:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's the only way you'll have a copy
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
okay what website is that
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
you go to
 
04:54:18.080 --> 04:54:20.868 align:start position:0%
you go to
nh.gov

04:54:20.868 --> 04:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
nh.gov
 
04:54:23.670 --> 04:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
i can send him the link representing me
 
04:54:23.680 --> 04:54:25.030 align:start position:0%
i can send him the link representing me
okay

04:54:25.030 --> 04:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's not going to appreciate that
 
04:54:26.400 --> 04:54:27.510 align:start position:0%
it's not going to appreciate that
jennifer

04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
jennifer
 
04:54:30.550 --> 04:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
why don't you send it to all of us yeah
 
04:54:32.708 --> 04:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
i will do that that'd be great and when
 
04:54:35.590 --> 04:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
you pull up the website the first thing
 
04:54:37.590 --> 04:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
will be is a place you put your bill
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
number in you put that in
 
04:54:41.270 --> 04:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
click on it
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:47.590 --> 04:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
04:54:47.600 --> 04:54:49.750 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
the

04:54:49.750 --> 04:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:49.760 --> 04:54:51.910 align:start position:0%
the
schedule

04:54:51.910 --> 04:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
04:54:53.510 --> 04:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
i can't think of all
 
04:54:55.510 --> 04:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
but all the information relative to that
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill the docket it's been scheduled etc
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
okay i just don't want the champion i
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
think i'm not doing my homework
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
you need to pick up the pdf
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
not the text version because the pdf
 
04:55:12.550 --> 04:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
will have line numbers and somebody may
 
04:55:16.550 --> 04:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
say look at line 16 on page two
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
that's a that's important the pdf copy
 
04:55:23.270 --> 04:55:23.280 align:start position:0%

i'm just going to try to do that right
now

04:56:48.390 --> 04:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:51.990 --> 04:56:52.000 align:start position:0%

04:56:53.440 --> 04:56:54.230 align:start position:0%
very good
um

04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:56.788 --> 04:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
so um when i was asked to uh to come
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
back and speak of abandoned property i
 
04:57:00.390 --> 04:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
just thought it uh
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know in addition to the items that
 
04:57:02.160 --> 04:57:03.670 align:start position:0%
you know in addition to the items that
um

04:57:03.670 --> 04:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:05.590 --> 04:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
were part of the the request i just
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
thought that providing an overview of
 
04:57:09.830 --> 04:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
the program it would be a good start for
 
04:57:11.910 --> 04:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
especially for members that are new to
 
04:57:13.350 --> 04:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:57:13.360 --> 04:57:14.230 align:start position:0%
the committee
um

04:57:14.230 --> 04:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:17.110 --> 04:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
so i will um so my intent today is our
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
intent is to again provide an overview
 
04:57:21.670 --> 04:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
so we'll cover uh very briefly how the
 
04:57:25.110 --> 04:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
promo program works and
 
04:57:27.430 --> 04:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about reporting of abandoned
 
04:57:27.440 --> 04:57:28.708 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about reporting of abandoned
property

04:57:28.708 --> 04:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:57:31.190 --> 04:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
the claims against that property
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
how we determine the general fund is
 
04:57:32.878 --> 04:57:34.070 align:start position:0%
how we determine the general fund is
treatment

04:57:34.070 --> 04:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:57:36.868 --> 04:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
and some of the trends and initiatives
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
that may impact uh this activity and for
 
04:57:43.030 --> 04:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
that i will ask director makanespi to
 
04:57:45.030 --> 04:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
to provide some details
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
so again i will start with a brief
 
04:57:56.470 --> 04:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:59.110 --> 04:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
um charges the estate treasuries
 
04:58:00.868 --> 04:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
abandoned property division with the
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility of recovering and
 
04:58:06.628 --> 04:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
returning intangible property to right
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
to individuals to the rightful owners
 
04:58:11.350 --> 04:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
so typically
 
04:58:14.628 --> 04:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
the property that that we receive
 
04:58:17.430 --> 04:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
is cash from dorman accounts
 
04:58:19.670 --> 04:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
so and it could also include securities
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
such as stock
 
04:58:21.600 --> 04:58:25.190 align:start position:0%
such as stock
um

04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:26.660 --> 04:58:26.670 align:start position:0%
mutual funds
 
04:58:26.670 --> 04:58:29.510 align:start position:0%
mutual funds
[Music]

04:58:29.510 --> 04:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:58:34.230 --> 04:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me hey jen can you uh mute
 
04:58:35.670 --> 04:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
the ones
 
04:58:43.990 --> 04:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:47.110 --> 04:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so uh so so so we receive cash
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
from german accounts and also securities
 
04:58:50.160 --> 04:58:51.030 align:start position:0%
from german accounts and also securities
um

04:58:51.030 --> 04:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:52.948 --> 04:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
could be in the form of stock of mutual
 
04:58:52.958 --> 04:58:53.910 align:start position:0%
could be in the form of stock of mutual
funds

04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
um so this property properties really
 
04:58:58.070 --> 04:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
come from institutional holders that
 
04:59:00.390 --> 04:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
report to us and remit to us
 
04:59:03.030 --> 04:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
and primarily those are banks create
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
unions corporations insurance companies
 
04:59:09.430 --> 04:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh governmental agencies municipalities
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:59:13.190 --> 04:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
each october we publish as many of you
 
04:59:15.270 --> 04:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
know may know we publish an annual
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
listing of all the names that we receive
 
04:59:21.830 --> 04:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
um every year and and so we we
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're less than the union leader mainly
 
04:59:27.350 --> 04:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
the list of properties in the list of
 
04:59:30.150 --> 04:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
names with the last known address
 
04:59:32.708 --> 04:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
we also do a mailing in the form of
 
04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
postcard notification
 
04:59:37.510 --> 04:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
again send it to this
 
04:59:39.190 --> 04:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
we sent it to the last known address
 
04:59:40.948 --> 04:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
that we have on record and those
 
04:59:43.190 --> 04:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
mailings usually happen in august in
 
04:59:43.200 --> 04:59:44.550 align:start position:0%
mailings usually happen in august in
september

04:59:44.550 --> 04:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
september
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh of each year
 
04:59:48.788 --> 04:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
so um so in addition to that the way we
 
04:59:51.190 --> 04:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
advertise um so that's the way one way
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
we advertise but um in 2020 we upgraded
 
04:59:58.150 --> 04:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
our unclaimed property system so
 
05:00:01.590 --> 05:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
individuals now can now
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
do online searches directly into our
 
05:00:04.000 --> 05:00:05.270 align:start position:0%
do online searches directly into our
database

05:00:05.270 --> 05:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
database
 
05:00:07.030 --> 05:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
and if if
 
05:00:08.788 --> 05:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
also if they want to if they want to
 
05:00:10.948 --> 05:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
start initiate a claim online they can
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
also do that and also upload the support
 
05:00:16.628 --> 05:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
and documentation to be able to claim
 
05:00:18.390 --> 05:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
05:00:20.470 --> 05:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
the other way we um
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
our program works is we we also
 
05:00:25.430 --> 05:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
participate um we still participate uh
 
05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
using the missingmoney.com which is a
 
05:00:29.990 --> 05:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
multi-state database of unclaimed
 
05:00:32.550 --> 05:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
property so we still use that uh so we
 
05:00:34.868 --> 05:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
have a variety of ways of how
 
05:00:40.628 --> 05:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the the reporting of of
 
05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
properties so this this chart really
 
05:00:46.080 --> 05:00:47.590 align:start position:0%
properties so this this chart really
shows

05:00:47.590 --> 05:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
shows
 
05:00:49.750 --> 05:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
the activity over the last 10 fiscal
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
years so
 
05:00:53.750 --> 05:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
um during that time we have
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
um collected about 177 million from
 
05:01:00.550 --> 05:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
holders and that's an average of 17.7
 
05:01:04.788 --> 05:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
um also when um
 
05:01:10.150 --> 05:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal year 20 we we receive
 
05:01:12.150 --> 05:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
approximately 20 million
 
05:01:14.310 --> 05:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
and that was um
 
05:01:16.550 --> 05:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
from approximately four four thousand
 
05:01:18.390 --> 05:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
seven hundred institutional holders so
 
05:01:21.510 --> 05:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
that is also shown on the next chart
 
05:01:24.628 --> 05:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
so this chart shows um the activity
 
05:01:24.638 --> 05:01:25.670 align:start position:0%
so this chart shows um the activity
um

05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
over the last ten years
 
05:01:31.110 --> 05:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
of holders reporting to the division
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
so again in 2020
 
05:01:36.070 --> 05:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
um approximately four thousand seven
 
05:01:37.590 --> 05:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
hundred institutional holders were
 
05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
reported to us
 
05:01:42.550 --> 05:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
um and and that was again about 20
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars and also delivered over
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
8.9 million
 
05:01:53.910 --> 05:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.750 --> 05:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:01.510 --> 05:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
the division paid
 
05:02:04.868 --> 05:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
approximately 7.5 million to citizens
 
05:02:06.380 --> 05:02:06.390 align:start position:0%
and that's about
 
05:02:06.390 --> 05:02:07.470 align:start position:0%
and that's about
[Music]

05:02:07.470 --> 05:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
6868 claims
 
05:02:12.150 --> 05:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
so again this chart shows the activity
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years
 
05:02:18.788 --> 05:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
we return approximately 66.9 million in
 
05:02:21.840 --> 05:02:22.948 align:start position:0%
we return approximately 66.9 million in
property

05:02:22.948 --> 05:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
which is an average of 6.6 million a
 
05:02:25.680 --> 05:02:31.350 align:start position:0%
which is an average of 6.6 million a
year

05:02:31.350 --> 05:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:33.670 --> 05:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh so this brings us to um you know this
 
05:02:35.990 --> 05:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
gma calculation this is how we this is
 
05:02:38.230 --> 05:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
how we calculate the amount that we
 
05:02:40.628 --> 05:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
remain to the right to the general fund
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
um so in this calculation this is the
 
05:02:45.750 --> 05:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 calculation
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
we um
 
05:02:49.440 --> 05:02:53.350 align:start position:0%
we um
so

05:02:53.350 --> 05:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:55.830 --> 05:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
what i what i mean to say here is the
 
05:02:57.430 --> 05:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
law allows us to
 
05:03:00.310 --> 05:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
again the program is assigned to to
 
05:03:02.390 --> 05:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
recover those those properties those
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
funds and also return those funds to
 
05:03:07.670 --> 05:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
individual to individuals
 
05:03:09.990 --> 05:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
and encompa in corporations too
 
05:03:13.510 --> 05:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
and so the law allows us to um
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know if we are unable to return that
 
05:03:18.310 --> 05:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
property after three years
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
those funds can be as cheated to county
 
05:03:21.360 --> 05:03:22.628 align:start position:0%
those funds can be as cheated to county
treasurers

05:03:22.628 --> 05:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
treasurers
 
05:03:22.638 --> 05:03:23.430 align:start position:0%
treasurers
and

05:03:23.430 --> 05:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
the rest to the general fund so
 
05:03:28.150 --> 05:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 um
 
05:03:30.628 --> 05:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
this is a calculation that we use
 
05:03:30.638 --> 05:03:32.470 align:start position:0%
this is a calculation that we use
and

05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:34.868 --> 05:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
this is the the reported amount
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 17 was 12 million
 
05:03:38.400 --> 05:03:39.990 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 17 was 12 million
then

05:03:39.990 --> 05:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:03:42.230 --> 05:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
we are also able to liquidate
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
the securities that we receive that was
 
05:03:48.070 --> 05:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
2.9 million we were able to subtract the
 
05:03:50.470 --> 05:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
minister of expenses for the program
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
and also deduct the county payments so
 
05:03:56.470 --> 05:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 we um
 
05:03:56.480 --> 05:03:57.350 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 we um
uh

05:03:57.350 --> 05:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:03:58.708 --> 05:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
we returned to a general fund
 
05:04:01.750 --> 05:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 11.7 million
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
so i think in the past what uh what i've
 
05:04:07.350 --> 05:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh to this committee is
 
05:04:07.360 --> 05:04:08.150 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh to this committee is
we

05:04:08.150 --> 05:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:04:08.160 --> 05:04:09.670 align:start position:0%
we
we

05:04:09.670 --> 05:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:04:12.550 --> 05:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
we have a way we we know already
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
we have a way to estimate how much we
 
05:04:16.708 --> 05:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
potentially could achieve to the general
 
05:04:16.718 --> 05:04:17.590 align:start position:0%
potentially could achieve to the general
fund

05:04:17.590 --> 05:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:04:20.470 --> 05:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
because we know
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
how much we have received in a
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
particular fiscal year
 
05:04:26.788 --> 05:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
and in the average that we return we
 
05:04:29.110 --> 05:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
return each year
 
05:04:31.350 --> 05:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
so the typical unknown is
 
05:04:33.030 --> 05:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
is the amount of securities that we
 
05:04:35.110 --> 05:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
liquidate so when we liquidate
 
05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
securities we have
 
05:04:39.510 --> 05:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
a certain number of securities that we
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
we're about to liquidate but it really
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
depends on the market and the capital
 
05:04:45.590 --> 05:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
markets at the time we sell those
 
05:04:45.600 --> 05:04:46.868 align:start position:0%
markets at the time we sell those
securities

05:04:46.868 --> 05:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
securities
 
05:04:46.878 --> 05:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
securities
um

05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
how much we're going to really receive
 
05:04:52.628 --> 05:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal year 20 unfortunately was
 
05:04:54.230 --> 05:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
years that the market was not performing
 
05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
well because it was about the time
 
05:04:59.280 --> 05:05:00.470 align:start position:0%
well because it was about the time
when

05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
when we had the downturn in the market
 
05:05:06.070 --> 05:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
in um so unfortunately at that time we
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
receive less that we will normally
 
05:05:08.000 --> 05:05:09.030 align:start position:0%
receive less that we will normally
receive

05:05:09.030 --> 05:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
receive
 
05:05:09.040 --> 05:05:11.350 align:start position:0%
receive
however

05:05:11.350 --> 05:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:05:14.150 --> 05:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
we we do not time the market so we have
 
05:05:16.550 --> 05:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
some years that we are also able to
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
benefit from a bull market so and that
 
05:05:22.310 --> 05:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
is is probably shown better in the next
 
05:05:25.990 --> 05:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
couple of slides so this slide
 
05:05:27.910 --> 05:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
also shows the activity over the last 10
 
05:05:29.830 --> 05:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
years that we we have as cheetah to the
 
05:05:33.990 --> 05:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
general fund and the top chart shows um
 
05:05:37.030 --> 05:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
what we remem uh what relates to the
 
05:05:39.350 --> 05:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
the cash that we receive from
 
05:05:39.360 --> 05:05:40.070 align:start position:0%
the cash that we receive from
from

05:05:40.070 --> 05:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:05:43.110 --> 05:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
institutional holders um and the the
 
05:05:45.030 --> 05:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
table and the bottoms really shows how
 
05:05:46.948 --> 05:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
much we've been able to liquidate
 
05:05:49.510 --> 05:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
um those the the proceeds from those uh
 
05:05:52.550 --> 05:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
securely with securities liquidations
 
05:05:55.910 --> 05:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
um so again in 2020 it wasn't it wasn't
 
05:05:58.310 --> 05:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
a very good year for for this type of
 
05:06:02.470 --> 05:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
proceeds uh but for example in 2014
 
05:06:05.830 --> 05:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
um 2018 2018 we were able to take
 
05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
advantage of the values of
 
05:06:10.470 --> 05:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
the the fair market value of those
 
05:06:10.480 --> 05:06:15.190 align:start position:0%
the the fair market value of those
properties

05:06:15.190 --> 05:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:16.868 --> 05:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
so the
 
05:06:19.270 --> 05:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
next chart really shows how much we have
 
05:06:22.830 --> 05:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
in total uh limited to the general fund
 
05:06:25.750 --> 05:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
um i think i am covering my own notes
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
there um so over the past 10 years the
 
05:06:31.510 --> 05:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
division has us cheated i'm sorry
 
05:06:33.670 --> 05:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
the division has exceeded approximately
 
05:06:36.390 --> 05:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
140 million to the general fund which is
 
05:06:38.470 --> 05:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
an average of 14 million
 
05:06:41.750 --> 05:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:43.750 --> 05:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
so so with that information we're able
 
05:06:46.868 --> 05:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
to uh at least project that in fiscal
 
05:06:48.708 --> 05:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
year 21
 
05:06:50.550 --> 05:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
we should be able to
 
05:06:54.070 --> 05:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
exchange approximately 17.3 million
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
um the same um
 
05:06:58.868 --> 05:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
for the upcoming budget and fiscal year
 
05:07:01.030 --> 05:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
22 and 23
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
we believe we could um we could exceed
 
05:07:08.628 --> 05:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
16.8 million and 22 and 18.4 million and
 
05:07:12.150 --> 05:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
23. and this this really is based on we
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
use a 10-year average for our
 
05:07:14.000 --> 05:07:15.270 align:start position:0%
use a 10-year average for our
projections

05:07:15.270 --> 05:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
projections
 
05:07:17.190 --> 05:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
and and it's based on information that
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
we already have how much we typically
 
05:07:19.440 --> 05:07:20.470 align:start position:0%
we already have how much we typically
return

05:07:20.470 --> 05:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
return
 
05:07:22.550 --> 05:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
to individuals and corporations each
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
year and that allows us to estimate
 
05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
these numbers that
 
05:07:38.628 --> 05:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:42.788 --> 05:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
okay well i uh with that information um
 
05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
i think i'll turn it over to director
 
05:07:44.958 --> 05:07:46.550 align:start position:0%
i think i'll turn it over to director
makanespi

05:07:46.550 --> 05:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
makanespi
 
05:07:48.628 --> 05:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
to provide us more details on the trends
 
05:07:50.948 --> 05:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
in initiatives before you do that could
 
05:07:52.948 --> 05:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
you explain
 
05:08:00.310 --> 05:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh the payments the county so
 
05:08:06.150 --> 05:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
we use the same process um is is
 
05:08:07.750 --> 05:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know i probably asked uh director
 
05:08:09.350 --> 05:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
mcconaughey to explain this a little
 
05:08:11.510 --> 05:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
more uh but it is the same process as
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
the cash that we have collected that
 
05:08:13.280 --> 05:08:14.310 align:start position:0%
the cash that we have collected that
relates

05:08:14.310 --> 05:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
relates
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
that um this is the piece that probably
 
05:08:19.910 --> 05:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
gonna need uh his assistance um the
 
05:08:22.150 --> 05:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
where the owners the last known address
 
05:08:23.830 --> 05:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the owners
 
05:08:25.350 --> 05:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
um are part of
 
05:08:28.070 --> 05:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
and and so if we are unable to return
 
05:08:30.788 --> 05:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
those funds to
 
05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
to those owners then the counties
 
05:08:33.440 --> 05:08:34.470 align:start position:0%
to those owners then the counties
receive

05:08:34.470 --> 05:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
receive
 
05:08:38.550 --> 05:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
we are able to um so once we achieve
 
05:08:43.350 --> 05:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
even to the general fund once we're able
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
to cheat to the county treasurer's and
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
also to a general fund an owner can an
 
05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
owner can always come come back to us
 
05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
and and request those funds we have the
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
05:08:57.510 --> 05:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
um to go back we we actually go to
 
05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
the governor and council for that
 
05:09:01.350 --> 05:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
approval and we're able to us
 
05:09:04.230 --> 05:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
essentially request those funds back
 
05:09:07.030 --> 05:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
and and so we we use that calculation in
 
05:09:08.150 --> 05:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
the same
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the county treasurer so if we have
 
05:09:11.830 --> 05:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
as cheated
 
05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
to them and if an owner and nona comes
 
05:09:17.270 --> 05:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
back to us requesting those funds we can
 
05:09:19.670 --> 05:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
take some of those funds back from those
 
05:09:19.680 --> 05:09:21.190 align:start position:0%
take some of those funds back from those
counties

05:09:21.190 --> 05:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
counties
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:28.310 --> 05:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
i'll probably ask tom for that tom can
 
05:09:37.350 --> 05:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:40.070 --> 05:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'm unable to see um because i'm sharing
 
05:09:46.070 --> 05:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
so i'll come back to us so so your
 
05:09:49.430 --> 05:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
question is
 
05:09:52.788 --> 05:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
um the percentage that we achieved
 
05:09:56.070 --> 05:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
right what percentage of the funds
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
you expect
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
to account let me let me go back okay
 
05:10:01.510 --> 05:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
he's on the call he just needs to unmute
 
05:10:01.520 --> 05:10:06.390 align:start position:0%
he's on the call he just needs to unmute
himself

05:10:06.390 --> 05:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:06.400 --> 05:10:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
yes this is tom mcinnesville
 
05:10:12.718 --> 05:10:14.390 align:start position:0%
yes this is tom mcinnesville
yes

05:10:14.390 --> 05:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:10:16.390 --> 05:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh it shows less county payments what
 
05:10:19.360 --> 05:10:20.550 align:start position:0%
uh it shows less county payments what
percentage

05:10:20.550 --> 05:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
05:10:23.670 --> 05:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
of the funds go to the county
 
05:10:25.350 --> 05:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's really not a set percentage what
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
happens is the statute states as part of
 
05:10:30.150 --> 05:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
the achievement after the achievement
 
05:10:30.160 --> 05:10:31.110 align:start position:0%
the achievement after the achievement
process

05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:10:33.190 --> 05:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
at the end of three years any property
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
that we receive that hasn't had a claim
 
05:10:38.070 --> 05:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
against it becomes that net amount
 
05:10:38.080 --> 05:10:39.350 align:start position:0%
against it becomes that net amount
remitted

05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
remitted
 
05:10:41.270 --> 05:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
for that particular year so it's the
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
money that we received three years ago
 
05:10:45.430 --> 05:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
but the law also allows so that's any
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
holder that has reported
 
05:10:50.470 --> 05:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
property to the state of new hampshire
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
um and that holder is located out of
 
05:10:53.280 --> 05:10:54.150 align:start position:0%
um and that holder is located out of
state

05:10:54.150 --> 05:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
if the holder is located in state then
 
05:10:59.510 --> 05:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
that same process that same is like a
 
05:11:01.590 --> 05:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
mini calculation that is done for each
 
05:11:05.110 --> 05:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
county based upon the amount of the that
 
05:11:07.030 --> 05:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
was that was reported from the holders
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
in their county and then claims against
 
05:11:09.440 --> 05:11:10.150 align:start position:0%
in their county and then claims against
it

05:11:10.150 --> 05:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:11:12.868 --> 05:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
a further part of that calculation is
 
05:11:14.470 --> 05:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
what happens is
 
05:11:16.390 --> 05:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the during that whole fiscal year
 
05:11:18.470 --> 05:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're also paying claims
 
05:11:20.150 --> 05:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
and when we're planning claims for items
 
05:11:22.070 --> 05:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
that we've had over three years
 
05:11:23.830 --> 05:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
we go to front of the governor's council
 
05:11:25.430 --> 05:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
and we have funds
 
05:11:26.948 --> 05:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
sent back to us
 
05:11:28.390 --> 05:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
from the general fund so we can pay
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
those claims for properties that we've
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
held over three years
 
05:11:34.390 --> 05:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
so in this case we then net that against
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
so it's almost like we're borrowing it
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
to make that county the county claim
 
05:11:40.868 --> 05:11:40.878 align:start position:0%
payment during the year but we're at the
 
05:11:42.788 --> 05:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
end of the fiscal year what we're
 
05:11:44.948 --> 05:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
ultimately going to send to the counties
 
05:11:47.190 --> 05:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
is also reduced by any claim that was
 
05:11:49.270 --> 05:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
paid as well but what they're getting
 
05:11:51.110 --> 05:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
they're getting the net of the the
 
05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
particular year like the the um
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
general fund the shipment calculation
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
example that monica has provided you
 
05:12:00.150 --> 05:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
that would have been property that we
 
05:12:02.948 --> 05:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
received in report year 2016.
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
so all of the monies that we received
 
05:12:09.670 --> 05:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
from in-state holders in 2016
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
that money that was not claimed instead
 
05:12:13.430 --> 05:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
of going to the general fund the statute
 
05:12:16.230 --> 05:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
requires that it goes back to
 
05:12:18.628 --> 05:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
the county from which that holder is
 
05:12:21.350 --> 05:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
where that holder is located
 
05:12:25.110 --> 05:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's about a 10 percent
 
05:12:25.120 --> 05:12:26.150 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's about a 10 percent
range

05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
range
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
is that but again but that's a one-year
 
05:12:31.350 --> 05:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
snapshot so it can fluctuate greatly and
 
05:12:33.670 --> 05:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
it can fluctuate greatly upon you know
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
claims that were made and then
 
05:12:37.670 --> 05:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
particular reports that were that were
 
05:12:40.868 --> 05:12:40.878 align:start position:0%
made as well and as you can imagine what
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
on the in-state um
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
on some of the ins on some of the uh
 
05:12:46.550 --> 05:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
in-state holders a lot of them the
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
in-state banks so if we have a rather
 
05:12:51.590 --> 05:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
large account that gets reported from
 
05:12:53.110 --> 05:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
you know any particular county that
 
05:12:55.590 --> 05:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
could really switch that one particular
 
05:12:55.600 --> 05:12:56.788 align:start position:0%
could really switch that one particular
year

05:12:56.788 --> 05:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:12:58.708 --> 05:12:58.718 align:start position:0%
um for that county
 
05:13:00.628 --> 05:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
you know for how that calculation is
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
done but
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i i guess that would be i mean most
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the things that we do uh year-to-year
 
05:13:09.030 --> 05:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
do seem to um
 
05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
stay basically uh very consistent but i
 
05:13:13.590 --> 05:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
say that would be a one-year snapshot so
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
you could never give it a percentage
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's just based upon the money that was
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
reported from those in in-state holders
 
05:13:21.430 --> 05:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
in that particular year
 
05:13:24.390 --> 05:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
let me ask you this could the county
 
05:13:27.190 --> 05:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
get any one year more than what the
 
05:13:28.868 --> 05:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
state gets
 
05:13:30.948 --> 05:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
no that would be impossible because
 
05:13:33.990 --> 05:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
the the uh what ends up happening is
 
05:13:36.390 --> 05:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of abandoned
 
05:13:38.310 --> 05:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
property that is reported to any given
 
05:13:38.320 --> 05:13:39.190 align:start position:0%
property that is reported to any given
state

05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:13:39.200 --> 05:13:40.070 align:start position:0%
state
um

05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
is typically from out of state holders
 
05:13:42.480 --> 05:13:44.788 align:start position:0%
is typically from out of state holders
right

05:13:44.788 --> 05:13:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
all of your national banks are
 
05:13:46.160 --> 05:13:47.350 align:start position:0%
all of your national banks are
considered

05:13:47.350 --> 05:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
considered
 
05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
national holders all of the securities
 
05:13:52.070 --> 05:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
we receive those are all those are all
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
national holders so the in-state holder
 
05:13:55.590 --> 05:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
portion is always going to be much
 
05:13:55.600 --> 05:13:57.270 align:start position:0%
portion is always going to be much
smaller

05:13:57.270 --> 05:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
05:14:00.230 --> 05:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
so of the in-state
 
05:14:00.240 --> 05:14:01.670 align:start position:0%
so of the in-state
money

05:14:01.670 --> 05:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:14:05.110 --> 05:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
would the county receive more money
 
05:14:05.120 --> 05:14:06.470 align:start position:0%
would the county receive more money
than

05:14:06.470 --> 05:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:14:08.948 --> 05:14:08.958 align:start position:0%
what the state would get
 
05:14:10.390 --> 05:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
that no that would never
 
05:14:13.110 --> 05:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
that would never happen
 
05:14:13.120 --> 05:14:14.310 align:start position:0%
that would never happen
the

05:14:14.310 --> 05:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:14.320 --> 05:14:15.190 align:start position:0%
the
the

05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:14:17.670 --> 05:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
the because there's always going to be
 
05:14:19.350 --> 05:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
so if you look at any given year when
 
05:14:21.110 --> 05:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
one when the treasurer showed those
 
05:14:23.590 --> 05:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
slides we're averaging 17 million
 
05:14:23.600 --> 05:14:24.708 align:start position:0%
slides we're averaging 17 million
dollars

05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:14:24.718 --> 05:14:26.150 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
17 to 20 million dollars that we receive
 
05:14:31.190 --> 05:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
in any given year
 
05:14:33.830 --> 05:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
upward to 75 to 80 percent of that is
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
always going to be reported from an out
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
of state holder so that's going to be
 
05:14:39.910 --> 05:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
the driving force in that calculation is
 
05:14:42.310 --> 05:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
that amount that was reported so the
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
amount that's ultimately achieved to the
 
05:14:47.750 --> 05:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
general fund is always going to
 
05:14:49.910 --> 05:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
foster past what was what is given to
 
05:14:51.990 --> 05:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
any individual county all the counties
 
05:14:54.310 --> 05:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
in total
 
05:14:55.990 --> 05:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's all right we'll
 
05:14:59.670 --> 05:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:59.680 --> 05:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:15:00.550 --> 05:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:03.430 --> 05:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative romney has a question
 
05:15:04.868 --> 05:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think i'm off speaking yep um
 
05:15:11.750 --> 05:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
what happens uh you liquidated security
 
05:15:13.990 --> 05:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and it's a cheated
 
05:15:16.310 --> 05:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
back to the state uh what happens two
 
05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
years from now that point and they come
 
05:15:20.550 --> 05:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
someone comes to claim that money or
 
05:15:23.030 --> 05:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
that those stocks let's say
 
05:15:25.190 --> 05:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
do they get paid what the liquidation
 
05:15:28.830 --> 05:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:28.840 --> 05:15:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
yes right tom yes yes but what happens
 
05:15:35.750 --> 05:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
the statue requires that we have to hold
 
05:15:38.070 --> 05:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
securities for at least one year
 
05:15:39.830 --> 05:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
if we sold them if we sold any
 
05:15:39.840 --> 05:15:41.110 align:start position:0%
if we sold them if we sold any
securities

05:15:41.110 --> 05:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
securities
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
um prior to in the end of one year
 
05:15:46.550 --> 05:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
the person would be entitled to whatever
 
05:15:49.190 --> 05:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
the stock was trading at at present or
 
05:15:51.430 --> 05:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
what we received as long as we go beyond
 
05:15:52.948 --> 05:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
that one year and we do stand beyond
 
05:15:54.628 --> 05:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
that we wait for that three year period
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
we always have a three year period we
 
05:15:56.638 --> 05:15:57.670 align:start position:0%
we always have a three year period we
are

05:15:57.670 --> 05:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
we we we pay whatever we receive for the
 
05:16:03.510 --> 05:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
security for the um
 
05:16:05.670 --> 05:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
liquidation of that security and eating
 
05:16:08.230 --> 05:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
dividends that were associated with that
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh during the period that we held it so
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
the person has made 100 whole from what
 
05:16:15.110 --> 05:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
we received
 
05:16:16.788 --> 05:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
okay but it doesn't it doesn't after
 
05:16:18.948 --> 05:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
that date it doesn't that bad doesn't go
 
05:16:20.948 --> 05:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
up and down it you you put it as long as
 
05:16:22.868 --> 05:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
we don't as long as we don't sell before
 
05:16:24.550 --> 05:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
a one-year period if we ever got into
 
05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
the act of selling and you obviously
 
05:16:28.150 --> 05:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
never want to do that but if we ever did
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
solo security uh within one year we
 
05:16:31.910 --> 05:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:16:31.920 --> 05:16:33.270 align:start position:0%
would be
um

05:16:33.270 --> 05:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:35.430 --> 05:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
until that pro when that person ever
 
05:16:37.590 --> 05:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
came forward we would have this we would
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
have to provide them
 
05:16:40.948 --> 05:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
whatever we received or what it's
 
05:16:42.470 --> 05:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
presently trading for whichever is
 
05:16:42.480 --> 05:16:43.990 align:start position:0%
presently trading for whichever is
greater

05:16:43.990 --> 05:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
greater
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
by the way for the new members i've been
 
05:16:47.830 --> 05:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
doing this is my sixth budget
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
i never knew part of this went to the
 
05:16:49.200 --> 05:16:50.070 align:start position:0%
i never knew part of this went to the
county

05:16:50.070 --> 05:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
county
 
05:16:51.910 --> 05:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
in all these years so learn something
 
05:16:55.270 --> 05:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
new every every time thank you
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:01.830 --> 05:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman um my question
 
05:17:05.270 --> 05:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
is when you liquidate stocks
 
05:17:07.510 --> 05:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
is there any federal capital gains tax
 
05:17:07.520 --> 05:17:10.150 align:start position:0%
is there any federal capital gains tax
owed

05:17:10.150 --> 05:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:10.160 --> 05:17:12.868 align:start position:0%
 
no

05:17:12.868 --> 05:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:16.470 --> 05:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
the the what what would happen again we
 
05:17:18.230 --> 05:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
some we would sometimes have that
 
05:17:18.240 --> 05:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
some we would sometimes have that
question

05:17:19.110 --> 05:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:17:20.948 --> 05:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
we're not paying any we're not paying
 
05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
any um
 
05:17:25.030 --> 05:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
well well two things are on there one
 
05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
any payment that we
 
05:17:29.430 --> 05:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
on the liquidation we are only receiving
 
05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
what what they received so a person
 
05:17:35.350 --> 05:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
typically may ask us do i have
 
05:17:38.150 --> 05:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
do i have any tax liability on this
 
05:17:39.910 --> 05:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
we can't give them that information
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
again that they would have to go back
 
05:17:43.110 --> 05:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
what we received
 
05:17:44.868 --> 05:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
they would have to make a determination
 
05:17:46.628 --> 05:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
based upon what they initially purchased
 
05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
for but it's nothing that we're involved
 
05:17:48.240 --> 05:17:49.030 align:start position:0%
for but it's nothing that we're involved
with

05:17:49.030 --> 05:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:17:50.550 --> 05:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
in the three-year period where we're
 
05:17:53.590 --> 05:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
holding stock and a claim is made
 
05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
um our custodian makes that payment so
 
05:17:58.470 --> 05:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
if a person comes forward and says that
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
they are claiming shares that we're
 
05:18:01.750 --> 05:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
holding they're given the right in that
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
three-year period when we still hold
 
05:18:04.390 --> 05:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
them in sheer form
 
05:18:05.830 --> 05:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're given that right to either claim
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
the stock in share form or have our
 
05:18:10.628 --> 05:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
custodian liquidate them liquidate it
 
05:18:11.590 --> 05:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
for them
 
05:18:13.830 --> 05:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
if they choose the liquidation
 
05:18:16.310 --> 05:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
our custodian does issue them at 1099
 
05:18:18.310 --> 05:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
and there is a taxable event there but
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
we are not involved with that either
 
05:18:22.390 --> 05:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
in the period there during the three
 
05:18:24.628 --> 05:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
years that we hold it in sheer form or
 
05:18:28.470 --> 05:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
after we hold after the liquidation
 
05:18:30.868 --> 05:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:18:35.350 --> 05:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:37.670 --> 05:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see any is there anything else
 
05:18:39.750 --> 05:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about the
 
05:18:42.550 --> 05:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:44.390 --> 05:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so at this point i think alternate
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
i turn uh i turn it over to tom for uh
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
to provide us more uh details of what um
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
some of the trends and initiatives that
 
05:18:54.470 --> 05:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
might be coming
 
05:18:59.590 --> 05:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um so what what we are
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
actually seeing um
 
05:19:06.628 --> 05:19:06.638 align:start position:0%
with the trends i wanted to touch upon
 
05:19:08.708 --> 05:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
the the just to give a backwater the
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
broad areas and monica touched upon it
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
for us the broad areas of that we're
 
05:19:15.030 --> 05:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
receiving and we classify holders into
 
05:19:18.070 --> 05:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
three general areas one is
 
05:19:20.310 --> 05:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
um miscellaneous which is really a
 
05:19:22.390 --> 05:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
catch-all for all our holders includes
 
05:19:24.788 --> 05:19:24.798 align:start position:0%
all of the banks the transfer agents any
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
companies uh reporting um payroll checks
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
was any
 
05:19:31.990 --> 05:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
most of our holders fall in that
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous category then we have the
 
05:19:35.830 --> 05:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
government category and the insurance
 
05:19:35.840 --> 05:19:37.110 align:start position:0%
government category and the insurance
category

05:19:37.110 --> 05:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
category
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh miscellaneous and government they
 
05:19:40.788 --> 05:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
have a reporting deadline that is
 
05:19:42.948 --> 05:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
november 1st of each year
 
05:19:44.868 --> 05:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies actually have a
 
05:19:44.878 --> 05:19:45.910 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies actually have a
separate

05:19:45.910 --> 05:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
separate
 
05:19:48.070 --> 05:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
reporting deadline that's made for us
 
05:19:49.750 --> 05:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
and that's typically they do report
 
05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
other items um during that insurance
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
deadline but that is typically where
 
05:19:56.550 --> 05:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
we're receiving the death benefits
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
insurance death benefits and that's
 
05:19:58.798 --> 05:20:00.470 align:start position:0%
insurance death benefits and that's
probably

05:20:00.470 --> 05:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
probably
 
05:20:02.788 --> 05:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
the uh out of those three areas
 
05:20:05.590 --> 05:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
again i'd say you know year to year
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
much of what we receive what we're
 
05:20:09.430 --> 05:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
paying out seems to be very consistent
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
the one area where there continues to be
 
05:20:14.470 --> 05:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit some growth is in those
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
death benefits and that's because the
 
05:20:18.310 --> 05:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
states took an initiative
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
ten years ago and working with our
 
05:20:23.030 --> 05:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
various audit companies
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
felt that the insurance companies
 
05:20:26.230 --> 05:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
although they reported a great deal of
 
05:20:28.150 --> 05:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property they were under
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
reporting unclaimed property for death
 
05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
benefits where
 
05:20:34.390 --> 05:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
their records actually showed the
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
insured was had passed away
 
05:20:38.788 --> 05:20:38.798 align:start position:0%
but they were they were relying on a
 
05:20:40.230 --> 05:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
provision that said if they didn't
 
05:20:41.990 --> 05:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
actually have a claim against those
 
05:20:44.150 --> 05:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
funds they didn't have to report it to
 
05:20:46.628 --> 05:20:46.638 align:start position:0%
an individual state until three years
 
05:20:48.628 --> 05:20:48.638 align:start position:0%
after the insured would have reached the
 
05:20:50.628 --> 05:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
age of 99.
 
05:20:52.948 --> 05:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
so those audits um
 
05:20:54.550 --> 05:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
showed that that was not the proper way
 
05:20:55.430 --> 05:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
05:20:56.948 --> 05:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
it showed that the insurance companies
 
05:20:59.110 --> 05:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
had that information they knew that they
 
05:21:00.550 --> 05:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
had many of the insurers who had passed
 
05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
away and that has greatly enhanced the
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
reporting and the insurance
 
05:21:06.868 --> 05:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
death benefit area and i think that's so
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
that's probably one area that
 
05:21:11.030 --> 05:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
remains strong and there could still
 
05:21:12.788 --> 05:21:12.798 align:start position:0%
continue to be a little growth in that
 
05:21:15.750 --> 05:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
particular area moving forward
 
05:21:17.750 --> 05:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh generally just to give you a sense
 
05:21:19.830 --> 05:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
also touched upon the five largest
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
reporting uh
 
05:21:24.150 --> 05:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
properties that we receive by type
 
05:21:24.160 --> 05:21:25.510 align:start position:0%
properties that we receive by type
um

05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:27.990 --> 05:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
and they are the greatest uh amount of
 
05:21:29.830 --> 05:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
property that we receive
 
05:21:31.990 --> 05:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh during the last four years but all in
 
05:21:34.150 --> 05:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
any particular year it's usually tied up
 
05:21:36.150 --> 05:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
in a savings account
 
05:21:37.990 --> 05:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a dormancy period of
 
05:21:40.550 --> 05:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
five years which is a very fair dormancy
 
05:21:40.560 --> 05:21:41.510 align:start position:0%
five years which is a very fair dormancy
period

05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
period
 
05:21:43.430 --> 05:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh five years at the end of a five year
 
05:21:45.910 --> 05:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
period that's something more typically
 
05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
more than a rainy day fund that someone
 
05:21:49.990 --> 05:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
may have forgot about other states have
 
05:21:51.750 --> 05:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
two years and three years dormancy
 
05:21:53.110 --> 05:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
period for
 
05:21:54.948 --> 05:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
for bank uh bank accounts and i think
 
05:21:56.628 --> 05:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
that that um
 
05:21:58.708 --> 05:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
can sometimes upset the account holder
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
because they really did have that set
 
05:22:02.230 --> 05:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
aside for an emergency and and they're
 
05:22:03.910 --> 05:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
not happy that it was moved after a
 
05:22:05.670 --> 05:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
period of just three years
 
05:22:07.830 --> 05:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh vendor checks are a
 
05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
another large
 
05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh property type to receive and that's a
 
05:22:14.230 --> 05:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
vendor check it's it's typically would
 
05:22:16.150 --> 05:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
you think of it as a check payable to
 
05:22:17.430 --> 05:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
another business
 
05:22:20.230 --> 05:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
but vendor checks a lot of um
 
05:22:22.550 --> 05:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
when they code the property type a lot
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
of holders many entities actually
 
05:22:26.150 --> 05:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
consider a vendor check payable to
 
05:22:28.470 --> 05:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
anyone who's not one of their employees
 
05:22:30.070 --> 05:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
one of their employees so that white
 
05:22:32.070 --> 05:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
drives the vendor checks
 
05:22:34.788 --> 05:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
because we receive so many securities we
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
do receive a great deal of dividends and
 
05:22:37.440 --> 05:22:39.190 align:start position:0%
do receive a great deal of dividends and
dividends

05:22:39.190 --> 05:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
05:22:41.110 --> 05:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
dividends actually drive the dormancy
 
05:22:42.868 --> 05:22:42.878 align:start position:0%
period for securities
 
05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
so many people that receive small
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
dividend checks um
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
you know they're almost considered a
 
05:22:51.750 --> 05:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
nuisance especially in this day and age
 
05:22:53.830 --> 05:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
when people don't go to the bank quite
 
05:22:55.430 --> 05:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
as often as they use if they receive a
 
05:22:58.708 --> 05:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
dollar 20 or a dollar 30 dividend check
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
they put it aside and they don't do
 
05:23:01.510 --> 05:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
anything with it if they do that for
 
05:23:02.948 --> 05:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
three years
 
05:23:05.510 --> 05:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
the transfer agent then is supposed to
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
consider that account dormant
 
05:23:09.670 --> 05:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
and not only transfer the dividends but
 
05:23:11.670 --> 05:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
transfer the securities that produce the
 
05:23:11.680 --> 05:23:12.708 align:start position:0%
transfer the securities that produce the
dividends

05:23:12.708 --> 05:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
05:23:15.430 --> 05:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why there's so many dividends
 
05:23:16.708 --> 05:23:16.718 align:start position:0%
that's why it's very important for
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
people if they do get those small checks
 
05:23:18.480 --> 05:23:19.350 align:start position:0%
people if they do get those small checks
um

05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:20.948 --> 05:23:20.958 align:start position:0%
dividend checks to make sure they take
 
05:23:23.030 --> 05:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
the time to cash them insurance death
 
05:23:24.550 --> 05:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
benefits is up to number four i could
 
05:23:27.030 --> 05:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
see that moving forward
 
05:23:29.270 --> 05:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
and uh checking accounts again it's just
 
05:23:30.550 --> 05:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
the same thing with the savings accounts
 
05:23:32.550 --> 05:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
but again it's at that same what i
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
consider a very fair five-year dormancy
 
05:23:35.360 --> 05:23:36.550 align:start position:0%
consider a very fair five-year dormancy
period

05:23:36.550 --> 05:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
period
 
05:23:37.910 --> 05:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to give you that as a
 
05:23:40.070 --> 05:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
background of the property types and the
 
05:23:40.080 --> 05:23:41.110 align:start position:0%
background of the property types and the
general

05:23:41.110 --> 05:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
type of entities that we receive
 
05:23:44.550 --> 05:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
property from
 
05:23:48.390 --> 05:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
so there are some new initiatives that
 
05:23:50.550 --> 05:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
may result in
 
05:23:52.628 --> 05:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
more property being reported
 
05:23:54.628 --> 05:23:54.638 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming cycles
 
05:23:54.638 --> 05:23:55.590 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming cycles
um

05:23:55.590 --> 05:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
and some of it is there's
 
05:23:57.840 --> 05:23:59.190 align:start position:0%
and some of it is there's
a

05:23:59.190 --> 05:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
we're looking for we're looking to work
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the federal government for
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
resolutions for two major
 
05:24:04.000 --> 05:24:05.270 align:start position:0%
resolutions for two major
areas

05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
areas
 
05:24:06.390 --> 05:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
that have
 
05:24:08.550 --> 05:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
incredible amounts of unclaimed property
 
05:24:10.948 --> 05:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
but it's hard to get to a resolution
 
05:24:12.310 --> 05:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
because the federal government doesn't
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
want to give up
 
05:24:16.230 --> 05:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
the um the money that they're holding
 
05:24:17.350 --> 05:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:24:17.360 --> 05:24:18.230 align:start position:0%
and then
if

05:24:18.230 --> 05:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:24:19.750 --> 05:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
so would get to that when i talk about
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
those um the retirement council saving
 
05:24:23.670 --> 05:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
bond but first
 
05:24:26.550 --> 05:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
touch base upon um
 
05:24:28.470 --> 05:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
electronic currencies bitcoin
 
05:24:31.110 --> 05:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies that's becoming a very
 
05:24:32.708 --> 05:24:32.718 align:start position:0%
big emerging issue
 
05:24:35.430 --> 05:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
in unclaimed property and it it really
 
05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
starts with
 
05:24:38.070 --> 05:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
two schools of thought in the holder
 
05:24:40.868 --> 05:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
community the holders of uh bitcoin and
 
05:24:43.110 --> 05:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency one school of thought
 
05:24:46.310 --> 05:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
there is they want the states to take it
 
05:24:48.070 --> 05:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
because now they've been in existence
 
05:24:49.910 --> 05:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
long enough they have some very old
 
05:24:52.070 --> 05:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
dormant accounts they don't want to hold
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
them and they would like to
 
05:24:55.750 --> 05:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
find a resolution of a way of moving
 
05:24:57.430 --> 05:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
that so they'd like the stakes to hold
 
05:24:57.440 --> 05:24:58.150 align:start position:0%
that so they'd like the stakes to hold
it

05:24:58.150 --> 05:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:25:00.150 --> 05:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
you have other holders in that community
 
05:25:02.070 --> 05:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
that are fighting and saying that
 
05:25:04.150 --> 05:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property laws are not specific
 
05:25:04.160 --> 05:25:05.190 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property laws are not specific
enough

05:25:05.190 --> 05:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
enough
 
05:25:07.270 --> 05:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
if they don't specifically have a
 
05:25:09.030 --> 05:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
property type listed as
 
05:25:10.948 --> 05:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
an electronic currency
 
05:25:13.430 --> 05:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be able to rely on their
 
05:25:15.190 --> 05:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
catch-all provision which says any other
 
05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
tangible property
 
05:25:18.628 --> 05:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
should be reported if it meets that
 
05:25:20.628 --> 05:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
dormancy period
 
05:25:22.150 --> 05:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
on the flip side of that you have the
 
05:25:23.990 --> 05:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
states also have two different schools
 
05:25:25.350 --> 05:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
of thought out there
 
05:25:27.910 --> 05:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
and one of them is some states say we'll
 
05:25:30.470 --> 05:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
take cryptocurrency from you but you
 
05:25:33.030 --> 05:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
have to convert it into u.s dollars
 
05:25:33.040 --> 05:25:34.470 align:start position:0%
have to convert it into u.s dollars
first

05:25:34.470 --> 05:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
the other states say well
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
similar to stock it could be an
 
05:25:40.470 --> 05:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
investment so it would probably be wrong
 
05:25:43.030 --> 05:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
for us that to state that you needed to
 
05:25:44.868 --> 05:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
convert that before you report it to us
 
05:25:47.110 --> 05:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
because you should be able to
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
at least have it for a limited period of
 
05:25:50.868 --> 05:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
time like the three years with the
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
shares of stock have a right to claim
 
05:25:55.270 --> 05:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
what you actually on the property that
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
that had gone dormant
 
05:26:00.470 --> 05:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
we we use a custodian for our securities
 
05:26:03.110 --> 05:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
has seen this as an issue
 
05:26:05.110 --> 05:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
and they have taken the initiative they
 
05:26:07.030 --> 05:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
are in the position now
 
05:26:09.430 --> 05:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
that the states that they provide those
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
custodial services for securities
 
05:26:16.070 --> 05:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
not too far into 2021 they will be able
 
05:26:17.910 --> 05:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
to provide that same
 
05:26:17.920 --> 05:26:19.110 align:start position:0%
to provide that same
um

05:26:19.110 --> 05:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
custodial services to actually take in
 
05:26:24.070 --> 05:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
the cryptocurrencies in their in their
 
05:26:25.510 --> 05:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
native form
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
so that's a good thing if we were to
 
05:26:29.350 --> 05:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
pursue that avenue
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
also speaking with one of the audit
 
05:26:33.590 --> 05:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
firms that we use today
 
05:26:33.600 --> 05:26:34.470 align:start position:0%
firms that we use today
they

05:26:34.470 --> 05:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:26:36.150 --> 05:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
informed me that
 
05:26:37.270 --> 05:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
they would also be
 
05:26:37.280 --> 05:26:39.270 align:start position:0%
they would also be
[Music]

05:26:39.270 --> 05:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:26:40.708 --> 05:26:40.718 align:start position:0%
going to the states that they have
 
05:26:42.788 --> 05:26:42.798 align:start position:0%
contracts with and
 
05:26:45.030 --> 05:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
um seeing if they would like to join on
 
05:26:47.590 --> 05:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
with some of the larger cryptocurrency
 
05:26:49.670 --> 05:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
holders on examinations that would
 
05:26:54.628 --> 05:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:57.350 --> 05:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
the next big area is uh uncashed
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
retirement plant checks
 
05:27:00.240 --> 05:27:01.190 align:start position:0%
retirement plant checks
uh

05:27:01.190 --> 05:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:02.868 --> 05:27:02.878 align:start position:0%
there is
 
05:27:05.110 --> 05:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
estimates that there are
 
05:27:07.190 --> 05:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the vicinity of a hundred
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars within the united states
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis
 
05:27:11.840 --> 05:27:13.670 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis
of

05:27:13.670 --> 05:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:27:16.070 --> 05:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
private retirement checks
 
05:27:19.830 --> 05:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh private retirement um
 
05:27:19.840 --> 05:27:21.270 align:start position:0%
uh private retirement um
accounts

05:27:21.270 --> 05:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
their checks going uncached
 
05:27:24.868 --> 05:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:27:26.708 --> 05:27:26.718 align:start position:0%
department of labor the united states
 
05:27:28.628 --> 05:27:28.638 align:start position:0%
department of labor sees it as an issue
 
05:27:30.310 --> 05:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
they want to work with the states doing
 
05:27:30.320 --> 05:27:31.430 align:start position:0%
they want to work with the states doing
that

05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:33.350 --> 05:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
um but there is
 
05:27:35.430 --> 05:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's always been
 
05:27:35.440 --> 05:27:36.708 align:start position:0%
there's always been
a

05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:27:39.190 --> 05:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
line drawn with the federal government
 
05:27:39.200 --> 05:27:40.150 align:start position:0%
line drawn with the federal government
on

05:27:40.150 --> 05:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:27:40.160 --> 05:27:41.350 align:start position:0%
on
on

05:27:41.350 --> 05:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:27:43.670 --> 05:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
the uh private retirement accounts
 
05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
saying that they have protection under
 
05:27:47.350 --> 05:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
the erisa act and because they are
 
05:27:49.830 --> 05:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
governed by the erisa act un state
 
05:27:52.390 --> 05:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property laws do not
 
05:27:52.400 --> 05:27:53.270 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property laws do not
um

05:27:53.270 --> 05:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
do not apply to them because of that
 
05:27:56.310 --> 05:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
05:27:59.350 --> 05:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
because of the the erisa act um in this
 
05:28:01.670 --> 05:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
particular case you do have similar to
 
05:28:03.030 --> 05:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
what there was elected they are
 
05:28:04.948 --> 05:28:04.958 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency holders some of the
 
05:28:07.590 --> 05:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
holders say yeah we know that but can we
 
05:28:09.510 --> 05:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
we'd like to do it on a volunteer basis
 
05:28:11.750 --> 05:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
because voluntary basis because this is
 
05:28:12.948 --> 05:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
the only way we're going to be able to
 
05:28:15.270 --> 05:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
clean this up and they may the states
 
05:28:15.280 --> 05:28:16.390 align:start position:0%
clean this up and they may the states
have

05:28:16.390 --> 05:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:28:18.150 --> 05:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
a higher potential of being able to
 
05:28:20.070 --> 05:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
return the property to either to the to
 
05:28:22.310 --> 05:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
the retiree or in many of these
 
05:28:25.030 --> 05:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
instances i think it would be to the um
 
05:28:28.470 --> 05:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
the ears of the uh of the retiree
 
05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
and the us department of labor has
 
05:28:31.430 --> 05:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
recognized this
 
05:28:33.110 --> 05:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
they they've said that it's a problem
 
05:28:35.350 --> 05:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
going back to the onset of erisa back in
 
05:28:35.360 --> 05:28:36.868 align:start position:0%
going back to the onset of erisa back in
1974

05:28:36.868 --> 05:28:36.878 align:start position:0%
1974
 
05:28:39.510 --> 05:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a you know
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
40 somewhat year problem that needs to
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
be resolved one of the things they're
 
05:28:45.750 --> 05:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
thinking of or working towards is having
 
05:28:47.270 --> 05:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
because the
 
05:28:50.788 --> 05:28:50.798 align:start position:0%
all the small retirement um
 
05:28:52.310 --> 05:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
small retirement
 
05:28:54.310 --> 05:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
accounts or small retirement plans say
 
05:28:56.868 --> 05:28:56.878 align:start position:0%
that they don't want to report to all 50
 
05:28:58.788 --> 05:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
states so we're working the states are
 
05:29:00.070 --> 05:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
working to see if we can have a
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
clearinghouse they could report to the
 
05:29:03.190 --> 05:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
clearinghouse and then that
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
clearinghouse would report the money out
 
05:29:06.948 --> 05:29:06.958 align:start position:0%
to the individual state of the lawson
 
05:29:09.110 --> 05:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
address so that particular one seems to
 
05:29:11.510 --> 05:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
have more traction that
 
05:29:13.190 --> 05:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
via you know great resolution it would
 
05:29:15.750 --> 05:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
be you know additional compliance on
 
05:29:17.030 --> 05:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
property laws
 
05:29:17.040 --> 05:29:17.990 align:start position:0%
property laws
um

05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:20.150 --> 05:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
a chance to get those untaxed checks
 
05:29:21.670 --> 05:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
back to the family members of people
 
05:29:23.750 --> 05:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
that didn't uh get to use them during
 
05:29:24.948 --> 05:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
their lifetime or if they're still
 
05:29:26.788 --> 05:29:26.798 align:start position:0%
living getting back to them
 
05:29:28.548 --> 05:29:28.558 align:start position:0%
the next one united states savings bonds
 
05:29:30.230 --> 05:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
is just a flip side of that this is
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
something that
 
05:29:33.110 --> 05:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:29:34.708 --> 05:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
states have trying to been trying to
 
05:29:38.230 --> 05:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
resolve with the united states treasury
 
05:29:38.240 --> 05:29:39.270 align:start position:0%
resolve with the united states treasury
for

05:29:39.270 --> 05:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:29:42.150 --> 05:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
30 somewhat uh 30-some odd years and it
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
it just it just moves back and forth and
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
it never gets resolved and it's all
 
05:29:47.910 --> 05:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
based upon
 
05:29:49.910 --> 05:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
the there's just so much money there
 
05:29:51.350 --> 05:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
there this the
 
05:29:53.910 --> 05:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
the estimates
 
05:29:57.510 --> 05:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
the present estimates um
 
05:29:59.670 --> 05:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
on the on the us
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
shave on
 
05:30:03.510 --> 05:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
the fully matured
 
05:30:05.590 --> 05:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
unredeemed united states savings the
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
bonds is 26 billion dollars
 
05:30:11.030 --> 05:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
and of that 26 billion dollars
 
05:30:14.628 --> 05:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
96 million dollars of it is estimated to
 
05:30:14.638 --> 05:30:15.350 align:start position:0%
96 million dollars of it is estimated to
be

05:30:15.350 --> 05:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:30:17.110 --> 05:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
owed to
 
05:30:17.120 --> 05:30:18.150 align:start position:0%
owed to
um

05:30:18.150 --> 05:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:20.470 --> 05:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
bond holders that when they purchase
 
05:30:22.310 --> 05:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
them purchase them from a new hampshire
 
05:30:22.320 --> 05:30:24.628 align:start position:0%
them purchase them from a new hampshire
address

05:30:24.628 --> 05:30:24.638 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:30:26.150 --> 05:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
so what has happened that's moved back
 
05:30:27.190 --> 05:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
and forth
 
05:30:29.110 --> 05:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
the many of the states try to have a
 
05:30:31.590 --> 05:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
legislative fix that where
 
05:30:33.510 --> 05:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
they would recognize that the savings
 
05:30:35.350 --> 05:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
bonds that were
 
05:30:35.360 --> 05:30:36.230 align:start position:0%
bonds that were
um

05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:39.190 --> 05:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
registered to hold us within their state
 
05:30:40.788 --> 05:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
we would have the right to
 
05:30:40.798 --> 05:30:41.830 align:start position:0%
we would have the right to
petition

05:30:41.830 --> 05:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
petition
 
05:30:43.510 --> 05:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
the legislative the legislature passed
 
05:30:45.990 --> 05:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
this five years ago saying and we joined
 
05:30:47.990 --> 05:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
other states and saying that
 
05:30:49.990 --> 05:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
we could advertise and then if we
 
05:30:51.910 --> 05:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't find them having got that
 
05:30:53.510 --> 05:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
information with the united states
 
05:30:55.750 --> 05:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
department of treasury we would petition
 
05:30:55.760 --> 05:30:57.430 align:start position:0%
department of treasury we would petition
the

05:30:57.430 --> 05:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:30:59.910 --> 05:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
court in in new hampshire they would
 
05:31:01.590 --> 05:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
give us the right to go back to the
 
05:31:03.670 --> 05:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
federal government and say okay now you
 
05:31:06.708 --> 05:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
need to report these uh funds
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
so that several other states did the
 
05:31:11.030 --> 05:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
same thing they have taken it um they
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
went into the courts they were in the
 
05:31:14.470 --> 05:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
pro at the um
 
05:31:16.070 --> 05:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
at the district court level the states
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
were successful the last um just last
 
05:31:19.200 --> 05:31:19.990 align:start position:0%
were successful the last um just last
year

05:31:19.990 --> 05:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:31:22.868 --> 05:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
earlier in the middle of last year
 
05:31:25.430 --> 05:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
at the united states appeals court level
 
05:31:27.190 --> 05:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
they found in favor of the united states
 
05:31:30.150 --> 05:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
treasury so right now the only real fix
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
is um
 
05:31:34.788 --> 05:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
hopeful fixed uh two um
 
05:31:37.670 --> 05:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
bills that should be refiled in
 
05:31:39.750 --> 05:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
the present
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
congressional session they were filed
 
05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
live in the last session one in the
 
05:31:45.510 --> 05:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
senate one in the house looking for some
 
05:31:47.590 --> 05:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
modified fix to that
 
05:31:47.600 --> 05:31:48.708 align:start position:0%
modified fix to that
um

05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:50.390 --> 05:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough they had the filed
 
05:31:52.230 --> 05:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
by a united states senator and a
 
05:31:52.240 --> 05:31:53.430 align:start position:0%
by a united states senator and a
congressman

05:31:53.430 --> 05:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
congressman
 
05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
both who formerly served as state
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
treasurers so that's where that stands
 
05:31:59.910 --> 05:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
out that doesn't seem as promising in
 
05:32:01.910 --> 05:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
the short term now as the uncashed
 
05:32:03.670 --> 05:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
retirement plan
 
05:32:04.868 --> 05:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
and then the fourth one i just touched
 
05:32:08.150 --> 05:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
upon is the pre-need funeral accounts
 
05:32:10.548 --> 05:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
we have uh many audits that we're doing
 
05:32:10.558 --> 05:32:12.470 align:start position:0%
we have uh many audits that we're doing
um

05:32:12.470 --> 05:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:14.470 --> 05:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
several audits that we're doing for com
 
05:32:14.480 --> 05:32:15.270 align:start position:0%
several audits that we're doing for com
with

05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
one of our audit firms looking at the
 
05:32:19.350 --> 05:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
national not the local female homes
 
05:32:20.948 --> 05:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
looking at the national
 
05:32:20.958 --> 05:32:22.868 align:start position:0%
looking at the national
um

05:32:22.868 --> 05:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:25.190 --> 05:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh providers of funeral services that
 
05:32:27.350 --> 05:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
have these prenatal accounts and they've
 
05:32:30.390 --> 05:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
been very reluctant to turn over funds
 
05:32:33.590 --> 05:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
and and the the
 
05:32:35.270 --> 05:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
the position is and we'd like to you
 
05:32:37.110 --> 05:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
know have the article forward so we can
 
05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
verify it is
 
05:32:39.990 --> 05:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
in many of these instances they're
 
05:32:42.548 --> 05:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
holding funds for people that actually
 
05:32:44.628 --> 05:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
have already passed away and had their
 
05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
final services
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
at another facility so that the funds
 
05:32:51.270 --> 05:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
really should be released
 
05:32:54.548 --> 05:32:54.558 align:start position:0%
to the benefit of the family
 
05:32:56.628 --> 05:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
so those are some interesting things
 
05:32:56.638 --> 05:32:57.830 align:start position:0%
so those are some interesting things
there

05:32:57.830 --> 05:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:32:59.670 --> 05:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
um some of the other trends and
 
05:33:02.390 --> 05:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
initiatives that we have
 
05:33:05.590 --> 05:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh on our audit side is on
 
05:33:07.110 --> 05:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
we're now looking some of the other
 
05:33:09.110 --> 05:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
firms looking to do transfer agent audit
 
05:33:10.708 --> 05:33:10.718 align:start position:0%
for us for securities
 
05:33:12.628 --> 05:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
now securities audits in the past for
 
05:33:14.230 --> 05:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property are always based at
 
05:33:16.230 --> 05:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
the holder level
 
05:33:18.788 --> 05:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
and then you look back to the holder
 
05:33:21.110 --> 05:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
interaction with the transfer agent so
 
05:33:22.548 --> 05:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
now we're actually going into the
 
05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
transfer agent and reviewing the
 
05:33:26.470 --> 05:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
transfer agent practices
 
05:33:27.990 --> 05:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
and what that is showing is that there's
 
05:33:30.390 --> 05:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
transfer agent practices that were
 
05:33:30.400 --> 05:33:31.590 align:start position:0%
transfer agent practices that were
um

05:33:31.590 --> 05:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:33.910 --> 05:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
coding counts as undormant when they
 
05:33:35.990 --> 05:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
were dormant and the companies never
 
05:33:38.470 --> 05:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
knew that about that so we have seen
 
05:33:38.480 --> 05:33:39.590 align:start position:0%
knew that about that so we have seen
um

05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:41.350 --> 05:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
a beginning of um
 
05:33:43.270 --> 05:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
an expansion of reporting of more
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
securities based upon those transfer
 
05:33:48.070 --> 05:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
agent-based audits
 
05:33:48.080 --> 05:33:49.750 align:start position:0%
agent-based audits
um

05:33:49.750 --> 05:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:52.470 --> 05:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
we're also looking we so we in the the
 
05:33:54.948 --> 05:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
audit sector
 
05:33:57.270 --> 05:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
the the way it works um
 
05:33:59.510 --> 05:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
for multi-state audits
 
05:34:01.350 --> 05:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
the states have contracts with uh
 
05:34:03.350 --> 05:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
several recognized firms we have them
 
05:34:05.990 --> 05:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
without seven with um seven firms
 
05:34:06.000 --> 05:34:07.270 align:start position:0%
without seven with um seven firms
ourselves

05:34:07.270 --> 05:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
05:34:09.110 --> 05:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
three of them are ones that have been in
 
05:34:10.708 --> 05:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
this um
 
05:34:12.548 --> 05:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
this particular area of unclaimed
 
05:34:15.030 --> 05:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
property order for 20 years
 
05:34:16.470 --> 05:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
or more
 
05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
and they're very good they produce great
 
05:34:18.718 --> 05:34:19.830 align:start position:0%
and they're very good they produce great
compliance

05:34:19.830 --> 05:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
05:34:19.840 --> 05:34:20.628 align:start position:0%
compliance
um

05:34:20.628 --> 05:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:22.628 --> 05:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
resulted in
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands if not uh you know
 
05:34:26.070 --> 05:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
close to a million dollars of property
 
05:34:27.430 --> 05:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
being transferred to new hampshire on an
 
05:34:28.868 --> 05:34:28.878 align:start position:0%
annual basis
 
05:34:30.628 --> 05:34:30.638 align:start position:0%
but they tend to look at
 
05:34:32.708 --> 05:34:32.718 align:start position:0%
those traditional areas something like a
 
05:34:35.110 --> 05:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
transfer agent or a large company
 
05:34:37.670 --> 05:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
so we've also uh there's some new firms
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
that are offering these services and
 
05:34:40.548 --> 05:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
they're looking
 
05:34:42.230 --> 05:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
they're they're willing to take a chance
 
05:34:43.510 --> 05:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
looking at some of these you know
 
05:34:46.868 --> 05:34:46.878 align:start position:0%
emerging businesses and and online type
 
05:34:46.878 --> 05:34:48.230 align:start position:0%
emerging businesses and and online type
businesses

05:34:48.230 --> 05:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:34:50.230 --> 05:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
and those work out great there are some
 
05:34:52.150 --> 05:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
short-term findings but often times
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're probably on finance with some of
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
those newer businesses that they're
 
05:34:57.270 --> 05:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
looking at but it serves as an education
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh educational benefit
 
05:35:02.310 --> 05:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh long term because when they go in
 
05:35:03.990 --> 05:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
there and and they do this review with
 
05:35:05.430 --> 05:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
these new companies
 
05:35:07.670 --> 05:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
they may have not had any idea of what
 
05:35:09.270 --> 05:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
they needed to do to be in compliance
 
05:35:11.350 --> 05:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
with individual states unclaimed
 
05:35:13.350 --> 05:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
property laws and now moving forward
 
05:35:15.190 --> 05:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
they will
 
05:35:16.868 --> 05:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
holder outreach is something we also
 
05:35:18.868 --> 05:35:18.878 align:start position:0%
want to do to bring about more in-state
 
05:35:21.430 --> 05:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
compliance and the way and what we do
 
05:35:23.190 --> 05:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
with the holder outreach and we have a
 
05:35:24.628 --> 05:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
team put in place
 
05:35:27.190 --> 05:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
it has been delayed by uh first some
 
05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
staffing issues um with with illnesses
 
05:35:32.230 --> 05:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
and they are on the staff and then over
 
05:35:35.030 --> 05:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
the last year just you know the room
 
05:35:37.110 --> 05:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
different type of
 
05:35:38.948 --> 05:35:38.958 align:start position:0%
work environment that we've been in but
 
05:35:40.548 --> 05:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
we have a program ready to go and that's
 
05:35:43.030 --> 05:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a
 
05:35:43.040 --> 05:35:45.830 align:start position:0%
going to be a
non-aggressive

05:35:45.830 --> 05:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
non-aggressive
 
05:35:47.910 --> 05:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
holder outreach to in-state um
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
businesses to let them know that there
 
05:35:50.390 --> 05:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
are on
 
05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property requirements to
 
05:35:52.320 --> 05:35:53.350 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property requirements to
report

05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
report
 
05:35:55.590 --> 05:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
and this is how you would come back into
 
05:35:57.430 --> 05:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
you come into compliance and you'd be
 
05:35:59.190 --> 05:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
able to do that without any penalties or
 
05:36:00.708 --> 05:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
interest so that that's something we're
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
ready to roll out as we emerge from the
 
05:36:03.840 --> 05:36:04.628 align:start position:0%
ready to roll out as we emerge from the
um

05:36:04.628 --> 05:36:04.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:07.350 --> 05:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
present situation that we're in
 
05:36:08.788 --> 05:36:08.798 align:start position:0%
the next two areas just want to touch
 
05:36:10.868 --> 05:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
upon quite quickly are the um what we've
 
05:36:13.110 --> 05:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
done is um
 
05:36:14.788 --> 05:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
within the last year we've moved to
 
05:36:17.110 --> 05:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
automation of claims um treasurer
 
05:36:19.270 --> 05:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
mesopotamia touched upon us it works
 
05:36:19.280 --> 05:36:20.150 align:start position:0%
mesopotamia touched upon us it works
great

05:36:20.150 --> 05:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
great
 
05:36:22.150 --> 05:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
i say it's user friendly but the example
 
05:36:24.470 --> 05:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
i like to give is when we do outreach or
 
05:36:27.190 --> 05:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
when we were doing that which before um
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic would you know
 
05:36:30.548 --> 05:36:30.558 align:start position:0%
actually go out to a show and we'd deal
 
05:36:31.750 --> 05:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
with people and
 
05:36:33.030 --> 05:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know see if they had unclean
 
05:36:34.548 --> 05:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
property whether it be
 
05:36:34.558 --> 05:36:35.430 align:start position:0%
property whether it be
um

05:36:35.430 --> 05:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:37.270 --> 05:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
made new hampshire expo or something
 
05:36:38.390 --> 05:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:36:39.910 --> 05:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
and you typically see
 
05:36:42.628 --> 05:36:42.638 align:start position:0%
individuals in their
 
05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
20s to 30s stop by the booth find out
 
05:36:47.110 --> 05:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
that they have property and just want to
 
05:36:48.390 --> 05:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
take down their information and tell
 
05:36:49.830 --> 05:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
them they would be issuing them a claim
 
05:36:51.670 --> 05:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
for them in the mail next week and they
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
just say oh no i'll do it online and
 
05:36:55.990 --> 05:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
like well we didn't have that capability
 
05:36:58.230 --> 05:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
and they'd walk away so i think this is
 
05:37:00.390 --> 05:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
a great way to reach out to them and
 
05:37:00.400 --> 05:37:01.110 align:start position:0%
a great way to reach out to them and
and

05:37:01.110 --> 05:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:02.788 --> 05:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
more people are comfortable doing that
 
05:37:04.470 --> 05:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
initiating the process online and
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
actually finishing it online
 
05:37:09.030 --> 05:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
um and and it does expedite expedites
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
more timely payments
 
05:37:12.230 --> 05:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
then we're moving into a further
 
05:37:13.750 --> 05:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
initiative which is going to allow the
 
05:37:15.750 --> 05:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
automation of some small claims
 
05:37:15.760 --> 05:37:17.190 align:start position:0%
automation of some small claims
automatically

05:37:17.190 --> 05:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
05:37:18.788 --> 05:37:18.798 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be based upon
 
05:37:18.798 --> 05:37:20.310 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be based upon
utilizing

05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
utilizing
 
05:37:22.548 --> 05:37:22.558 align:start position:0%
a lexus nexus owner verification
 
05:37:24.948 --> 05:37:24.958 align:start position:0%
software that has scoring that from the
 
05:37:27.430 --> 05:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
information provided from the holder and
 
05:37:29.670 --> 05:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
the information provided by the claimant
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
can come to a certain percentage match
 
05:37:34.948 --> 05:37:34.958 align:start position:0%
that the state will set then those
 
05:37:37.030 --> 05:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
payments will initiate automatically the
 
05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
person would get an email once they put
 
05:37:39.830 --> 05:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
that claim and they wouldn't even get
 
05:37:41.990 --> 05:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
the claim form i have to provide any
 
05:37:43.990 --> 05:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
documentation would say you're providing
 
05:37:45.990 --> 05:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
us enough documentation you should be
 
05:37:47.830 --> 05:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
receiving a check from the state in one
 
05:37:49.270 --> 05:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
to two weeks
 
05:37:50.628 --> 05:37:50.638 align:start position:0%
some of the states that have gone to
 
05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
this um
 
05:37:54.548 --> 05:37:54.558 align:start position:0%
have gone up to thresholds that are much
 
05:37:57.030 --> 05:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
higher than we are comfortable with
 
05:37:58.708 --> 05:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
we're looking to when we roll it out in
 
05:38:01.030 --> 05:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
july of this year we're looking to start
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
off with claims 100 unless
 
05:38:07.110 --> 05:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
um but there's so many small claims that
 
05:38:08.948 --> 05:38:08.958 align:start position:0%
now when we issue them and it's
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
typically those 100 100
 
05:38:13.670 --> 05:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
the people get the paper claim form they
 
05:38:14.948 --> 05:38:14.958 align:start position:0%
see that they have to provide some
 
05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
documentation and they say is it really
 
05:38:20.470 --> 05:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
worth my time so i think we'll see a
 
05:38:23.430 --> 05:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
much more a great deal more payments
 
05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
being made off of those small claims
 
05:38:27.030 --> 05:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
which would be great for us because we
 
05:38:28.948 --> 05:38:28.958 align:start position:0%
end up
 
05:38:30.948 --> 05:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
reissuing those same claims over and
 
05:38:32.230 --> 05:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
over to the people and they don't send
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
them back
 
05:38:35.350 --> 05:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you for listening to that and
 
05:38:36.708 --> 05:38:36.718 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions i'd be happy
 
05:38:39.830 --> 05:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:42.310 --> 05:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you tom and
 
05:38:44.150 --> 05:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to uh you know just
 
05:38:47.110 --> 05:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
to to wrap up the presentation um you
 
05:38:48.788 --> 05:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
know the one thing i wanted to just
 
05:38:50.868 --> 05:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
mention is
 
05:38:53.110 --> 05:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
as you heard today uh you know this this
 
05:38:54.548 --> 05:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
program is really not designed to
 
05:38:56.788 --> 05:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
generate revenue uh it really is
 
05:38:59.190 --> 05:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
designed to recover property and and to
 
05:39:01.750 --> 05:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
return those funds to the proper owners
 
05:39:04.230 --> 05:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
but um because of the way this this
 
05:39:06.470 --> 05:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
program is um you know at the end of
 
05:39:08.628 --> 05:39:08.638 align:start position:0%
this process uh the you know
 
05:39:10.708 --> 05:39:10.718 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue has generated and
 
05:39:13.910 --> 05:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's how the general fund is is benef
 
05:39:17.670 --> 05:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
benefits from from from this but um
 
05:39:19.750 --> 05:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
but again uh you know it's it's a very
 
05:39:22.230 --> 05:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
unique program so we thought um that's
 
05:39:24.390 --> 05:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to give you this overview
 
05:39:25.910 --> 05:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
and spend a little more time so
 
05:39:28.548 --> 05:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
hopefully this was helpful to you today
 
05:39:30.070 --> 05:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
and with that uh we conclude our
 
05:39:32.230 --> 05:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
presentation we'll be happy to answer
 
05:39:33.750 --> 05:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
any any other questions that come the
 
05:39:35.910 --> 05:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee may have okay we have a couple
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
of questions represented
 
05:39:38.638 --> 05:39:39.750 align:start position:0%
of questions represented

gian
 
05:39:44.230 --> 05:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
05:39:46.708 --> 05:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
my i have two two quick questions one is
 
05:39:46.718 --> 05:39:47.510 align:start position:0%
my i have two two quick questions one is
um

05:39:47.510 --> 05:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:49.830 --> 05:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh regarding the vendor checks i i
 
05:39:52.150 --> 05:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
didn't quite understand that i mean the
 
05:39:53.910 --> 05:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
check is good for six months so does
 
05:39:54.868 --> 05:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
that mean
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
if a vendor writes a check
 
05:39:58.390 --> 05:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
and then you pass the six months the
 
05:39:59.830 --> 05:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
check is no longer good but is it
 
05:39:59.840 --> 05:40:00.788 align:start position:0%
check is no longer good but is it
because

05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:40:03.110 --> 05:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's still a liability owed
 
05:40:05.670 --> 05:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
that if that person comes back and says
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know i never got my check
 
05:40:08.230 --> 05:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and it's the liability it's not the
 
05:40:12.548 --> 05:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
still date on the check i it'd be that
 
05:40:14.628 --> 05:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
that has that same dormancy period as
 
05:40:15.830 --> 05:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
the other accounts we were talking about
 
05:40:18.548 --> 05:40:18.558 align:start position:0%
would be a five-year dormancy period so
 
05:40:18.558 --> 05:40:19.750 align:start position:0%
would be a five-year dormancy period so
if

05:40:19.750 --> 05:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:40:21.270 --> 05:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
this the check was still it was still
 
05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
dated it's not a valid check anymore but
 
05:40:25.670 --> 05:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's still showing on the records of the
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
company as an outstanding liability and
 
05:40:31.430 --> 05:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
that five-year period ends then if it
 
05:40:32.470 --> 05:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
hasn't been
 
05:40:35.190 --> 05:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
mitigated by a mediated through you know
 
05:40:37.110 --> 05:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
another payment or another purchase if
 
05:40:39.350 --> 05:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's still showing as that same
 
05:40:41.110 --> 05:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
liability on the records then that
 
05:40:42.628 --> 05:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
should be reported at the end of that
 
05:40:44.628 --> 05:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
five-year period
 
05:40:46.948 --> 05:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
okay that makes sense and then my second
 
05:40:48.230 --> 05:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
question is
 
05:40:51.030 --> 05:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
um what keeps an account active so in
 
05:40:53.670 --> 05:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
other words if i mean the obvious thing
 
05:40:55.750 --> 05:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
would be somebody makes a deposit or a
 
05:40:59.270 --> 05:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
withdrawal or something but is it is it
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
enough for someone just to log in look
 
05:41:03.110 --> 05:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
at their account and log out does that
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
keep it active
 
05:41:06.150 --> 05:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
i my
 
05:41:08.070 --> 05:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
the statute is not specific enough of
 
05:41:10.548 --> 05:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
that but but the way that we have
 
05:41:12.788 --> 05:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
treated that with wave and phone banks
 
05:41:15.350 --> 05:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
for us we would say yes
 
05:41:19.270 --> 05:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
if that is if that login and log out is
 
05:41:22.150 --> 05:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
password protected and there is a
 
05:41:24.470 --> 05:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
comfort level by that institution that
 
05:41:25.990 --> 05:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
they know that that was the account
 
05:41:28.230 --> 05:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
holder that actually logged in if it was
 
05:41:30.788 --> 05:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
just someone saying that you know and
 
05:41:32.390 --> 05:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert on it but if they
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
could show that someone with that email
 
05:41:36.788 --> 05:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
address logged on to the bank's website
 
05:41:38.548 --> 05:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
that certainly wouldn't constitute that
 
05:41:40.868 --> 05:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
activity but we have extended activity
 
05:41:42.230 --> 05:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
that if
 
05:41:44.070 --> 05:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
logging into your account even if you
 
05:41:46.708 --> 05:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
didn't make a transaction um on a
 
05:41:51.110 --> 05:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:52.390 --> 05:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
um account
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
um viewings uh viewing format then we
 
05:41:58.548 --> 05:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
would say that that would be contact
 
05:42:02.070 --> 05:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay good and another another good thing
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
important thing to remember is that if
 
05:42:06.548 --> 05:42:06.558 align:start position:0%
people have multiple accounts at banks
 
05:42:08.390 --> 05:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
we also recognize what's called cross
 
05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
referencing so if you had that rainy day
 
05:42:11.040 --> 05:42:11.910 align:start position:0%
referencing so if you had that rainy day
account

05:42:11.910 --> 05:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
account
 
05:42:13.670 --> 05:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
but you also had a checking account and
 
05:42:15.830 --> 05:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
that checking account was active as long
 
05:42:17.510 --> 05:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
as they send the notice out to you at
 
05:42:20.708 --> 05:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
that that that address and let you know
 
05:42:22.788 --> 05:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
at that time that
 
05:42:25.030 --> 05:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
the con it says it's dormant but because
 
05:42:26.230 --> 05:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
of your other account we would have
 
05:42:27.910 --> 05:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
considered doing it then they wouldn't
 
05:42:29.670 --> 05:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
have to do that because they they know
 
05:42:31.590 --> 05:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
that the person still has
 
05:42:33.830 --> 05:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
as cognizant of having a relationship
 
05:42:36.150 --> 05:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
with that bank
 
05:42:38.628 --> 05:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
05:42:38.638 --> 05:42:41.910 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
representative

05:42:41.910 --> 05:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:46.150 --> 05:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a question also for the
 
05:42:49.030 --> 05:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
treasurer afterwards but i've been
 
05:42:50.788 --> 05:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
checking your
 
05:42:52.948 --> 05:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
your find your property
 
05:42:56.310 --> 05:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
site and to my horror i discovered that
 
05:42:59.110 --> 05:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
my father who has been dead for
 
05:43:00.868 --> 05:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
for 18 years
 
05:43:03.190 --> 05:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
on was apparently still considered an
 
05:43:06.628 --> 05:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
active a member of the jua
 
05:43:06.638 --> 05:43:07.750 align:start position:0%
active a member of the jua
payout

05:43:07.750 --> 05:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
payout
 
05:43:10.390 --> 05:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
and is still listed there but
 
05:43:13.910 --> 05:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is my problem he is listed as a
 
05:43:16.390 --> 05:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
combination of himself and somebody
 
05:43:19.590 --> 05:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
named la plant in uh
 
05:43:21.350 --> 05:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
on milford
 
05:43:23.830 --> 05:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
and milford has a zip code which is one
 
05:43:25.910 --> 05:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
digit off of ours
 
05:43:28.390 --> 05:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
on off of his
 
05:43:31.110 --> 05:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
where he died on
 
05:43:32.708 --> 05:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
what do you do
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
to report
 
05:43:36.948 --> 05:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
what you think are mistakes because his
 
05:43:39.030 --> 05:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
was a very unusual name
 
05:43:39.040 --> 05:43:40.070 align:start position:0%
was a very unusual name
on

05:43:40.070 --> 05:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:43:42.708 --> 05:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
and there i was i give gold and i can't
 
05:43:45.670 --> 05:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
find the other guy
 
05:43:49.110 --> 05:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
and well typically i would i'd
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
if it was a portal like that it would be
 
05:43:52.310 --> 05:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
someone that they may have been in
 
05:43:54.150 --> 05:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
practice with but if you don't recognize
 
05:43:55.510 --> 05:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
the name at all
 
05:43:56.948 --> 05:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
then uh then
 
05:43:59.510 --> 05:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
there could be and again that report was
 
05:44:01.350 --> 05:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
not great in the format that we received
 
05:44:03.510 --> 05:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
it was actually provided to us
 
05:44:03.520 --> 05:44:04.470 align:start position:0%
it was actually provided to us
by

05:44:04.470 --> 05:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:44:04.480 --> 05:44:05.990 align:start position:0%
by
the

05:44:05.990 --> 05:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:44:07.830 --> 05:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
a company that was working for the law
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
firm that did the final settlement the
 
05:44:13.270 --> 05:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
good thing is we've had you know we're
 
05:44:15.110 --> 05:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
paid a great number of claims out on
 
05:44:16.548 --> 05:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
that report so that there is some good
 
05:44:18.548 --> 05:44:18.558 align:start position:0%
information but if you
 
05:44:20.548 --> 05:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
it's something like that and it and i'd
 
05:44:21.910 --> 05:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
be the same answer that i'd give to any
 
05:44:24.390 --> 05:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
more call if you contacted our office
 
05:44:25.910 --> 05:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
spoke to um one of the claims
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
representatives or spoke directly to me
 
05:44:30.150 --> 05:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
we'd do whatever we could to try to
 
05:44:32.628 --> 05:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
differentiate you know to try to to see
 
05:44:34.868 --> 05:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
if we could get that definitive event or
 
05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
who that is
 
05:44:38.708 --> 05:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
it's not as easy with an existing holder
 
05:44:40.150 --> 05:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
but we would all i could certainly we
 
05:44:42.470 --> 05:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
could reach back out to the yet the
 
05:44:44.708 --> 05:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
company that did produce that actual
 
05:44:47.030 --> 05:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
report to see if they could uh do some
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
more research on that but that is
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
something that we would we certainly do
 
05:44:51.910 --> 05:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
for anyone that comes forward with that
 
05:44:53.590 --> 05:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
question but would be more than happy to
 
05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
do that for you as well
 
05:44:58.310 --> 05:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i was wondering more whether
 
05:44:59.350 --> 05:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
you could
 
05:45:01.910 --> 05:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
put some kind of indicator on the web
 
05:45:04.868 --> 05:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
page as to what you do if you think that
 
05:45:07.270 --> 05:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
that you've got some of the information
 
05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
but you don't have all of it
 
05:45:09.840 --> 05:45:10.948 align:start position:0%
but you don't have all of it
yeah

05:45:10.948 --> 05:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:45:12.470 --> 05:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
i i mean we could
 
05:45:14.708 --> 05:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
typically if if it's people are having
 
05:45:17.670 --> 05:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
difficulty with the you know it's always
 
05:45:20.150 --> 05:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know reach out and we're for a small
 
05:45:21.750 --> 05:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
office where
 
05:45:24.470 --> 05:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
usually very easy to contact we and we
 
05:45:25.830 --> 05:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
do try to call back it's a little bit
 
05:45:27.670 --> 05:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
different now because we're not we do
 
05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
have some we have some staff remote on
 
05:45:31.830 --> 05:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
particular days so we don't have the
 
05:45:33.350 --> 05:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
same number of people in answering the
 
05:45:35.350 --> 05:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
phones on any given day but um we
 
05:45:37.270 --> 05:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
certainly could do that and um i'll
 
05:45:39.430 --> 05:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
certainly take that under advisement we
 
05:45:41.750 --> 05:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
work with the the entity that provides
 
05:45:44.070 --> 05:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
us with that internet service actually
 
05:45:46.628 --> 05:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
provides that this nearly 30 states as
 
05:45:48.788 --> 05:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
well now so it's probably something that
 
05:45:50.070 --> 05:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
one of the other states has gone through
 
05:45:52.788 --> 05:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
and i could i will look into that
 
05:45:54.390 --> 05:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
you had also a question for the
 
05:45:54.400 --> 05:45:55.750 align:start position:0%
you had also a question for the
treasurer

05:45:55.750 --> 05:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
05:45:57.510 --> 05:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
well i did if you want me to ask it at
 
05:45:59.910 --> 05:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
the same time it's totally unrelated to
 
05:46:02.868 --> 05:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
this unabanded property however
 
05:46:04.548 --> 05:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
on we
 
05:46:07.750 --> 05:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
on you issue a
 
05:46:10.788 --> 05:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
bond issuance document
 
05:46:14.070 --> 05:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
on each time you do a major bond
 
05:46:14.080 --> 05:46:14.948 align:start position:0%
on each time you do a major bond
sale

05:46:14.948 --> 05:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
sale
 
05:46:17.750 --> 05:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that is incredibly valuable for
 
05:46:19.190 --> 05:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
someone who's trying to understand the
 
05:46:21.030 --> 05:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire economy
 
05:46:22.150 --> 05:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:46:23.910 --> 05:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
can't figure out where to find it on
 
05:46:25.590 --> 05:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
your website and i think the committee
 
05:46:28.150 --> 05:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
would like to know
 
05:46:28.160 --> 05:46:29.350 align:start position:0%
would like to know
absolutely

05:46:29.350 --> 05:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
i can certainly send a link
 
05:46:33.270 --> 05:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
where we have it posted on the website
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
and we also have physical
 
05:46:37.430 --> 05:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
we we have physical books in our office
 
05:46:39.670 --> 05:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
we have plenty to distribute if there is
 
05:46:42.470 --> 05:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
a way that we could um you know we could
 
05:46:45.510 --> 05:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
um also facilitate that i mean we'll be
 
05:46:47.030 --> 05:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
happy to give you some of the uh you
 
05:46:49.270 --> 05:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
know the the physical books that we have
 
05:46:51.030 --> 05:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
but certainly i will i will share the
 
05:46:53.670 --> 05:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
link you know what i think um you know
 
05:46:55.910 --> 05:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh chris shea and i
 
05:46:58.070 --> 05:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
spoke about this before i think if if
 
05:46:59.750 --> 05:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
the lba can figure out a way how to
 
05:47:01.670 --> 05:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
distribute those books we'll be happy to
 
05:47:04.470 --> 05:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
keep them out um but i will share that
 
05:47:06.948 --> 05:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
link um so everyone has access to at
 
05:47:09.540 --> 05:47:09.550 align:start position:0%
least the electronic copy right now
 
05:47:09.550 --> 05:47:11.270 align:start position:0%
least the electronic copy right now

representative
 
05:47:15.510 --> 05:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
phillips or did you
 
05:47:18.390 --> 05:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
pull your hand down i did remove my hand
 
05:47:21.910 --> 05:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
sir i um thank you mr chair i had a
 
05:47:23.430 --> 05:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
question on a follow-up about the
 
05:47:27.590 --> 05:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
initiatives for the cryptocurrencies um
 
05:47:30.390 --> 05:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
but i realize this is probably a really
 
05:47:32.230 --> 05:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
tangential question i'm happy to just
 
05:47:34.230 --> 05:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
email my question to the treasurer's
 
05:47:36.788 --> 05:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
team and um try it
 
05:47:38.150 --> 05:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
well my understanding is that
 
05:47:40.628 --> 05:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency accounts are password
 
05:47:42.628 --> 05:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
protected and that the holder and the
 
05:47:46.470 --> 05:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
rightful owner of the money the money is
 
05:47:48.390 --> 05:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
solely indicated by whoever has the
 
05:47:49.670 --> 05:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
right password
 
05:47:51.670 --> 05:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
so i have a little con
 
05:47:52.788 --> 05:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:47:55.030 --> 05:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
i guess spatial understanding of how
 
05:47:58.070 --> 05:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
the account is deemed dormant and would
 
05:47:59.670 --> 05:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
be in a
 
05:48:02.310 --> 05:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know assigned to new hampshire
 
05:48:03.350 --> 05:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:48:05.830 --> 05:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know if for some reason it sheets to
 
05:48:07.030 --> 05:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:48:09.350 --> 05:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
and goes past the statutory period and
 
05:48:11.830 --> 05:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
become state owned but we don't have the
 
05:48:14.868 --> 05:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
password what is to protect that value
 
05:48:17.190 --> 05:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
if someone who had the password
 
05:48:18.788 --> 05:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
entered the password and took the money
 
05:48:20.708 --> 05:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
and took the cryptocurrency away from us
 
05:48:22.830 --> 05:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
i mean how to protect that
 
05:48:25.990 --> 05:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
um furthermore um
 
05:48:27.830 --> 05:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
what are other states doing is has
 
05:48:30.150 --> 05:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
anyone been successful in trying to
 
05:48:31.990 --> 05:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
redeem a cryptocurrency because my
 
05:48:33.030 --> 05:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that's not
 
05:48:33.040 --> 05:48:34.948 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that's not
happening

05:48:34.948 --> 05:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
happening
 
05:48:38.708 --> 05:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
it's again and that's why we it is truly
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
at its infancy stages for the states and
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
those holders and like i said there are
 
05:48:46.948 --> 05:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
i guess with the password protection and
 
05:48:49.350 --> 05:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
all of that of the various accounts they
 
05:48:51.510 --> 05:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
would at least know if there hasn't been
 
05:48:51.520 --> 05:48:52.628 align:start position:0%
would at least know if there hasn't been
any

05:48:52.628 --> 05:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:48:54.470 --> 05:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
activity in that account
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
so they could make that initial
 
05:48:59.030 --> 05:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh determination as of being dormant
 
05:49:02.150 --> 05:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
if it was transferred to our custodian
 
05:49:03.910 --> 05:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
and the process they put in place it
 
05:49:05.510 --> 05:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be held in that account any
 
05:49:07.910 --> 05:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
longer it'd be i mean in a way it'll be
 
05:49:09.430 --> 05:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
like the securities
 
05:49:12.150 --> 05:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
when a security is transferred to us it
 
05:49:15.430 --> 05:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
comes out of the name of john smith
 
05:49:16.948 --> 05:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
and it is transferred during the time
 
05:49:19.190 --> 05:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we hold it it's held in on nominee
 
05:49:21.270 --> 05:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
name which is old man and co when a
 
05:49:23.590 --> 05:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
person comes forward to claim it we then
 
05:49:25.350 --> 05:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
go back and if they want to re-register
 
05:49:28.310 --> 05:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
it we tell our custodian take those five
 
05:49:30.310 --> 05:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
shares of company xyz
 
05:49:33.910 --> 05:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
re-register it in the name of john smith
 
05:49:33.920 --> 05:49:35.430 align:start position:0%
re-register it in the name of john smith
um

05:49:35.430 --> 05:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:38.070 --> 05:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
so so that so that process but again
 
05:49:40.708 --> 05:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
like i this this is all new
 
05:49:42.150 --> 05:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:49:43.910 --> 05:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
none of the states have taken in there's
 
05:49:45.590 --> 05:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
no state that has taken in any
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency as as of yet we have all
 
05:49:49.830 --> 05:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
been approached by holders that would
 
05:49:51.270 --> 05:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
like us to
 
05:49:53.910 --> 05:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
our custodians have given us a method to
 
05:49:55.990 --> 05:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
do that and now one of our audit
 
05:49:58.230 --> 05:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
partners is going to
 
05:50:00.070 --> 05:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
present us with um
 
05:50:01.590 --> 05:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
with um some
 
05:50:01.600 --> 05:50:02.390 align:start position:0%
with um some
some

05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:50:04.548 --> 05:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
firms that they think uh
 
05:50:06.868 --> 05:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
ones that should be reviewed first and i
 
05:50:08.628 --> 05:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
think at that point
 
05:50:10.868 --> 05:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
and um so i'd like you know keep a
 
05:50:13.270 --> 05:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
quarter i think i would be much
 
05:50:15.190 --> 05:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
once that process starts with the audit
 
05:50:17.110 --> 05:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
firm i'd be in a much better position to
 
05:50:19.110 --> 05:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
give you an answer of how that process
 
05:50:21.430 --> 05:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
may work when it is transferred to us
 
05:50:24.230 --> 05:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
but i i don't have that information as
 
05:50:26.788 --> 05:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
at this point yeah i mean i think that's
 
05:50:28.868 --> 05:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
just the point is that i think this is
 
05:50:31.510 --> 05:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
such a new and burgeoning area
 
05:50:33.910 --> 05:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
um that no one really has the answers or
 
05:50:36.150 --> 05:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
logistics because it hasn't been done
 
05:50:37.510 --> 05:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
furthermore i mean
 
05:50:39.990 --> 05:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
it is no insignificant amount of value
 
05:50:42.310 --> 05:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's related to these currencies so i
 
05:50:44.070 --> 05:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
can see why it's important for people to
 
05:50:46.470 --> 05:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
try to investigate and to figure out
 
05:50:48.310 --> 05:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
what would a potential
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
achievement look like but um
 
05:50:52.948 --> 05:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
i just practically i
 
05:50:54.390 --> 05:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
am very concerned i don't think it's
 
05:50:56.470 --> 05:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
probably realistic right away
 
05:50:58.230 --> 05:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
right but one of the things that when
 
05:51:00.310 --> 05:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
you look at unclaimed property and it's
 
05:51:02.230 --> 05:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's cut probably a
 
05:51:04.390 --> 05:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's a dark way to look at it because
 
05:51:06.070 --> 05:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's so much property that we receive
 
05:51:08.070 --> 05:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
that is up that is for people that are
 
05:51:08.080 --> 05:51:09.110 align:start position:0%
that is up that is for people that are
living

05:51:09.110 --> 05:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
living
 
05:51:11.830 --> 05:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
but we are we also receiving you know a
 
05:51:14.070 --> 05:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
great deal of property in any given year
 
05:51:15.990 --> 05:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
for people that have passed away
 
05:51:19.190 --> 05:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
and so as these emerging i mean
 
05:51:21.830 --> 05:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency was you know
 
05:51:24.070 --> 05:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's going on it's like a 10-year period
 
05:51:25.990 --> 05:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
now so you probably do have some of
 
05:51:27.670 --> 05:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
those they are probably holding funds
 
05:51:29.910 --> 05:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
for some people that have actually
 
05:51:32.708 --> 05:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
passed away and and if there is no way
 
05:51:34.788 --> 05:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
to deal with that if there's we don't
 
05:51:36.310 --> 05:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
put in a process some way to deal with
 
05:51:38.708 --> 05:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
that then you go back to
 
05:51:40.390 --> 05:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
the same thing that there was before the
 
05:51:42.150 --> 05:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
way anyone came properly laws at all and
 
05:51:43.190 --> 05:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
05:51:44.948 --> 05:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
an undue enrichment to the holder that
 
05:51:46.788 --> 05:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
is holding these funds so
 
05:51:48.708 --> 05:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
again it's not going to be easy i don't
 
05:51:50.150 --> 05:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
know where it's going to end up but it
 
05:51:51.430 --> 05:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
is something that i think we really
 
05:51:54.390 --> 05:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
should at least on the ground level see
 
05:51:56.788 --> 05:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
where it goes
 
05:51:58.150 --> 05:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
and at some point we'd probably have to
 
05:51:59.830 --> 05:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
go back to the legislature before we did
 
05:52:01.990 --> 05:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
anything to actually to move forward on
 
05:52:02.000 --> 05:52:03.910 align:start position:0%
anything to actually to move forward on
that

05:52:03.910 --> 05:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:52:03.920 --> 05:52:05.350 align:start position:0%
that
okay

05:52:05.350 --> 05:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:52:07.670 --> 05:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see any more questions
 
05:52:08.868 --> 05:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
05:52:10.868 --> 05:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
one minute after three
 
05:52:13.030 --> 05:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i want to thank uh
 
05:52:16.230 --> 05:52:16.240 align:start position:0%

05:52:18.070 --> 05:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with this un
 
05:52:20.310 --> 05:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
plain property issue
 
05:52:23.430 --> 05:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and absolutely thank
