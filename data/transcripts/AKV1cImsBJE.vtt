previously but it's not right in front
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%

00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:01.819 align:start position:0%
while I have the committee members here
 
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
I just want to let you know that we
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative Almy brought to my
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
attention that last week on the consent
 
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
calendar a bill was passed that will
 
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
come to us as a second committee Senate
 
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:17.160 align:start position:0%

Tuesday I hope everyone can be here for
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
that so we can hear that bill it has to
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
do with the oplc dedicated fund we had a
 
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
similar Bill already in the house so
 
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
we're gonna need to take a look at that
 
00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
and see what we think so plan on next
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
week we don't know what else might be
 
00:08:46.329 --> 00:08:46.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's coming to us as a second committee
 
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940 align:start position:0%

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:58.670 align:start position:0%

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
2023-1606h to Senate bill 19.
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%

you thank you madam chair
 
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.290 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair
on

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty simple amendment to a
 
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
bill which is meant to make it on easier
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
for existing bingo games to continue to
 
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.090 align:start position:0%
for existing bingo games to continue to
exist

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
and this one on
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
has the same goal all it does is to say
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
change the 25 dollars per game date that
 
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
Charities May
 
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.030 align:start position:0%
Charities May
um

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:53.060 align:start position:0%
provide for expenses to their
 
00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
volunteers since Bingo is total has to
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
be totally run by volunteers
 
00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
and it changes it from twenty five
 
00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
dollars to fifty dollars because this
 
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
hasn't been changed in a long time and
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of inflation and if
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
somebody has to is
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:21.140 align:start position:0%
um doesn't have time to feed themselves
 
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
unless they buy food once they get there
 
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.009 align:start position:0%
unless they buy food once they get there
on

00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
apparently sometimes buying pins and
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
things on the
 
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:34.100 align:start position:0%
they they only get reimbursed up to 25
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%

is
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie but the we've checked with
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
the Senate and senator avard who is the
 
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
I hope that we can pass well I think
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
we've already got two amendments
 
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
planned for this bill and we can pass I
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
hope we can pass this one too when we
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
get to the next step after after the
 
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
caucuses thank you would you be open to
 
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.200 align:start position:0%

00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
from the members you guys have seen this
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this a little bit but
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
we we felt like we needed to schedule
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
this hearing yes representative Doucet
 
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm just curious
 
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
with uh representative Spielberg and I
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
are trying to find out I thought I had
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
seen this in a in a house bill
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
addressing the increase from 25 to 50.
 
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
am I incorrect in that or are we
 
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
collectively I don't I don't think that
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
was about bingo I think that was charity
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
games okay okay thank you
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
I I would just like to say something it
 
00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
seems to me that we are regulating Bingo
 
00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:02.339 align:start position:0%
and putting constraints on them a lot
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
more than we're doing it on on hugely
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:13.139 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to clarify you
 
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
said uh it had been 25 for a long time I
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
assume that really it's been a very long
 
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
time and this is almost housekeeping as
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
far as updating the regulation
 
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
possibly I mean it's like 20 years I
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
don't remember doing it but that doesn't
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
mean anything
 
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
um do you recall that um one of the
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
comments made by Senator
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald was one example that she gave
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
had to do with like somebody needing a
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
babysitter before they could volunteer
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
and so when you think about what a
 
00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
babysitter might cost I know you're not
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
going to get very far with 25 I don't
 
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.670 align:start position:0%
going to get very far with 25 I don't
think

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
yes uh other questions from the
 
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.690 align:start position:0%
yes uh other questions from the
committee

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
you and we have a pink card from Rhonda
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
sorry about that my name is Rhonda Lane
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
I'm consultant for the Wolverine Youth
 
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
Football Association in Derry I've been
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
involved with Bingo for 21 years
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
my concern about raising the 25 to the
 
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.189 align:start position:0%
my concern about raising the 25 to the
50

00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
I believe they should get paid and there
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
are current rules on the books for to
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
allow them to get paid they just have to
 
00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:51.620 align:start position:0%
apply for their consultant license
 
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
I have mine I have others that work
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
under me that have theirs and that's how
 
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
I'm able to pay them
 
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
the environment around Bingo
 
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:02.329 align:start position:0%
the environment around Bingo
um

00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
is suspect and unfortunately it gives
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
Bingo a bad reputation
 
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
there are a number of bingos currently
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
that pay their volunteers cash
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
and it could be fifty dollars seventy
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
dollars upwards to two hundred dollars
 
00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:23.339 align:start position:0%
from my own personal knowledge
 
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
and I just believe address bringing this
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
up to fifty dollars now you're talking
 
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.910 align:start position:0%
up to fifty dollars now you're talking
about

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
a workable wage where there's no taxes
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
on this money
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
and on top of that I don't believe the
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
current behavior and environment is
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
I just think it's just going to make
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
less profits for the Charities
 
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
as I I believe all of you received an
 
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
email from me last week
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
addressing the 16 days I just think it
 
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
allows the Bad actors to conduct this
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
type of behavior
 
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
in this type of environment we want run
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
a very successful Bingo the Wolverines I
 
00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
believe we are always in the top three
 
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire we do it
 
00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:07.139 align:start position:0%
with complete transparency we have a
 
00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
staff we have people wanting to come
 
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
volunteer for us so with the 25 isn't a
 
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.610 align:start position:0%
volunteer for us so with the 25 isn't a
problem

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:16:16.009 --> 00:16:16.019 align:start position:0%
um I think adding to that on top of what
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
is being made out with these cash
 
00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:18.949 align:start position:0%
is being made out with these cash
payments

00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
there needs to be more accuracy and
 
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
accountability through the lottery as
 
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
well and I believe they're working on
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
that to get the forms
 
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
so that there's more exposure to what's
 
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.220 align:start position:0%
actually being done Bingo is an all-cash
 
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.490 align:start position:0%
actually being done Bingo is an all-cash
business

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:33.500 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
so it does lend itself to Bad actors
 
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and in the end result the
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
players aren't getting their money and
 
00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
would you be open to questions from the
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
committee absolutely okay I'm going to
 
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
start here and go around the room
 
00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:51.779 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for sharing some of that
 
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
information because
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe there are any bingo
 
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
games around where I live in I have no
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
exposure to them at all
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
but part of my question is
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
do you understand that the bill just
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
allows people allows organizations to go
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
up to 50 and they don't have to go up to
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
50 if they don't want to
 
00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:24.419 align:start position:0%
but I believe and I feel
 
00:17:24.419 --> 00:17:25.909 align:start position:0%
but I believe and I feel
that

00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
if you're a bad actor you're going to
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
grab more nights
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
and It ultimately is going to limit the
 
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
pool of Charities that can conduct Bingo
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
and want to conducted
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:42.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to keep going around the room
 
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
and we can Circle back if we need to
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
other questions on this side seeing none
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Elber
 
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
um one of the things to be aware of in
 
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
this uh proposed amendment is that these
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
are to reimburse for expenses and there
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
has to be a
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
the expenses must be submitted this is
 
00:18:08.409 --> 00:18:08.419 align:start position:0%
not pay
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
it's specifically to reimburse expenses
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
well a charity would have a record of
 
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.230 align:start position:0%
well a charity would have a record of
those

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
right I will tell you it is my
 
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
experience that
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know where you get fifty dollars
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
in expenses between gas and meals
 
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.070 align:start position:0%
in expenses between gas and meals
um

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
I don't believe throughout the hall that
 
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
I'm currently in
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
there is one volunteer that has child
 
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.590 align:start position:0%
there is one volunteer that has child
care

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it's not possible but I
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
I wonder though if maybe some of the
 
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
folks who do have children don't
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer because they don't have child
 
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:51.539 align:start position:0%
care and this might allow them to do
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
that I can only tell you that has not
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
been my experience thank you thank you
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
madam yes you're welcome um ores did you
 
00:18:59.570 --> 00:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
also have a question yeah thank you
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
question so your concern is
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
a more legitimate charity that's run
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
properly like yours is going to suffer
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
as a result of this I
 
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
well I certainly with the 16 days I
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
think it's easy for any bad actor or any
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
hall manager to that also holds a
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
consultant license which that can be
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
addressed down the road
 
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.510 align:start position:0%
addressed down the road
um

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
they take control of the hall
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
and they'll kick Charities out to
 
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:36.860 align:start position:0%
we've just had such an experience
 
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
to get control of those nights
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
in the 16 days just opens that up to the
 
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
Bad actors hands down
 
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
100 confident that that's what's going
 
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up so is this very pervasive
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
throughout the the whole Bingo industry
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
you think or I can tell you I came in 21
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
years ago as a treasurer of the
 
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.669 align:start position:0%
years ago as a treasurer of the
organization

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:05.450 align:start position:0%
organization
and

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
just stepping in the operator that we
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
had I was looking at the books
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
she was embezzling
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
and that was my first initial
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
welcoming to bingo
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
um I've seen things over the years
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
there was a perfect storm that has been
 
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.810 align:start position:0%
there was a perfect storm that has been
recently

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
formed since November
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
that brought a lot of information to
 
00:20:28.919 --> 00:20:31.010 align:start position:0%
that brought a lot of information to
light

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
light
 
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.870 align:start position:0%
light
um

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
with what is actually being done behind
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
the scenes with
 
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
some organizations that I'm aware of
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
follow up to the follow-up no we're
 
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
going to move on and we're going to stay
 
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
okay and with all due respect I do want
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're focusing on this bill
 
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
and the wording excuse me of this
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
amendment and the wording of this
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
amendment we do have to be very careful
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
about suggesting that people are guilty
 
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
of things in this forum just get in
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%

representative Lloyd
 
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question so I work in
 
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
non-profit Finance
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
um and I know that with expenses uh
 
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
being reimbursed out to volunteers we
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
usually ask for some sort of paper trail
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
do you know with the organizations that
 
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
you're working with is there a set
 
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:52.940 align:start position:0%
process for paper trail and requiring
 
00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:57.059 align:start position:0%
actual printed receipts or I can only
 
00:21:58.970 --> 00:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
tell you for myself I have a log when
 
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
they sign in and they'll check off meal
 
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
gas that kind of thing there's no
 
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.630 align:start position:0%
gas that kind of thing there's no
receipts

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
receipts
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
they're just signing that they're
 
00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:09.299 align:start position:0%
getting the 25 reimbursement for those
 
00:22:09.299 --> 00:22:11.090 align:start position:0%
getting the 25 reimbursement for those
expenses

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.870 align:start position:0%
expenses
representative

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
yes please explain I'm here oh I'm sorry
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
please explain you said you were a
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
consultant and therefore you can get
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
paid is that what I heard you said yes
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
the rules within Lottery allow for
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
a consultant to get paid for their
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
services okay and in turn I have
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
subcontractors under me
 
00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
that they receive their Consulting
 
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
license and they're allowed to get paid
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
and how do you become a consultant
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
what's it take you 100 fee fill out an
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to keep going around
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
representative fellas did you have
 
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
something else
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
um yes so there's a distinction between
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
the Consultants who are essentially
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
employees and I assume that they
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
they have a W-4 and income taxes yes and
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
all of that yes and then there are
 
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
there's a different category of people
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
who are volunteers
 
00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:18.049 align:start position:0%
who are volunteers
and

00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
I I wonder in terms of
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
just this amendment I mean I think I
 
00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:27.059 align:start position:0%
think that we want to still allow
 
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
volunteers to receive some reimbursement
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
for their role I don't know I don't know
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you have a lot of
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
volunteers on in the games that you work
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
with or not but do you think that it's a
 
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:43.220 align:start position:0%
good idea to
 
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
delete the itemized expenditure because
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that people are not
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
doing that anyway
 
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
this this bill says it reimburses them
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm not quite sure what the
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
motivation was for that wording but so
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
well just what do you think of the idea
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
is so the current law says they can get
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed up to 25 and they have to
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
submit an itemized expenditure to you
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
know say how much
 
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.090 align:start position:0%
know say how much
um

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say receipts but itemized at
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
least what they're asking for and but
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
this amendment says they can get up to
 
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars now and they do not need
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
to submit an itemized list of
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures do you have a position on
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
that well I found that that being
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
striked was questionable I didn't know
 
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
why it would be but
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm opposed to the 50 because they
 
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
certainly even the volunteers can get
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
paid just
 
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
put aside the 50 do you think that
 
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:48.860 align:start position:0%
alumni eliminating the need to itemize
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
identify the expenditures that they're
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
being reimbursed for it's important or
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
or just assume do away with that
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
I would think it's a you know you have
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
gas you have your meal
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
um outside of that if if there's a rare
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
occurrence where you have child care
 
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
certainly that could be checked off on
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
your sign-in sheet or whatever
 
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.890 align:start position:0%
your sign-in sheet or whatever
um

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much other questions from
 
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you so much oh
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
representative elberger
 
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.890 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what a big old consultant
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
does could you just
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
what is it we don't know I don't know
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
what a consultant in a bingo setup would
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
do we're there we're organizing the
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
volunteers we're ordering the supplies
 
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.130 align:start position:0%
volunteers we're ordering the supplies
where

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
coordinating the structure of the games
 
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.810 align:start position:0%
coordinating the structure of the games
where

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
we do internal controls we do the
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
accounting we do the marketing we it's a
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
full-time job
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
it is a full-time job and then there's
 
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
people under us that we have doing
 
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
certain activities whether it's counting
 
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
tickets or taking control of the
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
Facebook pages and the postings and
 
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.769 align:start position:0%
Facebook pages and the postings and
um

00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
I I think the illusion of bingo
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
sometimes as you walk in you sit down
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
you play Bingo and everybody leaves
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
there's hours countless hours behind the
 
00:26:12.409 --> 00:26:12.419 align:start position:0%
scenes making Bingo the particularly our
 
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
Bingo the success it is
 
00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:15.769 align:start position:0%
Bingo the success it is
um

00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative okay please do not take
 
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
this question as argumentative I just
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
want to understand
 
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
you were arguing against raising from 25
 
00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
to 50 but you're pushing Consultants
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
will get paid I don't understand the
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
logic well I think once you get to the
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
50 threshold you're talking about an
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
hourly wage
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
and all of this money continues to go
 
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
untaxed including the cash payments with
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
the consultant if if you feel the need
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
to pay that individual more money for
 
00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
the services that they're providing
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
now you're you're coming into the
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
representative Janine
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question I guess I'm a little
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
confused when you say it goes untaxed
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
because they should only be reimbursed
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
for the expenses so it's a reimbursement
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
for expense not a wage that should be
 
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
taxed exactly but my my
 
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
issue and it has been for a very long
 
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
time are these cash payments that are
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
being made on in addition to
 
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
many of these Charities have never taken
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to write the 25
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement checks it was a running
 
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
joke when the investigators would come
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
in and say Rhonda you're the only one in
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
the state that's doing it well I we have
 
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
transparency we you know we have
 
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.230 align:start position:0%
transparency we you know we have
exposure

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:42.769 align:start position:0%
exposure
um

00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:42.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
so now that they're advocating
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
that this be pushed up to fifty dollars
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's questionable because I don't
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
believe the cash payments are going to
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
follow up uh so just so I understand
 
00:27:59.450 --> 00:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
um Charities have the ability to pay
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
Beyond this reimbursement they can pay
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
someone yes if they have a hold of
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
Consulting license okay so if they pay
 
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
them then the charity also has to issue
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
a 1099 correct so how are they not
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
paying taxes if they get the 1099 I mean
 
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
that would be no this is for the
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
volunteers if they're labeled a
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
volunteer and they don't have a
 
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
Consulting license okay so if the
 
00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:24.179 align:start position:0%
charity pays a volunteer
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's what you're saying then don't
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
they give the volunteer 10.99 no
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative self-worth
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
I thank you partly question for the
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
chair I mean I think these are very
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
important points and obviously because
 
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
this the Bingo issue comes to us often I
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
do think they need to be addressed
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
through the lottery they really don't
 
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with the amendment
 
00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:52.789 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with the amendment
so

00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
um I just see dividing it in half but I
 
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
do feel and I guess it would be through
 
00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
you that we perhaps should follow up on
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
the lottery on some of the regulations
 
00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
on Bingo for example are people supposed
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
to have checks or not that's really not
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
in our area but I think it's an
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
important question to answer
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
the rsas do state that all Bingo
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
expenses are to be issued with a
 
00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:18.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome okay
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
I don't have any more also oh uh sorry
 
00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:27.740 align:start position:0%
hi yeah
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
um so I I just want to make sure that
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
we're clear on this um because I do both
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
accounts payable and payroll in
 
00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:45.539 align:start position:0%
non-profit Finance
 
00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:48.539 align:start position:0%
um so generally when you have payments
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
made out to someone
 
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:51.299 align:start position:0%
um whether it's a volunteer or whatever
 
00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:54.419 align:start position:0%
once they meet that 600 threshold in
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
earnings at that point they get issued a
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
1099 statement and then that gets
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
recorded and reported to the federal
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
um the federal government for their
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
income taxes expense reimbursements
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
would only be for reimbursing
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket costs paid by volunteers
 
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
and those should be backed up by
 
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
documentation that's presented to
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
whatever group is paying these out so
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
these would be like you know if they
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
went to uh to go get pens for something
 
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
they would have a receipt for those pens
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
and they would they should be
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know easily documented so I don't
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
know I don't know if we're confusing
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
some of those terminologies
 
00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
um or or not but as soon as an employer
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
or as soon as I volunteer makes over six
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars it should be recorded on
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
a 1099 and reported right but they're
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
making over 600 most of these bingos
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
have double two sessions a week
 
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.470 align:start position:0%
have double two sessions a week
um

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
the the cash is not being recorded
 
00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.690 align:start position:0%
the the cash is not being recorded
anywhere

00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
could be more of a dra issue actually
 
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.590 align:start position:0%
could be more of a dra issue actually
than

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
so well it's a lottery issue just just
 
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
your follow-up on that question what
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
tell me explain who is getting the money
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's not being recorded and in your
 
00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:18.419 align:start position:0%
experience the volunteers I've seen it
 
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
I've seen it firsthand
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.970 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
the volunteer gets the money the cash
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
yes well no a check no cash
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
no you just said that every
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
reimbursement has to be paid by correct
 
00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
but what's happening in the industry
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
right now is they're getting cash fifty
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
dollars seventy dollars up to two
 
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and I'm saying that
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
raising the stipend from 25 to 50 is not
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
I do not believe it's going to change
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
that culture or that behavior
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
well that's an Enforcement issue yes
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
beyond the let beyond the scope of this
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
legislation again I just I'd like to
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
remind everyone folks here we're just
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
trying not to be accusatory of other
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
folks we certainly welcome other
 
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
people's opinion and how this would
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
affect you but I'm a little concerned
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
about yeah I'm just telling you my
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
observations what I have seen
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh other final questions
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
no thank you so much for coming today
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
okay are there any more uh Pink cards on
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 19 Amendment 1606.
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
representative Ames would it be
 
00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:34.610 align:start position:0%
representative Ames would it be
um

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
could we ask the lottery directly to
 
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
come up and talk about
 
00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.690 align:start position:0%
come up and talk about
uh

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:40.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
sorry I I my question is to the chair
 
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
and whether we might ask the lottery
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
director to come up and uh share with us
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
how the lottery addresses the review
 
00:32:59.950 --> 00:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
of uh the
 
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
reports on expenses by bingo organs that
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
Mr director and
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
um Chief enforcement officer would you
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
mind coming up and enlightening us thank
 
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:26.870 align:start position:0%
mind coming up and enlightening us thank
you

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
committee Charlie McIntyre and Hampshire
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
Lottery with me is Valerie King director
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement so she'll be answering this
 
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.950 align:start position:0%
enforcement so she'll be answering this
foreign

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
so the specific question I'm assuming is
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
how do we ensure that they're paying
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
their volunteers correctly
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
so it is a cash business so that can be
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to regulate we do rely
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
heavily on them reporting correctly they
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
are supposed to be paying by check
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
um any of the volunteer reimbursed any
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
expenses are supposed to be paid by
 
00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.750 align:start position:0%
expenses are supposed to be paid by
check

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.450 align:start position:0%
check
um

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what other questions you
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
are you open to further questions yes
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative Platt if they're paying
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
by cash how would you know
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
it would be similar to any business that
 
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
took cash in and cash out we'd have to
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
see it and encourage or somebody would
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
have to sort of submit it a verified
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
complaint with the basis of knowledge uh
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
and suggest to us that they saw X and Y
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
and then we'd have to investigate that's
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
there's a number of bingo halls and
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
there's only so many investigators and
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
they're also involved in other
 
00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:40.700 align:start position:0%
facilities investigations so
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
I will tell you this representative the
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
most difficult part of our job is where
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
cash and people are together
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
yeah can I just just a clarifying
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
question and you as you guys know I
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't involved in this industry a
 
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:55.379 align:start position:0%
um isn't it up to the charity to decide
 
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's the charity deciding is it worth it
 
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
for them to reimburse these volunteers
 
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
or not it's up to them to decide right
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
if it's in their best financial interest
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
or not am I right or am I totally wrong
 
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
yeah they're not required to pay
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement it's only a reimbursement
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
can be paid for actual expenses up to
 
00:35:20.569 --> 00:35:20.579 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative Leafly
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just to verify
 
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
this is all laid out in RSA
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
bingo halls are supposed to report
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
um the money they take in I imagine the
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
money that goes to the charity and then
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
of the money the charity receives it
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
would be up to them
 
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
to write a check to a volunteer
 
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.910 align:start position:0%
to write a check to a volunteer
um

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.430 align:start position:0%
 
whether

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
the charity does do does a charity have
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
to report separately
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
or is the bingo hall reporting
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
everything that came in
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
so it's the charity that's required to
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
do all the reporting the the commercial
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
Halls are only providing the space the
 
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
equipment they're not actually running
 
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
the games the charity runs the games
 
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay so when the charity
 
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
um fills out their paperwork to explain
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
how much money came in how much money
 
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
they made would
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
would there be a line for this or would
 
00:36:31.609 --> 00:36:31.619 align:start position:0%
this just come out of you know they made
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars it's their ten
 
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and if they choose to
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
you know spend it this way or that way
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
they don't need to report that to you
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
or is the volunteer part like a line
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
that gets reported to you it is a line
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
that gets reported okay thank you that
 
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
helps me understand
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative elberger I saw her hand
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
floating away and floating is the right
 
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
way to put it thank you madam chair
 
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
having been both a volunteer and an
 
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.270 align:start position:0%
having been both a volunteer and an
employee

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
I am very confused about what seems to
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
be a combination or
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
putting those words into meaning the
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
same thing if I'm a volunteer I assume I
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
do not get paid
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
if I'm a volunteer and getting
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for expenses that's not pay
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't understand why it would need
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
to be reported at all if I submit
 
00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:35.339 align:start position:0%
something saying I spent so much for gas
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
I spent so much on a babysitter whatever
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
the expenses might be but there would be
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
no reason to have to report that and am
 
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
I mistaken here
 
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
as far as reporting the reimbursements
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
it's more so that we can track profit
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
the overall how much is the charity
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
making so they have to report all their
 
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
expenses and subtract their expenses to
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
come up with their profit
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
of follow-up so
 
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
the volunteer who is getting reimbursed
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to do any reporting but the
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
charity needs to keep that information
 
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
and it's the Charity's responsibility to
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
correct correct and they they report it
 
00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
to us I'm not talking about any IRS I'm
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
just talking about reporting to us thank
 
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair okay other
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
hands up representative Southworth thank
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
you The Corner Spot
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
um two questions I think you've hit on
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
them a little bit so basically it's up
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
to the charity more than the person
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
whether they cross the 600 threshold
 
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
really both it should be but from your
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
right but yes it's up to the charity to
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
be letting us know how much their
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
expenses are and reimbursement is one of
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
the expenses but the key part is it's
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
not really your responsibility that's
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
the Charities like an employer and it's
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
their responsibility and with cash that
 
00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
of course is going to be tricky but my
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
other question I want to get back to the
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
amendment because that's really why
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
we're here
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
um can you just remind me
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
um it seemed like you didn't see a risk
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
when we were talking before about
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
raising it from 25 to 50. so I just want
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
to clarify that because that was my
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
sense that there really isn't a big risk
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
um we don't have any objection to it
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
being raised uh it's mostly that they're
 
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
reporting it correctly and that's our
 
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
bigger hurdle is is the actual reporting
 
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:43.619 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis thank you madam
 
00:39:43.619 --> 00:39:44.510 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis thank you madam
chair

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.130 align:start position:0%
chair
so

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:47.390 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you can share with us what
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
kind of oversight you have of the uh the
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
these charitable bingo games
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
um how how often
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
um is it particular charity
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
inspected by by your organization and
 
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
when they do get an inspection or an
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
audit I don't know if they look at the
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
books what are they looking at and
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
so we currently have I think we have
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
Three Investigators and they cover both
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
our Bingo and Lucky Seven which can be
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
outside of a bingo hall as well as our
 
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
games of chance they do rotate around
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
they'll check in on the Bingos various
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
bingos going on they can't be there all
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
the time and they're looking for things
 
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
that are visible at the time so you
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
trying to find out if someone is lying
 
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
on the paperwork it's not something
 
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
they're necessarily going to see when
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
they're doing an inspection
 
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.109 align:start position:0%
they're doing an inspection
oh

00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
so does that mean your your organization
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
is never looking at the accounting
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's done by these Charities so that
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
they could identify you know how how
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
much in is being paid to volunteers or
 
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
or the consultants and therefore there
 
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
are no like receipts to ask to look at
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing we do conduct conduct
 
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.849 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing we do conduct conduct
occasional

00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
occasional
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
um uh audits a handful each year there
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
are quite a few Charities so we're not
 
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
touching all Charities every year they
 
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
will look at the paperwork but again in
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
a cash business it can be hard if the
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
paperwork is missing or has been altered
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
it may not be easy to detect that
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
there's an issue
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
just just
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:44.780 align:start position:0%
when you say a handful of
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
audits of the paperwork each year and
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:53.099 align:start position:0%
I don't know however many 60
 
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
um Bingo charity groups and then you've
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
is this also in this pool is the gaming
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
gambling charity gambling is in that
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
same pool of the so
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
um Auditors usually go when they do
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
inspections they usually go for the the
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
where where there are the most
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
expenditures they don't offer audit the
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
little tiny companies you know so is
 
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
that also the case
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
um I mean obviously these are Charities

expect today thank you very much
 
00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:14.579 align:start position:0%
um oh representative only point of order
 
00:43:21.069 --> 00:43:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%

it's fine with me yeah
 
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:31.980 align:start position:0%
um and obviously uh we 10 o'clock might
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
be tight now I wasn't expecting that
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to take so much uh time so um
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
I can't do anything about that yet but
 
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll plan on being closer to 10
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
15. yeah on this Billet we just heard
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
what is the timeline on this does this
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
have a deadline or uh well we'd like to
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
try to get this exec today if possible
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
and remember Senate Bill 19 has the core
 
00:43:59.809 --> 00:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
Bill and then this is one of the
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
amendments there are two other
 
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
amendments we'd like to try to get it
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
done today it is on the calendar today
 
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
we don't have to
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh okay because I'm what I'm thinking of
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
is along the lines of maybe taking the
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
Cross out on this amendment that takes
 
00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:17.819 align:start position:0%
out the need for itemized receipts maybe
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be eliminated in just
 
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:22.740 align:start position:0%
straightforward why don't you discuss
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
that with your caucus and see what you
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
guys want to do on that um and then
 
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
we'll come back and see where we're at
 
00:44:31.609 --> 00:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
so could we if if we were if we go down
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
that path do so we could not exec on
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
that one today that would be I would
 
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
prefer to exec today if possible but
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
let's talk about it and see see we'll be
 
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
doing some struts some stropples so we
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
can move it along because it does seem
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
like when we come back that you can
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
quickly find out where people are at
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
well you know in a normal executive
 
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.750 align:start position:0%
well you know in a normal executive
session

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
um each person would you know move their
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment and we see if it goes forward
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
or not and then then we know right at
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
that point okay all right let's break
 
01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%

same thing as 1475 just in a slightly

okay other companies represent all me
 
01:29:54.410 --> 01:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to say you don't have to
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
put them in two different amendments
 
01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.010 align:start position:0%
put them in two different amendments
that's

01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh it's only for deciding whether
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
something's non-germaine I I did it that
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
way only because I did
 
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
1475 and then I got to point it out to
 
01:30:12.649 --> 01:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
me it's a different place on the law so
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
to put in another amendment you're right
 
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:17.219 align:start position:0%

1606 to SB 19 FN
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
representative elberger seconds would
 
01:31:39.729 --> 01:31:39.739 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion
 
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
and this is a pretty simple amendment
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
that simplifies a bit the uh law on how
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
Charities are allowed to compensate
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
their own volunteers uh and increase
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
doubles the amount of money they are
 
01:32:01.810 --> 01:32:01.820 align:start position:0%
allowed to compensate them
 
01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
because there hasn't been an increase in
 
01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
a long time and it's harder to get
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%

uh thank you madam chair
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%

01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
sb20 reducing the fees for Keno
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
licensing as an ought to pass motion as
 
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
an opt to pass motion thing is there a
 
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:10.860 align:start position:0%
second second representative elberger
 
01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:13.490 align:start position:0%
second second representative elberger
seconds

01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:20.820 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair I think the
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
reducing the fees for Enterprises to get
 
01:36:26.689 --> 01:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
involved in Keno licensings gives more
 
01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
people the opportunity I think the
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
current fee is five hundred dollars it
 
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
is rather High I think this will give
 
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
more opportunity for operations to be
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
involved and in enhancing revenue for
 
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire thank you
 
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee
 
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:36:50.169 --> 01:36:50.179 align:start position:0%
um yes I don't support this bill because
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
I I don't think any business who
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
thinks they will profit by having Keno
 
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't can can afford the 500 fee and
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
if you eliminate that fee and it does
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
proliferate which I'm not sure that you
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
really pick up
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
too many more you might pick up more
 
01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
businesses but there will be low volume
 
01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
that that just spreads the cost
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
spreads the need for inspection over a
 
01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
wider array of businesses and that could
 
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
be an additional expenditure for the
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
lottery so I I don't you know I don't
 
01:37:35.450 --> 01:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
see any big financial gain to the state
 
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
for doing so so I'm opposed to this
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you want to say
 
01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:48.470 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you want to say
anything

01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:37:52.129 --> 01:37:52.139 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none the clerk will call the
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
roll oh sorry representative thank you
 
01:37:57.050 --> 01:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just for clarity
 
01:37:59.649 --> 01:37:59.659 align:start position:0%
the the way I understood the testimony
 
01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
with the Advent of uh convenience stores
 
01:38:08.209 --> 01:38:08.219 align:start position:0%
and the like uh offering Keno where they
 
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
were having to pay out Keno tickets and
 
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
not getting the advantage of selling
 
01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
Keno this addresses directly an extra
 
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars that those vendors
 
01:38:22.490 --> 01:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
would have to pay in the periphery of
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
that it eliminates the fees for uh
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
people that pour alcohol and serve serve
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
food but in the fact it's uh it's this
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
piece here is taking away uh the fact
 
01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
that President Keno licensees presence
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
sorry Lottery licensees can now sell
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
Kino and will not incur the extra 500
 
01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:51.649 align:start position:0%
Kino and will not incur the extra 500
fee

01:38:51.649 --> 01:38:51.659 align:start position:0%

eighteen one and one not present

the vote being 18 to 1 ought to pass
 
01:39:53.209 --> 01:39:53.219 align:start position:0%
motion passes uh I believe with one
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
person uh opposed to the majority report
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
it can go on consent uh your reports
 
01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
you're putting it on okay so without
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
objection we will request to go on
 
01:40:03.719 --> 01:40:06.050 align:start position:0%
objection we will request to go on
consent

01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
and we will now close the executive
 
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.729 --> 01:40:27.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.770 --> 01:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
we will now open up the executive
 
01:40:33.169 --> 01:40:33.179 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 120 relative to
 
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming license applications
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
wages stakes and bonds and for the
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
record I am involved in this industry
 
01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:47.149 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
Spielberg

01:40:47.149 --> 01:40:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.649 --> 01:40:48.659 align:start position:0%
I move
 
01:40:51.850 --> 01:40:51.860 align:start position:0%
OTP and will offer an amendment
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
on SB 120. is there a second for the
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet seconds
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh and uh would you like to you
 
01:41:06.890 --> 01:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
have an amendment did you say
 
01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:08.990 align:start position:0%
have an amendment did you say
yes

01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
so I think everyone understands that SB
 
01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:16.500 align:start position:0%
120 largely parallels hb607 passed by
 
01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:18.179 align:start position:0%
this committee and out of the house the
 
01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
amendment number is the amendment number
 
01:41:23.689 --> 01:41:23.699 align:start position:0%
is one five seven seven h
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
so the the bill
 
01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:33.719 align:start position:0%
is largely making changes to definitions
 
01:41:37.370 --> 01:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
technical uh enforcement related changes
 
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:39.659 align:start position:0%
changing some license fees but the
 
01:41:42.169 --> 01:41:42.179 align:start position:0%
amendment focuses specifically
 
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
on section 14.
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
which is uh on page eight and nine of
 
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
the bill the amendment itself couldn't
 
01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
be simpler it simply says delete section
 
01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:54.950 align:start position:0%
be simpler it simply says delete section
14.

01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
14.
 
01:41:58.729 --> 01:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
so what's section 14 would do
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
is it would eliminate from current law
 
01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
specific instances of violations
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
segregated into three categories by
 
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
degree and those are defined as minor
 
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
moderate and major
 
01:42:18.410 --> 01:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
simply leaves this language in current
 
01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.790 align:start position:0%
simply leaves this language in current
law

01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
the reason for the amendment is twofold
 
01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
number one as I had pointed out when we
 
01:42:30.890 --> 01:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
had our executive session on hb607 I
 
01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
think it is a big step backwards to
 
01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
remove specific instances of violations
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
which show degree and even though the
 
01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
commission is allowed to find other
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
instances because the language says this
 
01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:44.109 align:start position:0%
instances because the language says this
is

01:42:44.109 --> 01:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:42:48.290 --> 01:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
not limited to at least it allows them
 
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
something that they can set at a
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
commensurate level
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
so it does a disservice to the current
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
law to eliminate these the other reason
 
01:42:59.890 --> 01:42:59.900 align:start position:0%
why it would have to be amended anyway
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
is because
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
unlike hb607 which addressed minor
 
01:43:10.330 --> 01:43:10.340 align:start position:0%
moderate and major violations this bill
 
01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:13.139 align:start position:0%
addresses only minor and moderate and is
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
silent on Majors so it only did
 
01:43:17.169 --> 01:43:17.179 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the job
 
01:43:20.810 --> 01:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
so anyway I think we should all be
 
01:43:24.050 --> 01:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
perfectly content with the statute the
 
01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
way it is and the way that the
 
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
commission has been interpreting it
 
01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:29.699 align:start position:0%
their rulemaking is currently well
 
01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
founded there's no reason to change this
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
part of the law so please support the
 
01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:36.830 align:start position:0%
part of the law so please support the
amendment

01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
1577. oh representative Phillips yeah I
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
would just like to say that
 
01:43:46.199 --> 01:43:48.169 align:start position:0%
would just like to say that
um with

01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
um with
 
01:43:51.250 --> 01:43:51.260 align:start position:0%
that I support the amendment because
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
without it the it makes the situation
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
about trying to decide you know what
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
kind of violations going on way too
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee seeing
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
none the clerk will call the role on
 
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on Amendment 1577 on SB

01:45:29.470 --> 01:45:29.480 align:start position:0%

01:45:54.649 --> 01:45:54.659 align:start position:0%
said earlier
 
01:45:57.649 --> 01:45:57.659 align:start position:0%
House Bill 607
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
did I have the right number
 
01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
um which was passed by this committee
 
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
and then passed by the house and sent to
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
the Senate where
 
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
it resides somewhere
 
01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:11.689 align:start position:0%
it resides somewhere
and

01:46:11.689 --> 01:46:11.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:11.699 --> 01:46:12.590 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:46:12.590 --> 01:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:18.050 --> 01:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
it uh is not entirely the same as as
 
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
this bill 607 is not entirely the same
 
01:46:24.410 --> 01:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
as SP 120 but it's similar and has many
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
of the same details in it but one detail
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
um is uh the uh a change in the amount
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
of a single wager by a player in any
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
game of chance
 
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
Uh current law
 
01:46:45.970 --> 01:46:45.980 align:start position:0%
sets they shall not exceed
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
for such single Wagers of ten dollars
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
would change that to fifty dollars going
 
01:46:58.850 --> 01:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
from ten to fifty dollars for a single
 
01:47:02.689 --> 01:47:02.699 align:start position:0%
wager 607 House Bill 607 the bill that
 
01:47:03.890 --> 01:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
we passed
 
01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
did change this provision but moved it
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
from ten dollars to twenty five dollars
 
01:47:14.810 --> 01:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
I think moving to fifty dollars is uh is
 
01:47:17.810 --> 01:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
too big a leap for me to swallow I I
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
accepted the 25 but did it uh heightens
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
the risk for players of course they can
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
make a choice to wage at lower levels uh
 
01:47:32.209 --> 01:47:32.219 align:start position:0%
assuming the Halls were there uh they're
 
01:47:35.229 --> 01:47:35.239 align:start position:0%
playing uh or gaming
 
01:47:39.169 --> 01:47:39.179 align:start position:0%
allows lower wages but uh
 
01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
um they uh are really unrestricted in
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
their ability to go to the higher level
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
which is five times the current level
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
and I think it's it's more risk than I
 
01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
can accept so for that reason as it
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
stands I uh I intend to vote against
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you one
 
01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
material difference between two material
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
differences between this and 607 which
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
is in the poison maidens Committee of
 
01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate and they've been holding on
 
01:48:21.050 --> 01:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
to it to see what we're going to do I
 
01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:22.669 align:start position:0%
to it to see what we're going to do I
believe

01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
um is
 
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
the theft by deception which I think was
 
01:48:33.649 --> 01:48:33.659 align:start position:0%
a good catch uh and the moratorium which
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
on this committee has agreed to go along
 
01:48:38.209 --> 01:48:38.219 align:start position:0%
with the Senate version of
 
01:48:42.890 --> 01:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
so if we turn this bill down they would
 
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
have to amend
 
01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:47.450 align:start position:0%
have to amend
there's

01:48:47.450 --> 01:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
ours the way they want to and and send
 
01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
it back for concurrence or not
 
01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:56.149 align:start position:0%
it back for concurrence or not
and

01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
I agree with my colleague that going up
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
to fifty dollars from 10 all at once is
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
pretty much of a leap without trying the
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
intermediate step thank you
 
01:49:13.729 --> 01:49:13.739 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee
 
01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:15.659 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet
 
01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just uh add into
 
01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
this being the prime sponsor of 607 and
 
01:49:24.189 --> 01:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
that limit being 25
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
I went into that knowing and and into
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
digging into that what we have for a
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
model in charitable gaming the the
 
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
normal player goes in there at least
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
from what I understand and there are two
 
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
dollar five dollar player
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
this targets a different demographic of
 
01:49:45.609 --> 01:49:45.619 align:start position:0%
people that may go down to Encore and
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
may capture those folks to stay in the
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming halls in New Hampshire
 
01:49:54.530 --> 01:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not necessarily opposed to a 50 bet
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
limit but to make the assumption that
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden a two dollar play is
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
going to stop betting fifty dollars is
 
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
is just that presumptive and I don't
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna see
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
you know proliferation of that uh I've
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
been in these rooms spend some time in
 
01:50:15.169 --> 01:50:15.179 align:start position:0%
in structuring and writing 607 and and I
 
01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
think I know I don't think it's going to
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
have a Major Impact it's going to allow
 
01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
to broaden the appeal to some people who
 
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
are bigger Gamers uh than normally as
 
01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
seen in the uh
 
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming rooms in the state but
 
01:50:34.609 --> 01:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
I don't see a a big problem with 25 to
 
01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
50 either
 
01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
other comments from the community
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
um yes just along the same line of 25
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
versus 50 for the increase one of the
 
01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
things that we heard from testimony is
 
01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:50.699 align:start position:0%
that there were concerns that the
 
01:50:54.050 --> 01:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
Charities might not have on hand enough
 
01:50:58.250 --> 01:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
money available to pay out the winnings
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
if if things just you know went you know
 
01:51:04.370 --> 01:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
in one one you know some sometimes there
 
01:51:06.169 --> 01:51:06.179 align:start position:0%
are big Winners sometimes there are not
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
and we heard that for as a concern for
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
607 when we were talking about 25
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
dollars so that's just another concern
 
01:51:17.930 --> 01:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
just to clarify because I do remember uh
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
that bill but they were referring to I
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
believe it was Lucky Seven
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
just under a whole different set of
 
01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
statutes not this
 
01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm looking over there so he's he's
 
01:51:31.250 --> 01:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
the he's the author of 607 so he would
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
know that that's the testimony I
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
remember Madam chair was about the Lucky
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
Sevens and nothing left
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay other comments on the ought to pass
 
01:51:43.010 --> 01:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none the clerk will call the roll
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
did we vote on the amendment I lost
 
01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
track I Apologize yes it was 19-0 on the
 
01:51:52.010 --> 01:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
amendment so now we're doing the final

worried about the revenues for next year
 
01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:29.689 align:start position:0%
worried about the revenues for next year
and

01:56:29.689 --> 01:56:29.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh the year after and having no idea
 
01:56:36.649 --> 01:56:36.659 align:start position:0%
that nobody except the business
 
01:56:39.770 --> 01:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
concerned has any idea how much Capital
 
01:56:44.270 --> 01:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh investment on companies that we get
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
taxes from are going to be making this
 
01:56:50.330 --> 01:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
year uh
 
01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:52.310 align:start position:0%
year uh
we

01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:56:56.090 --> 01:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
won't know whether that would add
 
01:56:59.209 --> 01:56:59.219 align:start position:0%
substantially or not at all to our
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
revenue losses next year if the other
 
01:57:06.050 --> 01:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
things that are hitting us all all hit
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
in the worst way at the same time so
 
01:57:14.290 --> 01:57:14.300 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is it can on
 
01:57:16.970 --> 01:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
extends in the same way that the tax
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
cuts and jobs act did but on just a
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
little modified so that it only covers
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
three years it it takes the we've had
 
01:57:31.129 --> 01:57:31.139 align:start position:0%
three years already in which we have
 
01:57:33.530 --> 01:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
been on
 
01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:34.910 align:start position:0%
been on
taking

01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:57:38.930 --> 01:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
a thirty percent thirty percent and
 
01:57:41.870 --> 01:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
thirty percent and 10 percent at the end
 
01:57:45.410 --> 01:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
of the capital investment interest
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
income as a deduction interest payments
 
01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
is a deduction and
 
01:57:56.570 --> 01:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
on what we are going back to is what we
 
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
had three years ago which was that they
 
01:58:02.570 --> 01:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
took the whole thing as a deduction in
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
the same year and we've been doing that
 
01:58:08.209 --> 01:58:08.219 align:start position:0%
for a very long time and the tax cuts
 
01:58:11.930 --> 01:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
and jobs act uh changed that because we
 
01:58:13.689 --> 01:58:13.699 align:start position:0%
did not decouple
 
01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
a lot of other states have decoupled
 
01:58:19.609 --> 01:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
and um we
 
01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
on what so what this does is it says
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
we're decoupling
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
from this and but on for the next three
 
01:58:36.890 --> 01:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
years a third of the cumulative on carry
 
01:58:39.890 --> 01:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
forwards from these three years that
 
01:58:41.089 --> 01:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it thirty percent
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
thirty percent thirty percent ten on a
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
third will
 
01:58:51.350 --> 01:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
be taken every year on top of whatever
 
01:58:53.930 --> 01:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
on interest
 
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
deduction you're taking
 
01:58:59.570 --> 01:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
for this past year
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
so I hope I'm explaining that clearly
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
enough on so that we will only be
 
01:59:09.890 --> 01:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
responsible each year for the next three
 
01:59:12.669 --> 01:59:12.679 align:start position:0%
years for the current Year's
 
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
introduction plus a third of the carry
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
forwards from the years before
 
01:59:21.770 --> 01:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
on and then after the three years we'll
 
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
be back to where we were
 
01:59:27.229 --> 01:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
seven years ago
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing that we've always
 
01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:30.169 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing that we've always
done

01:59:30.169 --> 01:59:30.179 align:start position:0%
done

02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
yeah we I'm not sure because of the
 
02:03:40.129 --> 02:03:40.139 align:start position:0%
fiscal note sometimes I do sometimes
 
02:03:41.570 --> 02:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
they don't but we'll request it and if
 
02:03:43.370 --> 02:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
they don't we'll be ready to speak to it
 
02:03:45.890 --> 02:03:45.900 align:start position:0%

02:03:59.209 --> 02:03:59.219 align:start position:0%
yes uh the question was when will we
 
02:04:01.370 --> 02:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
meet again and I think we're going to
 
02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
meet next Tuesday
 
02:04:06.410 --> 02:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
uh let's say 10 A.M
 
02:04:09.649 --> 02:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
and we will do at a minimum Senate Bill
 
02:04:12.890 --> 02:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
49 and see what else we can get done at
 
02:04:14.689 --> 02:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
that point I don't and I don't know if
 
02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
we'll have anything else to do at the
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
point so we'll see
 
02:04:20.810 --> 02:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
about two other builds
 
02:04:24.050 --> 02:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
for hearings no no no oh for executing
 
02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:27.050 align:start position:0%
for hearings no no no oh for executing
yeah

02:04:27.050 --> 02:04:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
