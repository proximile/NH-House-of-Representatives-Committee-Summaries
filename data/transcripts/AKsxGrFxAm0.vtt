minor change uh to the state retire
 
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh health insurance plan and this was

brought to my
 
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
attention uh about a year ago was after
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
the bill filing period by uh by a
 
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
constituent uh who is a recent um uh uh
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
State employ retiree uh uh State uh
 
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
state employee and um and said that uh
 
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
said that he was hoping to be able to
 
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
keep his um their children on their plan
 
00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 align:start position:0%
but um but the their children were I
 
00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
think 24 25 years old and they they were
 
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
you know out of college now and and the
 
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.470 align:start position:0%
you know out of college now and and the
current

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
law with respect to um to eligibility of
 
00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
children between the ages of 19 and 25
 
00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
requires uh children to be a full-time
 
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
students so um not being able to to put
 
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
a bill in last year uh we did get a
 
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of research um help to uh
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
take a look at it what is the Affordable
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
Care what is federal law require and
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
federal law actually requires um uh
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
eliminating the um the the limitation on
 
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
um on children between the age of 1925
 
00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
most plans can no longer require uh
 
00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
those children to be full-time students
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
but those CH those um changes through
 
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
the Affordable Care Act at the federal
 
00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 align:start position:0%
level don't apply to uh to the state
 
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
retiree plan and I don't remember all
 
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
the details why um why the state retiree
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
plan does not need the comply with that
 
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
Pro uh provision of the federal law but
 
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
um but all this um all this bill does on
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
lines uh three and four uh are just
 
00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
removing the uh the limitation if
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
full-time students so um any fully
 
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
dependent minor children between the
 
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
ages of 19 and 25 could be carried uh on
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
a um uh on the family plan for a for a
 
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
um a retired state employee and I do
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
have some remarks
 
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
actually from our constituent uh with
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
respect to their situation and what uh
 
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
what prompted uh the request and uh if
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
you don't mind Madam chair I just if I
 
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
could just read it into the reckon I can
 
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
leave leave you with a copy or I can
 
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
leave us with a please summarize it and
 
00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
leave us with a copy and we'll read it f
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
fantastic so um so our um uh our our
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
constituents uh both um both turned UH
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
60 years old in March of 20 23 they uh
 
00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 align:start position:0%
they served the state as state employees
 
00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 align:start position:0%
for more than 56 years of service um uh
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
their children are both recent graduates
 
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
recent graduates of University of New
 
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they're early in their
 
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
careers and um and they're they're
 
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
wishing to be able to to keep them on uh
 
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
their um their their
 
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh their state retiree health insurance
 
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
policy until they turn uh 26 and it's
 
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
important to know and I think the um the
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note also States this that the
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
premiums on these policies are fully
 
00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 align:start position:0%
paid by the retie they're not paid for
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
by the state um uh that's that's one big
 
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
big point on this second big point on it
 
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
is is um we're bringing young kids young
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
people into the into the plan which
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
generally have a lower cost um um on
 
00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 align:start position:0%
them than um uh than than than than many
 
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
others so um so we're hoping that um
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
that this committee would look favorably
 
00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
on on on on House Bill 1292 and
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
recommend it ought to pass so thank you
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
very much I'm happy to take any
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative laus thank you
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
this is actually for uh the chair and
 
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
that is I don't see Mr Carlin here do
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
you know if anyone's here from the
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
retirement system because I have a
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
question for them this does not involve
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
the retirement system oh Department of
 
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.270 align:start position:0%
the retirement system oh Department of
administrative

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
Services which is ready to testify but
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
hasn't given me op pink card yet uh will
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
administers this program I'll wait till
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
car is not involved I understand I'll
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
wait till she's
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh okay representative
 
00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
manuti thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:45.639 align:start position:0%
representative luno for taking my
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
question so these youngsters are
 
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
currently on the retirees Health Plan
 
00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
correct and they are asking to retain
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
them because they are not students
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
have graduated from student right so so
 
00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
th this was you know as of a year ago so
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
I don't believe they're still on the
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
plan because they'd already graduated
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
from the University of New Hampshire um
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh but um but but I don't think our
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
constituents in this case are
 
00:08:21.309 --> 00:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily the only constituents in the
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
state that may have um similar situation
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
where where either either they what
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
would want to bring um uh children onto
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
a family plan as opposed to just paying
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
paying out of pocket for just the um the
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
two-person plan they'd be paying out of
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
pocket for the family plan and um and I
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a it's certainly a
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
nice benefit with uh with really no cost
 
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:49.720 align:start position:0%
to the U to the state uh to uh to to to
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
be able to um um you know help uh our
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
retirees who have committed um uh
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
significant service to all of our
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
needs thank you other
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
education okay and this is
 
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the fin D
 
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair so again Joyce
 
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
Pitman I am the director of risk and
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
benefits with the Department of
 
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
administrative services and we run the
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
retiree health benefit
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
program um I marked support um what I'm
 
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959 align:start position:0%
really here is to answer your questions
 
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
I assumed you'd have some from a retiree
 
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
Health Plan perspective um as far as the
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
language and the bill goes we don't have
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
any concerns with this um for a couple
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
reasons um the biggest one one is that
 
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.030 align:start position:0%
reasons um the biggest one one is that
currently

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
today in order for dependents to be
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
covered under the retiree health benefit
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
program the retire is responsible for
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
100% of the cost of that plan so our
 
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
first concern is how is it being paid
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
for and it is being paid for by the
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
retiree um
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
we this is typically a lowcost
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
population to serve they're typically
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
younger they typically don't have a high
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
um cost Demand on the health care system
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
but um I think I heard a question being
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
asked as to why the federal government
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
why we exempt from that this is a
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
retiree health benefit program and the
 
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act refers to active
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
employee health benefit plans so the
 
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
retiree health program is outside of the
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act also referred to as
 
00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:48.550 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act also referred to as
the

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
AA um so we are not required to cover
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
dependence however
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
um although indeterminable of how many
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
people will actually utilize the system
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
the retiree is paying the full cost of
 
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
that coverage so we have no reason to
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill um and it honestly from
 
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
an Administration standpoint some of
 
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
these I'll say dependents um go to
 
00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
school after high school to college and
 
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
then so they are according to the bill
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
as it is the law today they're staying
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
on their parents' health benefit plan
 
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:25.720 align:start position:0%
until they're out of school they're no
 
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
longer full-time students so with By REM
 
00:11:30.509 --> 00:11:30.519 align:start position:0%
moving that full-time student
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
requirement it's irrelevant if they go
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
to college or not once they're over the
 
00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:37.959 align:start position:0%
age of 19 they remain on the plan until
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
through age 25 which does also align
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
with the Affordable Care Act so it just
 
00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
allows the student to stay on longer so
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
to some the students have been on beyond
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
the age of 19 because they had
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education and some didn't
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
and they would remain on the plan I'm
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
representa so I just want to be sure
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
that if we were to um pass this bill and
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
turns into statute it would not have a
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
cost to the people of New Hampshire it
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
would be strictly a polic health
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
policies that are paid by the retirees
 
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
correct the retiree would be responsible
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
for the full cost what we call the
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
working rate which is the full cost of
 
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
the plan so correct that would be what I
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
can't guarantee is that um if you look
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
on a member by member basis remember
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
it's a larger risk pool right so um they
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
working rate or what they pay it's just
 
00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:32.839 align:start position:0%
under $1,000 a month per um the way the
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
premium structure is is you pay for one
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
dependent so if you have three children
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
that are on the plan you pay for one um
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
and it's roughly about $1,000 doar a
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
month just just under I think it's
 
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
9883 per month um so whether or not that
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
exceeds that I'm not sure but it would
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
be applied to our regular calculation in
 
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.189 align:start position:0%
be applied to our regular calculation in
the

00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
future so are you saying that if you
 
00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
have three children you pay for one and
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
the other two are covered
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay that's true today that's that's
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
typical of family plans you get any
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
number of children included that's
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
correct representative leas thank you uh
 
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
so related
 
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't remember if this plan
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
the state self-insuring or it's through
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
something else but my question is I mean
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
if it's self-insuring and somebody has
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
three children and it is going to cost
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
presumably the plan more for the other
 
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
two uh but if if it's part of some deal
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
or you move to a family plan then then
 
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the other two aren't going to cost
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
more so can you answer which it is
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
basically if there's if there's more
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
than one child is it really going to
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
cost the people in New Hampshire more
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
money according to our actuaries no it's
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
they do an Actuarial calculation to
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
figure out I think your question is if
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
$983,000 correct um the way the the math
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
works out the answer is no it it comes
 
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
out of the working rate so in a future
 
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
rate we would take whatever that cost
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
was and it would it could potentially
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
inflate the cost that retirees pay in
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
the future but I just want to remind
 
00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:17.759 align:start position:0%
people that this is a very small
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
population and they're typically very
 
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
healthy so the chances of this doing
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
anything to the cost of the retiree
 
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
health benefit plan is really it's
 
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
indeterminable but it's minimal if
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
anything okay thank you yes represent
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
man py thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
question so this is youngsters that are
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
just getting off or getting on their own
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
two feet and any time they can
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
transition out of their parents plan and
 
00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:51.509 align:start position:0%
transition out of their parents plan and
would

00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
this impact dual enrollment or you
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
know um if whether or not it impacts
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment it depends on the health
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
benefit plan if they what the other
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
plans are typically when you stay on our
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
health benefit program it's primary um
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
if there is another plan they could look
 
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759 align:start position:0%
at the coordination of benefits specific
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
to that plan um and as far as them being
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
youngsters so we're talking really when
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
they graduate from high school up
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
through age
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
25 um so I'll let you decide whether or
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
not they should be on their own it's
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
every parents you know family decision
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
but um yes it's a way of helping them
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
transition into when they transition off
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
of their parents and it allows it to
 
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
happen after they're age 25 if they have
 
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
an employer plan available to them or
 
00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:41.079 align:start position:0%
something like that it does put it in
 
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
alignment with the Affordable Care Act
 
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
which is exactly what our active
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
employee population has today thank you
 
00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:50.269 align:start position:0%
employee population has today thank you
other

00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.710 --> 00:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
much is is there anyone else who wishes
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
1292 don't see anybody in that case I'm
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
hearing okay all right since we have a
 
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
few minutes uh we will go into executive
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
session and representative groa has a
 
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:23.800 align:start position:0%

1292 is there a second second second by
 
00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
represent of gold do you wish to speak
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
to your motion thank you Madame chair
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
this um Bill offers of the retirees the
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
same benefits as someone on the ACA and
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
since it doesn't since the retiree is
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
responsible 100% for the um fees I think
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a good benefit for New
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirees who have families
 
00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:52.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirees who have families
represent

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
GS no further comment Jackie said at all
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay repres representative man py thank
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think this gives
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
a good opportunity for young Workforce
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
to stay in the state and you know we are
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
facing that entry level so this will
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
give their youngsters a peace of mind to
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
have the medical benefit and then
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
explore opportunities in New Hampshire I
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a great benefit thank you
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
anyone else comments questions yeah I'd
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
like to say that increasing the size of
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
the pool in this health plan with
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
younger healthier people than your
 
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.190 align:start position:0%
younger healthier people than your
average

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%

7 so this bill was brought forward um
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
due to a constituent uh letting me know
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
that under current
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
law the that in a divorce div divorce
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
decree if one
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
spouse uh has a retirement system with
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and in that
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
decree uh they get to get a portion of
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
that retirement
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
system um you know no
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
problems however I when talking with
 
00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.350 align:start position:0%
problems however I when talking with
this

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
constituent um she was nearing Social
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
Security age
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
and uh was
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
collecting uh what was in the divorce
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
decree uh because the spous had retired
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
a monthly uh stipend I guess is what
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
I'll call it and um So based on the
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
amount uh she filed for Social Security
 
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.389 align:start position:0%
amount uh she filed for Social Security
was

00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
retiring and lo and behold the former
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
spouse says you know what yeah I'm going
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
to go back to work soon so now you no
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.789 align:start position:0%
 
stien

00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
stien
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
and under New Hampshire law if somebody
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
goes back to work even if the spouse is
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
already collecting the funds and relying
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
away because apparently in the system
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
when some one goes back to work their
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits stop and they keep
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
system this has created a hardship and
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
in speaking with this person they had
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
also let me know that uh the
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
person that they dealt with in regards
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
to this has had told her that she had
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
other people calling up crying because
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
they would lose their houses over
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
this now I'm not
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
for people that are do the money that
 
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
haven't started collecting to get the
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
money but if the spouse retires and then
 
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:08.839 align:start position:0%
decides to go back to work and in this
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
case we believe it was retaliation based
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
on her comments I don't know if that's
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
true or not I'm just relaying the
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
story um Force this person back to work
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
full-time they were already working but
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
then also put them over the limit to
 
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
make ends meets so now that their ta
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
Social Security is now
 
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
taxed so it was kind of like a double
 
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
whammy because they collected early so
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't there's a certain age
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
where you can only make so much money
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
under the social security
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
system and so I brought this forward I
 
00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
spoke with OS he said the commissioner
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
said that this was a rare rare occasion
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
that this happens um according to s um
 
00:34:59.550 --> 00:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
when they did the
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
research or legislative research I
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
should say
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
so I put in this simple line that says
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
that if you've already started
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
collecting because your spouse had
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
retired the payments don't cease to the
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
other spouse if it's in the divorce
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
decree that's it it's not saying
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
everyone gets to start collecting or
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's only if it's
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
already started that it can't stop
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
because if it's hurting one person it's
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
hurting others as we know how things go
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
but people don't know where to go and
 
00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
and how to come forward I just happen to
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
be in a place where someone told me
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
about this and I felt that this really
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
needed to be addressed and I'm open for
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
Smith if a spouse goes back to work C
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
can you hear I'm not sure this is close
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
to enough I'm sorry
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
um you just turned it
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
off Hightech I can't do
 
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
it okay if a if a spouse goes back to
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
work then he's or she is going to earn
 
00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
more money that will increase the
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
retirement for that person will it also
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
increase the retirement for the spouse
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
Representative no it's a set amount in a
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
decrease so that amount does not
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
increase okay so the person receiving it
 
00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
at originally will get only that amount
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
correct thank you thank you okay it also
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
depends on this former spouse retiring a
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
second time which may be
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
delayed okay anyone else question
 
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.550 align:start position:0%
delayed okay anyone else question
representative

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
um P this a little closer um would it
 
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
not be true that a person in such a
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
circumstance would uh be eligible to go
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
to court
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
to pursue having support from their
 
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.349 align:start position:0%
to pursue having support from their
former

00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
former
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
spouse uh thank you for the question um
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
I did ask that question but it's
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
costly and so it's a hardship uh for
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
funds but they could yes represent
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
BR I'm under the impression that if you
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
have to go to court and you don't have
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
the funds the court can provides a
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
service for you is that not
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
true um thank you for the question I'm
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
really not familiar with all of this
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh however um the amount of time
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
and then the time out of work because
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
they did have to go back to work
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
and wasn't uh they didn't seem to think
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
that it was the right thing to do and uh
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
they just decided uh that they would cut
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
their losses at this time that the
 
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.790 align:start position:0%
their losses at this time that the
requirement

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.670 align:start position:0%
requirement
for

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
um representation is for criminal
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
actions if you're suing in family court
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
you don't you're not
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
entitled uh thank you for that
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
clarification because they did say it
 
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
was going to be quite costly for
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
them okay anyone else represent man py
 
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um this is very
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
similar to child or alimony kind of
 
00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
thing so you go back to the court or go
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
back to the settlement if there is a
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
change in life status isn't it so that
 
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
would warrant if there is a change in
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
the Life
 
00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
status uh you would go back to change it
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question and
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
looking at this but this here in this
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
particular case um that I'm aware of is
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
it was kind of an I gotta moment it was
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
an ret they said you know what we're
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
going to go back to work even though
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
they were at retirement age and
 
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.750 align:start position:0%
they were at retirement age and
collecting

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
retirement because they wanted to harm
 
00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.550 align:start position:0%
retirement because they wanted to harm
this

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
person all
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.750 align:start position:0%
person all
right

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you very much
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%

facts out and then hear from
 
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:44.390 align:start position:0%
facts out and then hear from
representative

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair for the
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
record Marty Carlin representing the New
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system uh the uh
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
nhrs has not currently taken a position
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill although we do have some
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
some uh legal concerns with existing
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
statute and the Internal Revenue code uh
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the application of the the
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
bill um historically you know as under
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
current law nhrs permits shared payment
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
qualified Domestic Relations orders
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
referes quadros this is a divorce decree
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
or settlement uh adjudicated in court
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
and we apply that court order to any
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
distribution of retirement benefits or
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
other assets um as we don't you know we
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
we just we just qualify it but the
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
courts make those decisions on who gets
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
what and so those can be a you know a
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
flat amount of a pension they could be a
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
percentage of a total pension there
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
there's different very permutations on
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
that but essentially what that's what
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
the law allows that to happen is for
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
that that member's benefit to a portion
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
of it to be paid to someone else because
 
00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:53.079 align:start position:0%
of a you know a divorce decree or
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
divorce settlement however that that
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't make the the quadro recipient a
 
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
member so our concern under curent La is
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
if the member um you know the the
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
they're deriving a benefit as a portion
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
of a retired member's benefit and if the
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
retired member isn't is is no longer
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
retired there's no benefit to receive a
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
portion of um you know we would be
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
essentially having to pay a benefit to a
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
non-member which is which is not allowed
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
it's you know under very statutes and
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah all right that's a very interesting
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
position representative M py and then
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative G thank you madam
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
chair it was very you explained it very
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
clearly in uh interesting perspective
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
but how would this impact your whole New
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system by tweaking
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
this is a non-member getting the benefit
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
access to the benefit it it's it's um
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
you know there there is a both in in the
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code and in in um uh
 
00:42:10.589 --> 00:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
statute and in the Constitution there's
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
a clause you know for the um exclusive
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
benefit of members and beneficiary so
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
providing any um any relief to a
 
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
non-member would arguably someone could
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
say that's not violates the exclusive
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
purpose rule because it's not a member I
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
mean the dollar amount certainly with
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
the size of the benefits we pay isn't
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
the issue it's it's the question of
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
opening the door to taking trust fund
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
assets which were you know member and
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
employer contributions and investment
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
income and dispersing that to to someone
 
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
who's not was not a plan member you know
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
for for a benefit I mean it's different
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
if a retire a member retires and can
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
leave a survivorship option to a
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
beneficiary there's a whole legal
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
pathway for that and certainly
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
non-members get money from us but this
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
is an issue that may be more the perview
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
of of civil court
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
to this in this unfortunate situation
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
facing representative scho thank you
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
question my question
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
is if
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
um the current statute and and procedure
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
is a former a retired employee and their
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries wouldn't a former wife
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
that a court has declared entitled to a
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
portion of it fit under a beneficiary
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
category um well if if you're you can be
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
nominated as a beneficiary you know for
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
an active member if there's a death Ben
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
benefit payable to whoever the nominated
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
beneficiary or beneficiaries are you
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
know but in this case it's it's a
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
beneficiary for pension that no longer
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
exists because the person was restored
 
00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
to service so so there's no base benefit
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
from which to draw a portion of okay and
 
00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
follow so in in the event the court has
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
ordered a flat fee you don't have to
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
calculate anything um can you tell us
 
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.030 align:start position:0%
calculate anything um can you tell us
how

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
many circumstances you currently have
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
where you're paying these um exp spouses
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
based on court orders uh we we have
 
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.309 align:start position:0%
based on court orders uh we we have
approximately

00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
650 Quadro benefits paid out of uh more
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
than 43,000 benefit recipients so um you
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
know so that that's that's
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
the that's the universe and and you know
 
00:44:51.069 --> 00:44:51.079 align:start position:0%
they're you know again there's they can
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
negotiate or the court could order
 
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
different distributions and different
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
things some of them um you know but but
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
you know we apply them as they come in
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
okay and one last follow up thank you
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair and so
 
00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
um do I remember my
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
followup and how many
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I forgot my followup any
 
00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.589 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I forgot my followup any
other

00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions so if if I understand your
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
testimony you're saying
 
00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:26.559 align:start position:0%
that with a court order you'll pay
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
whatever is
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
required if the the person returns to
 
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
work and rejoins the system there is no
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
pension to be split and the EXP spouse
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
may have no other relationship with the
 
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.150 align:start position:0%
may have no other relationship with the
pension

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
pension
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
system when that re person retires again
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
which I presume will happen does the the
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
court ORD still apply it it should
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
unless it was changed because you know
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
it it governs when when the the
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
distribution of a pension benefits so
 
00:46:01.549 --> 00:46:01.559 align:start position:0%
when the person you know retires or or
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
retires again okay thank you that's
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
important to know yes representative
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
gold I collected my thoughts thank you
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
and wrote them down this time okay so
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
when the retiree goes back to work they
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
are now there's no um pension active
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
pension benefit in place because they
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
are no longer withdrawing money out of
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
the system and instead they're adding
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
money into the system correct correct so
 
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
my question goes to um something
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative leus usually ask which is
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
cost to the system or the taxpayers or
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
the workers and that would be wouldn't
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
this uh fiscally be a benefit in a way
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
that the retirees gone back but this
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
person's still getting a set fee that
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
they previously
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
got is that am I making sense to you I I
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
think so and I'll I'll try to answer it
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
and if if I'm going down the wrong path
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
but I mean you know as essentially you
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
know the you know the members have
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
always been allowed to return to
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
full-time employment after retirement an
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity comes along or or whatever
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
reason uh there's a job that they feel
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
is a good fit for them and you know in
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
that case you know the pension stops and
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
they're they're acre additional service
 
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
they're contributing more money so
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know their pension is is
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
going to be probably larger than it was
 
00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
um you know because um you know of the
 
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
additional time they're they're putting
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
in so when they collect the benefit
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
there's more it's it's somewhat neutral
 
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
you know cost-wise to the system for
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
that because if if it was a full-time
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
permanent position somebody would be
 
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
working in it we'd still be getting
 
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
contributions in the you yeah so um you
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
know but but the the the carve out of
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
the paying an allowance to someone else
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
I mean that that's just money coming out
 
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal advantage to that you
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
know even if even if it was legally
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
permissible you know it's just it's
 
00:47:59.790 --> 00:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
additional money I mean it um again I I
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
understand not firsthand but I
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
understand court cases can cost the
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
individuals a lot of money but if the
 
00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
person is working full-time and making
 
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
more of a salary there may be an
 
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the the spouse
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
to get a piece of that um to to make be
 
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
made whole through that
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
questions get represent black thank you
 
00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
so um given that this doesn't allocate
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
any money to the retirement system for
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
the cost which I guess would be hard
 
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
because it's not defined but anything
 
00:48:41.069 --> 00:48:41.079 align:start position:0%
you did did have to pay out under this
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that in effect um you know
 
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
after the readjustments increase the uh
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
unfunded acred liability payments that
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
all the Employers in the state have to
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
pay even if it's by a little bit but
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
that's where the money would come from
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it would be in the you know
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
farther out in the rounding if it if
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
it's a oneoff but it may not be we've
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
got several hundred of these I mean I
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
certainly relationships end amicably or
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise and and you know there there
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
could be other individuals affected by
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
this and if we're paying benefits to
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
nonmembers or retirees you know when it
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
gets larger then you know the the plan
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
qualification issue comes up again as
 
00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:22.799 align:start position:0%
well as the funding issue okay thank you
 
00:49:22.799 --> 00:49:23.710 align:start position:0%
well as the funding issue okay thank you
other

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:39.589 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
representative

00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
Pearson got you
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
okay good morning the record
 
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve Pearson Rockingham
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
District 13 which is encompasses
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
Dairy um I am not in favor or oppose to
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
this bill I wanted to especially hear
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
what Mr Carlin had to
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
say I want to bring up two
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
points uh the first point is that in the
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire a spouse can
 
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
commit infidelity in this case and still
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
especially in group two walk away with
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
50% which I which I have a problem with
 
00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
we are a state that does not recognize
 
00:50:22.349 --> 00:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
that as some other states do so just
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
keep in mind
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
that through that's a situation that can
 
00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:31.799 align:start position:0%
occur this the second thing here is that
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about where we're going
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
down the road here in the sense
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
that if if we start to dictate
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
how things
 
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
function whether you know in in in an
 
00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
Essence we're not removing the ability
 
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
of the employ to go back to work but
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
we're certainly tying something to it my
 
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
concern is that later on we're going to
 
00:50:56.589 --> 00:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
get to the point where a spouse or a
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
court will tell someone they can't
 
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
retire or they have to retire to provide
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
a former spouse of benefit because they
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to wait so that's that's the
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
problem here is that I'm concerned about
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
where we're going with
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
this uh based on the fact that we've
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
we've had a system in place for quite a
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
long time so the conditions of group one
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
and group two are different when it
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
comes to divorce so just please keep
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
that in mind as well whereas in group
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
one you're going to have a a settlement
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to have an agreement
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
whereas in group two the spouse
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
automatically gets 50% regardless of
 
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
what that spouse
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
did so again like I said I'm not
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily for or against I have
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
concerns now based on what Mr Carlin
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
said about the constitutionality of this
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
based on the way the retirement system
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
is mentioned in our constitution in
 
00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:49.950 align:start position:0%
is mentioned in our constitution in
article

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
article
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
36 and in the general operation of the
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
system in relationship to the IRS rules
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
I think that that really requires some
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
more deep look here to make sure that
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
this is even possible regardless of
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not the house wants to do
 
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
this or
 
00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:11.559 align:start position:0%
not so that that's where I am with that
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm let's just call it
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
caution thank you R Schmid has a
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam
 
00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
chair so the the question I have it was
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
already slightly addressed but the in
 
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
reality uh the the system is already
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with I I believe Mr Carlin said
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
something like 600 I believe it 600 out
 
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.510 align:start position:0%
something like 600 I believe it 600 out
of

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:52:44.789 --> 00:52:44.799 align:start position:0%
43,000 yeah for round numbers so that we
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
we already have established a at least a
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
pattern of paying out and I think we
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
have to try to adhere to
 
00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:57.559 align:start position:0%
the if it's it's a oneof in every case
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
that's 600 one
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
offs that's not a system anymore so
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
could you address that issue I'll try
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
Peter because I'm not entirely sure what
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
you just asked
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
me thank you representative Pearson I
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
think we can all agree on that I I'm not
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not entirely sure as far as does 650
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
events equal 650 individual one-off
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
cases again I I'm not sure because I we
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
would need to see the breakdown between
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
group one and group two with that
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
because the conditions for the two
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
groups as far as divorce are are not
 
00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
equal okay other
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
testimony does anyone else wish to
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
1435 okay then I will close the public
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
hearing and go into executive session
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
representative Shu you have a
 
00:53:59.900 --> 00:53:59.910 align:start position:0%
motion Madam
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:01.430 align:start position:0%
motion Madam
[Music]

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
chair uh yes I would like to move in
 
00:54:07.789 --> 00:54:07.799 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on House Bill
 
00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
1435 is there a
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
second r on leus second is that LE you
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your
 
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
motion yes it it appears uh that this
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
would violate um probably IRS rules and
 
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
State um retirement system would be
 
00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
hardpressed to come up with a logistical
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
reason to make such
 
00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
payments represent leus um thank you I
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
agree the only other comment I would
 
00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
have is that I mean if this is more than
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
an extremely rare Circumstance the
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
family courts could take you know put
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
some provision in the original agreement
 
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
as to what should happen in the case
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
that the pension goes away I mean that I
 
00:54:56.589 --> 00:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
don't think that I don't know that that
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
would take statute it could just be
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
practiced at court but I believe the
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
family court can make whatever
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
stipulations they like right so I mean
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
if this is a big enough problem then
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
they could do something like that if
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
they chose or you know be good if we
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
could do something to make civil court
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
cheaper but anyway uh I agree with the
 
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%
schm uh I I agree with the the motion uh
 
00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:25.799 align:start position:0%
and the thing is that the courts are
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
where you do
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
individual dispositions based on
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances rather than
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
having the statutes having to dance all
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
over the place I think is unwise so as
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
much as I can feel that uh it's an
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunate circumstance it's not for
 
00:55:49.029 --> 00:55:49.039 align:start position:0%
the legislature to deal with it's for
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
the courts to deal with in my
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you anyone else comments
 
00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:55.910 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you anyone else comments
questions

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan thank you madam
 
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
chair I we received testimony that this
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
particular case the the uh male
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
individual probably want wanted to harm
 
00:56:07.599 --> 00:56:08.470 align:start position:0%
individual probably want wanted to harm
the

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
constituent um through this action I
 
00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
don't while I don't disbelieve the
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
testimony we received I don't think we
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't have an indep
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
independent evidence of that um and also
 
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
in this case the
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
individual uh confessed that they didn't
 
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
have the indiv the ability to pay for
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
the legal cost to take the individual
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
court so if you if you think of the
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
reverse of that if this were to pass
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
then those who
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
can bear the cost of going to court
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
would no longer have to bear those costs
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
they would benefit from from this uh
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
change so with that in mind I I I agree
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
with the the inexpedient to legislation
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative gold I just
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
had a question on um the statement that
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative Shu made regarding uh
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
breaking IRS rules I didn't hear that
 
00:57:14.029 --> 00:57:14.039 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr I miss it commented on the
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
fact that the IRS rules for I believe
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
forbid making payments to someone who is
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
not either a member or a beneficiary is
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
that correct Mr Carla yeah okay thank
 
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.510 align:start position:0%
that correct Mr Carla yeah okay thank

you
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and the connection to the system is
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
broken once the pension ends could I
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
please ask everybody to put their mouth
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
near the microphone because it is
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%

excuse
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%

here

01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair thank you for
 
01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
the promotion I appreciate
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
that and good morning uh members of the
 
01:01:04.029 --> 01:01:04.039 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
Brian will I'm the president of the
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters of New
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we represent approximately
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
2,000 active and retired firefighters uh
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
state I would like to thank
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
representative groda for introducing uh
 
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:01:21.789 --> 01:01:21.799 align:start position:0%
1352 uh this was a bill that uh we
 
01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
requested um bipartisan sponsor ship on
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh based um on a few factors this bill
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
does a few things here um and I'll just
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
walk you through it uh first you'll see
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
on uh line 10 of page one firefighting
 
01:01:40.349 --> 01:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
station wear has been defined um nowhere
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
in current statute to my knowledge uh is
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
this something that is defined uh
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
station wear just for everyone's um own
 
01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
knowledge is essentially your uniforms
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
that you wear uh day in and day out to
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
the fire station um
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
and you conduct all of your duties in uh
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
and then when you were responding to um
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
what we call an idlh or a situation that
 
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
is immediately dangerous to life and
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
health that we then Dawn our firefighter
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
turnout protective equipment uh over the
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
top of those uniforms so um we have
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
defined what firefighter station wear is
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh if you look further down the page um
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
the area of uh line
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
26 um it clarifies some language that is
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
in there currently
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
with firefighter PPE I think it's
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
wellknown fact now that our personal
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
protective equipment comes manufactured
 
01:02:39.549 --> 01:02:39.559 align:start position:0%
with past chemicals actually built into
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
it um it is in current law now that if
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
that is the case the manufacturer is
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
required to um Supply a letter stating
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
that the firefighter PPE can contains
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
past chemicals uh and that letter is to
 
01:02:59.789 --> 01:02:59.799 align:start position:0%
be maintained in the employees personnel
 
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
file um what we're trying to do here is
 
01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
to put additional pressure on the
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturing companies um to do
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
something about our turnout gear that
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
has p in it um things are not happening
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
at the rate that we'd like to see them
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
happen at um so we want them to uh
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
identify whether firefighters turnout
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
gear does or does not contain pfast
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
chemicals now What's significant about
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
this is there is currently no turnout
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
gear on the market that has been tested
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
scientifically and proven to not have
 
01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
pfast chemicals in it however there are
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturing companies that are
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
claiming that their gear does not
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
contain pfast
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
chemicals what we're attempting to do
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
here is to get the manufacturer on
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
record to State whether the gear does or
 
01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:55.720 align:start position:0%
does not have those those chemicals in
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
it further we'd like uh a letter uh not
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
only to be placed in the employees
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
personnel file um but to ensure that
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
there is proper documentation of this
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
the employee should also be provided the
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
same documentation directly um and and
 
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
we do know for reference there are fire
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
departments um not not intentionally
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
doing so but that are unaware that this
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
law currently exists on the books and we
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
have found that um some fire departments
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
are not in fact supplying these letters
 
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
in Personnel files so we want to it's an
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
additional layer of safety that we want
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
to uh ensure that we take care
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
of uh on page two and line nine uh there
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
begins another piece to this because of
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
the uh manufacturing industry and the
 
01:04:51.349 --> 01:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
the pressures that we're putting on them
 
01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
on an international level they are
 
01:04:53.559 --> 01:04:54.870 align:start position:0%
on an international level they are
researching

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
researching
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh Alternatives that do not have these
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
chemicals in them um it's we would
 
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
contest that when these new generation
 
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
of firefighter turnout gear becomes um
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
becomes available that our fire
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
departments should give preference to
 
01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
those uh those
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
specific uh articles that do not have
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
the pasas in
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
them um most departments um if not all I
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
believe all should have in place a
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
routine Gear replacement program
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
firefighter turnout gear has a shelf
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
life of 10 years um so if I were to get
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
a set of turnout gear tomorrow uh in
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
theory it needs to be replaced within 10
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
years the request here is to make it
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
such that if there is a new generation
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
of turnout gear uh that is a safe
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
alternative that becomes available um
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
during a Department's normal replacement
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
plan that it would be given preference
 
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh over the gear that is known to have
 
01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh be manufactured with intentionally
 
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
added pfast
 
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.230 align:start position:0%
added pfast
chemicals

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
chemicals
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
um until such time and and you look in
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
subsection B that a safe alternative is
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
provided to the employee um we would ask
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
that fire departments shall have in
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
place a policy that limits unnecessary
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
exposure to firefighting turnout gear um
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
this is not to say that the normal
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
day-to-day duties uh we should not be
 
01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
wearing our turnout gear um when it's
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
most appropriate to do so we acknowledge
 
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is still the safest
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism to protect our firefighters
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
from an idlh environment uh what we're
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
asking is that we limit exposures uh for
 
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
instance firefighters out
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
um standing by of a wire down or a power
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
line down um potentially wearing their
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
turnout gear because it's cold outside
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
or directing traffic in the snow with
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
their with their cat on because it's
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
cold outside or raining um or uh
 
01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
training in it that is not necessary for
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
your job function um some fire
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
departments have uh allowed firefighters
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
to Dawn their firefighter PPE and go on
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
um a rower or a treadmill for exercise
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
um there is training that needs we need
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
to on this gear 4 there is training that
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
we don't um that is up to the fire chief
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
um the management to determine what is
 
01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
necessary and what is not so we would
 
01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
ask that there is there exists a policy
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
in every Department uh that that makes
 
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.109 align:start position:0%
in every Department uh that that makes
that

01:07:40.109 --> 01:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
determination and uh by January 1st uh
 
01:07:47.269 --> 01:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
2025 fire department shall not have uh
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
as an option for wearing a firefighter
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
station wear that contains intentionally
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
added pasas and I listed a few there um
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
this is from a study from the
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
International Association of
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
firefighters where they determined that
 
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
some of those uniforms that I spoke
 
01:08:06.029 --> 01:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
about earlier actually also contain fire
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
resistive chemicals uh that are
 
01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
carcinogenic in nature and giving our
 
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters cancer um there are
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
alternatives on the market in fact we
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
used to wear them many many years ago
 
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
and these would just be your organically
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
treated Cottons that do not have
 
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
intentionally added chemicals
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
um the the tradeoff that some might
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
contest is that okay it doesn't protect
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
you in in superheated environments and I
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
think that that's
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
fair um but I can tell you uh in this
 
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
day and age the the number of fires that
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
our firefighters are exposed to uh have
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
decreased which is good on all fronts um
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
but we're still wearing this these
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
uniforms every single day to do every
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
single function um so we need to
 
01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
identify the risk vers benefit there um
 
01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
so that sums up um all of the pieces of
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
this bill it's it's somewhat
 
01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and I recognize that um I
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
would like to address uh on page two
 
01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:11.070 align:start position:0%
would like to address uh on page two
line

01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
10 um if I could offer and I've spoke
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
with representative goalie Who's the
 
01:09:18.349 --> 01:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor in this um a small
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh on page 10 to strike the
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
words shall be required
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
to and replace it with the word
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
should and the reason for this is uh in
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
conversations with some other
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um there was a a little bit
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
of angst as to whether or not um this
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
created an unfunded mandate and or uh
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
put fire departments in a position uh
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
where we were asking them to do
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
something that was
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
unreasonable um meaning if there's a
 
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
new uh generation of turnout gear that
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
becomes available able that does not
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
have past chemicals in it but it lacks
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
in other function functionality that we
 
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
need for the job or the cost is
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
extravagant or um the availability is
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
too scarce based on every fire
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
department and the nation trying to get
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
at it um we don't want our firefighters
 
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
walking around without some sort of
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
turnout gear as I mentioned we still
 
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the fact that it is the
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
safest um mechanis M that we have in
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
place to protect our members um from an
 
01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
ideal AG so I would ask that that uh
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment be submitted so that um we
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
just uh we would we would deal with
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
those um concerns and I'd be happy to
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gold thank you
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
question my question is um having heard
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
this testimony when we were addressing
 
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
increased cancer screening because of
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
the pat in the in the gear turnout gear
 
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
last year and
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
having so much of my family be
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
firefighters and and in um
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
Administration in the firefighting
 
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
Fields um it was shocking how many did
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
not understand the risks that were in
 
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
the P um and I did quite a bit of
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
research so my question to you is um
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a lot of very
 
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
promising research on wool as being um
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
part of the solution in moving forward
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
in sec second generation firefighting
 
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
have you are you aware of that and do
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
you think that um the people making
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
these decisions that we're talking about
 
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
and by the way I support the should
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
instead of sh be um language change but
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
are you aware whether this uh how how
 
01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
well people are staying on top of the
 
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
trends and what's coming out for
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
Alternatives thank you for your question
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
representative um I'm extremely
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
confident our uh we're a state affiliate
 
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
of the International Association of
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
firefighters uh which represents 343,000
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
firefighters across the United States
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
and Canada and this is by and large
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
their number one um issue that they're
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
working towards right now um this has
 
01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
become a federal uh fight and New
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um by our cancer legislation
 
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
that we passed last year um with the
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
presumptive law uh in the cancer
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
legislation that we saw um supported in
 
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
a senate committee a couple of weeks ago
 
01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is on the map as one of
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
the one of if not the most Progressive
 
01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
state in the nation that's paying
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
attention to this issue um so we are
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
paying attention to the the research um
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
we are paying attention to the data that
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
comes out of the research um and the
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
International Association of
 
01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
firefighters has run um tests on on both
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
firefighter station Weare and
 
01:12:59.629 --> 01:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
firefighting turnout gear um and they're
 
01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
working with the manufacturers to
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
determine what the best alternative is
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
um it it's it's a little bit it get the
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
M the waters get a little bit muddied
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
because there are three layers to
 
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
firefighter turnout gear and some layers
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
with some manufacturers have p in it
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
whereas others don't but those others
 
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
have pasas in their other layers so
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
we're trying to find the ability to mix
 
01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
and match here thank you thank you
 
01:13:26.910 --> 01:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
represent Dolan and then
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um and thank
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh while I'm very concerned about the
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
safety of our
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
firefighters um and I I do acknowledge
 
01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
the the amendment uh that you're
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
proposing uh what I'm concerned about is
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
during this period of of a
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
transition from the old G old gear to
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
the new gear with without P Fass in it
 
01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh is there any protection from
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities from a legal standpoint
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
that they don't get if they if they turn
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
out their firefighters for incident
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
especially the
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh more poorly funded departments in the
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
state or maybe volunteer forces or
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
whatever if they turn them out with with
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
past contaminated equipment during this
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
trans because they haven't a chance to
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
upgrade what protects them from legal
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
liability that that they have introduced
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
Pas chemicals to these individuals is
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
there any
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
protection thank you representative um
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
my short answer would be I don't know
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
the answer to that um but I would
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
say that right now as it stands every
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
Fire Department in the state of New
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is acknowledging the fact that
 
01:14:49.149 --> 01:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
they're putting their firefighters in
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
danger and at risk by putting them
 
01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
mandator putting them in firefighter
 
01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
turnout gear that is Laden with pfast
 
01:14:59.629 --> 01:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
chemicals in all three layers um that is
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
an acknowledgement now and what I can
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
tell you from um an international
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
perspective is that there are um they
 
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
have watched this
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
they we're all concerned about the same
 
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
things and the idea here is not to um
 
01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
get anybody uh to to violate uh a state
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
law but also we're trying to be
 
01:15:24.669 --> 01:15:24.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable in the language here to
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the fact that this may not
 
01:15:26.239 --> 01:15:27.229 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the fact that this may not
happen

01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
overnight and we want to try and work
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
with the employers to get it done as
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
soon as possible as a as a follow thank
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
you as a follow-up question followup uh
 
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
would you object to an amendment that
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
that limited the liability to the local
 
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
municipality for this issue while we're
 
01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:46.470 align:start position:0%
municipality for this issue while we're
in

01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
transition representative Dolan I think
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
the requirement the personal protective
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
equipment replacement program
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
implies that there will be a
 
01:15:59.709 --> 01:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
transition um but if you can think of
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
some good good legal language well that
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
might make some
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
sense representative I could tell you I
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation yesterday um about
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
something similar and we were talking
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
about the gear rep replacement program
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
um that's a replacement program that
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
Although our shelf life has 10-year
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
lifespan um our Administration Within
 
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
our fire departments determines what our
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
Gear replacement program will be um that
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
happens now it that wouldn't be a change
 
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
so maybe the Gear replacement program is
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
five years maybe it's 10 um but there
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
would be some ability for the chief the
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
the department and whatever elected body
 
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
they have that oversees a a budgetary
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
need or whatever would be able to make
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
the decision uh as to how to best
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
implement the program thank you sh it
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I call your
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
attention to the bottom of the first
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
page lines 29 and 30 the added language
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
and a copy of the same shall be provided
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
directly to the employee and I see a
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
comma there I don't mean this to be
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
nitpicky I'm serious uh was there
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to be more language after that
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
that inadvertently got deleted needed or
 
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
was is that Comma just a typo I believe
 
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
it's just a typo thank you okay a period
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
after that sentence representative laus
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I'm uh I'm pretty
 
01:17:39.149 --> 01:17:39.159 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the um unfunded mandate
 
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
thing so uh I appreciate the amendment
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
you suggested and certainly I couldn't
 
01:17:44.629 --> 01:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
have supported that without that but I
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
have a related question so starting line
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
18 um it requires that um you know they
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
must not be provided the option of
 
01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
having station wear that has some of
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
this stuff in it and the question is um
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know in general I know may vary but
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
in general it's the station we paid by
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
the employer or the employee and if by
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
the uh employer you know how much is
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
this going to cost because this has to
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
be in place as I understand it by the
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
beginning of next year and if it's you
 
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
know most of the the wear out there has
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
these things and all of it's going to
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
have to be replaced this year uh at
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
least as I read this and so how much is
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
that going to be because that could be
 
01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
seen I think as an unfunded mandate to
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
the uh municipalities thank you
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative um first and foremost
 
01:18:38.189 --> 01:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
there is uh under current state law um
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
and and I can't cite it for you now but
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
I can certainly try and find it for you
 
01:18:44.669 --> 01:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
um a law which states the employer must
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
provide the uh uniforms if they require
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
uniforms to be worn um what this does
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of in the fine print here
 
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
shall not provide as an option uh the
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
wearing of so essentially what happens
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
right now in our fire departments is a
 
01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
firefighter gets a in most cases a
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
uniform allowance right that may be $500
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
a year and they're told you need to have
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
navy blue pants uh uniform shirts
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
whatever else black boots all these
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
things um and in most cases they are
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
provided a list of optional items if you
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
want to buy a winter hat if you want to
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
buy a baseball hat if you want to buy a
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
sweatshirt you can do these um as as an
 
01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
option what we're saying here is the
 
01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:37.790 align:start position:0%
option what we're saying here is the
fire

01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
fire
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
resistive uh clothing will not be
 
01:19:43.149 --> 01:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
allowed as an option for the employee to
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
purchase so um it would be incumbent
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
upon the
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
employee to make sure that when they're
 
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
using their uniform allowance they're
 
01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
purchasing the right items oh followup
 
01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:56.719 align:start position:0%
follow up okay so as I understand what
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
you just said that option is for the
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
option of what they can purchase when
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
they replace their existing uh equip you
 
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
know clothing uniforms and they're going
 
01:20:09.149 --> 01:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
to buy new ones however this says it
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
shall not provide as an option the
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
wearing of firefighter station we which
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
to me says that starting January 1st
 
01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
they would be prohibited from wearing
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
any existing uniforms they have if they
 
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
contain any of these things which means
 
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
they would need to be replaced the ones
 
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
that have that stuff in them would all
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
need to be replaced before the end of
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
the year um and so that is a uh um you
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
know Mandate of uh replacing equipment
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
that presumably would not need to be
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
replaced that early at least not for
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
everybody thank you I me is that my
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
understanding correct or yeah your
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct I I would say
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
if it
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
um if the the date needs to be amended
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
we can amend the date I would be happy
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
to do that that would mean that um to my
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge there's no Department that
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide the uniform allowance on
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
an annual basis um so that the passage
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
of this law in theory one year after
 
01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
that you would be getting a new a new
 
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
uniform allowance anyhow all right thank
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
you okay yes
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
represent thank you madam chair just to
 
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
follow up on that I think I'm hearing
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
two different things to if I understand
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
correctly Tony asked you if starting on
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
line 18 this bill would mandate that
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
every Department replace all turnout
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
Gear with non-p no this is not about
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
turnout GE all right so the I know what
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
it that he's that you're talking about
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
$500 uniform allowance that employees
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
get so is that what your you were
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
questioning is that they not I
 
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
understood this was the station wear or
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
not the turnout gear and that's what I
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
was asking about all right okay thank
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
thanks okay repres
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
man thank you madam s thank you for
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question so this applies to
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
both um fire departments in a city or a
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighter correct anybody
 
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
who's a firefighter in the state abides
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
by this and do the volunteer
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
firefighters also get allowance to buy
 
01:22:21.590 --> 01:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
the gear I am unaware of how the
 
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.189 align:start position:0%
the gear I am unaware of how the
volunteer

01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
01:22:23.199 --> 01:22:24.350 align:start position:0%
volunteer
uh

01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
firefighters operate um but I'll to my
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge most most volunteer fire
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
departments would not get a uniform
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
allowance but they would then be
 
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
provided with a a shirt um most don't
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
have in theory a full uniform that they
 
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
wear this would be for the professional
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
departments the full-time
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
departments um by representative Pearson
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
is volunteering to explain how VI
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
volunteer fire departments deal with
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
with this so if you could hold your
 
01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
question on that he'd since Mr real
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't know the answer represent laus
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully a brief uh thing related to
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
that so on the section starting on page
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
two line 18 if it was changed to say
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
something like um you know starting
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
January 1 2025 they they shouldn't uh
 
01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
provide a purchase option for new
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
clothing uh that contain that stuff and
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
then maybe at a later date um let's say
 
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
2026 beginning of
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
2026 um you know they they shouldn't
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
require them to wear it or permit them
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
to wear clothing I would be supportive
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
and and supportive followup real quick
 
01:23:38.669 --> 01:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
so do you know follow okay thank you um
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
so is the cycle of replacement of this
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
station wear typically like yearly I
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
mean they get the if they get the
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
allotment yearly do they typically turn
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
over that stuff every year yeah um
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's really nothing um proprietary
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
about station wear it's you know it's
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's clothes that you could go buy at
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
any department store these are just
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
treated with with past chemicals that's
 
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's the piece that we're trying to
 
01:24:08.189 --> 01:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
avoid um so if you think of it uh no
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
different than a suit you may wear here
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
every day uh at some point you're going
 
01:24:14.669 --> 01:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
to have to turn over those articles and
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
buy new ones so um yes I will tell you
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh in every fire department that I'm
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
aware of across the state people are
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
replacing their uniforms on an annual
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
basis okay thank you other
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson I thank you Edna good morning
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
for the record Representative Steve
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
Pearson Rockingham District 13 which
 
01:24:48.159 --> 01:24:49.430 align:start position:0%
Pearson Rockingham District 13 which
encompasses

01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
encompasses
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
dairy uh as many of you know I've I've
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
been in the fire service for 27 years
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
both in the paid career side of things
 
01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
and also in the volunteer side so I'm
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to I can address a couple of
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
things and and um president will from
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
the pffnh uh gave you a great
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
explanation of a a holistic thing I can
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
provide you a practical day-to-day
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
reality for me and just to just to give
 
01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.070 align:start position:0%
reality for me and just to just to give
the

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:18.709 align:start position:0%
the
my

01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
perspective um from my own circumstances
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
as far far as the volunteer fire service
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
it depends on if the volunteer
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
department requires something specific
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
the second they do now under because
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
they're still employees under the labor
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
rules they are now required to have
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
their uniforms either provided or
 
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
clothing allowance given to them if the
 
01:25:42.669 --> 01:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
volunteer fire department does not have
 
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
any sort of requirement as to what they
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
wear which generally they don't because
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
if you're cruising around in a pickup
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
truck and the pedra goes off you're not
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
going to rush home to change your
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
clothes right so in those cases you're
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
you could be in jeans and a t-shirt or I
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
have fought fire in a suit well part of
 
01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
a suit before so between my the two
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
weeks of my grandfather so you never you
 
01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
never know what you're going to be
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
wearing so that that's the
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
differentiation there representative
 
01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
leus is is it has to do with it is the
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
requirement of the of the specific
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
Department uh a lot of departments now
 
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
especially in Rockingham County and
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County have day Crews where
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
they're hiring pums or they have some
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
folks that might work a shift or two a
 
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
week in the cases of those folks require
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
having a required uniform that
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely is falls under labor labor
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
standard now
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
the it the the situation and I'll give
 
01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
you an example of my my own Universe in
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
for the the first 15 or so years of my
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
career we wore Hanes cotton t-shirts
 
01:26:47.109 --> 01:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
that had silk screen on them hes cotton
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
t-shirts are not treated with Pas at all
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
they're um they're they're no different
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
than any other t-shirt you can buy from
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
any retailer they just would they would
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
just have silk screen or embroidery put
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
on them and then we got a little bit
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
more formal and went to a type of a
 
01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
collared shirt that was made by a
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
company called 511 that
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
provides uniform type shirts to lawn
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
emergency services and others
 
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately around a year and a half
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
and ago we learned that the
 
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
511 products contain pasas I am still
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
required to wear that shirt despite the
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
fact that for a very long time we wore
 
01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:31.719 align:start position:0%
hannes cotton t-shirts or Fruit of the
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
Loom cotton
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
t-shirts so as far as the and we're
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
talking station wear here as far as the
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
ability to acquire station wear that
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
would get us out of this pest business
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely no burden of any kind it
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
that Hanes cotton T-shirts they make by
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
the Millions though that's that's not
 
01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
difficult at all as far as and it's no
 
01:27:57.629 --> 01:27:57.639 align:start position:0%
different than the pants I think that
 
01:27:59.390 --> 01:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
the main thing of course when you use
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
the word uniform is is the definition of
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
uniform that all of your folks are the
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
same so having having been in the in
 
01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:09.669 align:start position:0%
same so having having been in the in
this

01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
business prior to having a little bit
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
more simple uniform but certainly a
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
pfast free one that's not an issue now
 
01:28:19.149 --> 01:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
as far as clothing allowances go one of
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
the things that my department has is a
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
no excuse Poli policy for uniforms that
 
01:28:25.709 --> 01:28:25.719 align:start position:0%
are unsightly right because we have a
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
clothing allowance in my particular case
 
01:28:28.830 --> 01:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester it's every 6
 
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
months so if you have a collar that's
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
frayed or you have a button that's
 
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
missing there's no excuse for you right
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
because you get a clothing allowance and
 
01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
you are expected to have a proper
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
uniform so in this case this enables or
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
requires I guess kind of a little bit of
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
both the sense that with a with a dated
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
Line in the Sand we're going to do this
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
now now whereas that is a
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing issue for turnout gear it
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
is absolutely not an issue for station
 
01:28:59.310 --> 01:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
wear and I and I hope that the committee
 
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't confuse the two because the
 
01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances under both of them are
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
very very different
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
so as you know as far as far as you're
 
01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the unfunded
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
mandate I I don't I don't know that I
 
01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
view this in that sense where their
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities are already providing the
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
funding to do this they're just saying
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
hey buy X versus y we're we're not going
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
to give you more money we're not
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
changing our clothing allowance policies
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're just saying we're this is what
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to and we expect as
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
you receive your clothing allowance that
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
you will comply with with this
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
change black you have a followup yeah
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you I mean do you see I understand
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
that uh but do you see the issue that on
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
line 18 on page two it requires two
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
things to occur on the same day one is
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
they can't provide as an option you know
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
the uh I guess to purchase although it
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't say this the clothing that
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the p in it um but also um
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to wear it so it's
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
like the option to buy the non-past
 
01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
stuff is provided on the same day you're
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
not allowed to wear the other stuff sure
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
so I I I don't oppose any of this it
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
just seems like that's a problem that
 
01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed in the bill I sure I
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
think I should mention here that this
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
bill is going to go to subcommittee to
 
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
correct the one change and look at this
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
other section to make sure that it's not
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have unintended consequences
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay that was my I get I get what you're
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
saying with the with the with that not
 
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
having much of a difference I I can also
 
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that um you know for for this
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill to go through the process and be
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
successful you you will have um fire
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
departments immediately start the
 
01:30:49.229 --> 01:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
process of of how we're going to how
 
01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're going to be addressing
 
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
this it's they're not going to wait till
 
01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
January of 2025 to go oh wait now we
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
have to thank I mean the bill says what
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
it says sure but thanks yes but I think
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
we with at least two sections where we
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
need some word smithing it it needs to
 
01:31:07.109 --> 01:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
go to subcommittee to get that
 
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:13.149 align:start position:0%
 
subcommittee

01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
G thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you kind of
 
01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
clarified the distinction between
 
01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters and paid
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
firefighter Department um I just to
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
further that to clarify that um so the
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighter
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
answering the call when they're driving
 
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
someplace they'll go straight to the
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
location but are they required to go to
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
the station to get the station gear or
 
01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's not a uniform that's not uniform
 
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
so so some volunteer firefighters carry
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
their Gear with them in their vehicle
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
and respond directly to the scene some
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
report to the fire
 
01:32:03.629 --> 01:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
station to acquire gear and get on
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
apparatus that that is there is no
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
uniformity in the state with that it
 
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
varies from town to town I will tell you
 
01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
that um one of the things
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
that I was always cognizant of as a
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighter is polyester so
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
polyester is bad news in this business
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
bad bad news so because when it melts to
 
01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
your flesh they have to cut it off of
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
you and that because of that I kept um a
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
couple of things in the trunk of my car
 
01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
in the event I'm not a big fan of Po
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
polyester despite what I'm wearing right
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
now but um but that's something that you
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
know that we have have put into people's
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
minds keep in mind that when things are
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
on fire the fire doesn't care if you get
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
a paycheck or not so you know
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
we the so we look at this from a from a
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
career versus a volunteer
 
01:32:58.510 --> 01:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
standpoint there that line is not as
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
important as some make it out to be as
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
far as you know personal protective
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
equipment and and the requirements of
 
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
the profession for for the life of gear
 
01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
the profession for for the life of gear
and

01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
whatnot followup thank you so from the
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
protection of the firefighter be it paid
 
01:33:19.199 --> 01:33:20.149 align:start position:0%
protection of the firefighter be it paid
or

01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:33:23.550 --> 01:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
Volunteer Fire Fighter the gear should
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
be a protective gear the PPE that they
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
are expected to wear in terms of
 
01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
fighting the fire that should be a
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
uniform protective gear correct so the
 
01:33:36.990 --> 01:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
requirements in the conditions to which
 
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
gear is is manufacturers is governed by
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
the National Fire Protection Association
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
which is headquartered in quinsey Mass
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
they have been
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
the the regulating body of that for 135
 
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
years now so uh there is there is no
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
differentiation in their Universe
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
between whether you get a paycheck to
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
fight fire or not that that's irrel you
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't Globe manufacturing which is one
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the largest producers of gear in the
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
United States is in Pittsfield New
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when you place an order with
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
globe they don't ask you if are you
 
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
getting a volunteer set or a career set
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
you you're getting gear so I I don't
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
let's let's not get overly hung up on on
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
the distinction of of that because there
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
the the distinction really only applies
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
in the case of whether or not you're
 
01:34:25.629 --> 01:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
wearing a a duty uniform during the day
 
01:34:25.639 --> 01:34:28.390 align:start position:0%
wearing a a duty uniform during the day
or

01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
not representive G thank you madam chair
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you for hearing my comment
 
01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
it's really a comment not a question but
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh you really helped please no comments
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
in the guys of a question just a
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
question I just want to say that uh to
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
all right I'll ask you this to me it
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
seems that we're talking about the exact
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
same thing we went through for children
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
with fire retardant chemicals on their
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
pajamas that was outlawed years ago
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
would you agree it's sort of the same
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
not at all okay well thank you not at
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
all because because an infant is not
 
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
losing 2 and a half gallons of of water
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
out of their body sitting in a crib I
 
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
hope unless they're next to the furnace
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
um you know and that that's the real big
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
thing here is of course the biological
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
effect of sweating and absorbing and
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
what heat does to certain types of
 
01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
materials that that's the situation here
 
01:35:17.119 --> 01:35:18.629 align:start position:0%
materials that that's the situation here
um

01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
it's not I wouldn't I wouldn't tie those
 
01:35:21.199 --> 01:35:22.270 align:start position:0%
it's not I wouldn't I wouldn't tie those
two

01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
together thank you for um for clarifying
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's even worse point my point was we
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
protected babies years ago we owe our
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%

started out
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
quick changing or adding a

01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
um let me give you a little history on
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
critical incident stress management we
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
I've been doing it for pretty close to
 
01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
40 years um and for the longest time I
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
was the only team in New Hampshire but
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
now we're up to around seven some are
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
police some are
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
combination um I'm uh my team the grite
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
state critical incident stress
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
management team uh provide services to
 
01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
please Fire
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
EMS um pretty much any emergency
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
responder and we are now reaching out to
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
include Hospital emergency room staff
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
right because we pick up a bunch of crap
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
on the on the street and we walk into
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and drump that crap
 
01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:09.159 align:start position:0%
on their stretcher so uh they run into
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
the same chaos the same uh stress
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
responses that we do uh and for the
 
01:38:20.669 --> 01:38:20.679 align:start position:0%
longest time they had nobody to get this
 
01:38:20.679 --> 01:38:22.390 align:start position:0%
longest time they had nobody to get this
service

01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
from so once I put in this bill I heard
 
01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:29.629 align:start position:0%
from so once I put in this bill I heard
from

01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
uh the police department uh Southern New
 
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police team but they're also
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
doing police fire and EMS now that they
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
thought while we're opening this
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
up to and what this really is doing for
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
us is giving us the same protection
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
that mental health uh providers have
 
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
with their clients right it's
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
confidential um canip Peno all those
 
01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
things so to do that we have to have
 
01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
them listed in
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
here so we've opened up the the
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
definition we're going to use the um
 
01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
homeland security definition of First
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
Responders and we're also going to add
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
that hospital emergency room staff which
 
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:24.109 align:start position:0%
that hospital emergency room staff which
is

01:39:24.109 --> 01:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
on I believe it's I on the second page
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:36.149 --> 01:39:36.159 align:start position:0%
page to protect the confidentiality when
 
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
we're working with the hospital
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
staff we also added
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
retirees into the
 
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
mix because they are an important
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
part uh one for being able to deliver
 
01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
the service but also receiving that
 
01:39:56.189 --> 01:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
service right
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
um we look at retirees that when they
 
01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
retire they walk away from the support
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
system that they had right when they
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
working they can talk to their fellow
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
fire police or whoever about what's
 
01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:15.639 align:start position:0%
going on with them right because we
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
share the same
 
01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
experiences but when we walk away from
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
our job we walk away from that support
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
system and we find that our suicide rate
 
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:30.830 align:start position:0%
system and we find that our suicide rate
in

01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
retirees is rapidly climbing because
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're not getting these Services they
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
don't feel they have access to them and
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure they know that
 
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
they're covered and we are working very
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
hard to reach out to them as we
 
01:40:50.709 --> 01:40:50.719 align:start position:0%
speak to prevent that right not only are
 
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
our retirees suicide rates climbing
 
01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
but all the First
 
01:40:59.709 --> 01:40:59.719 align:start position:0%
Responders are and I like I don't like
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
to say it but my statement is that we're
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
kind of in a race with the
 
01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
military to see who can be on the top of
 
01:41:09.149 --> 01:41:09.159 align:start position:0%
that pile that nobody wants to be
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
on so we need to make sure that we can
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
provide these
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
services and that the people who are
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
providing the services feel confident
 
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
that what they say will be protected
 
01:41:24.750 --> 01:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise they won't come they will not
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
come right especially the police right
 
01:41:30.189 --> 01:41:30.199 align:start position:0%
because some of the things that they
 
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
deal with are
 
01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
are pretty significant right not that
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else is less but they get more
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
scrutiny from their supervisors well
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
what did you say in there right and and
 
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
and has happened in the past that
 
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
supervisors had sat them down and said
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
we want to know what you said in there
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
or what was said in there and and I know
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
of one police officer that went to jail
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
and contempt the court because he would
 
01:41:59.709 --> 01:41:59.719 align:start position:0%
not tell them what was said before we
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
protection so I don't want to see that
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
happening because we missed somebody in
 
01:42:10.510 --> 01:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
the definitions here so that's why
 
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more um added and you'll
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
notice that a lot of it is just
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
repeating the new definition in certain
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
spots and again like you said we added
 
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
the hospital one that's a completely new
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
one that we we really wanted to make
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
sure we're making sure that the 911
 
01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
operators are included because they
 
01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
weren't they are not technically
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
dispatchers we had dispatchers they are
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
tele communicators right they answer the
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
phones but they listen to some horrible
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
things on the phone right and and the
 
01:42:47.229 --> 01:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
imagination is a terrible terrible thing
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and I can tell you from experience
 
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.910 align:start position:0%
and and I can tell you from experience
so

01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
I ask that um we get this moved through
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure our Our First Responders
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
are taken care of and I have some other
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
people that will also testify but with
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
that I'll close my testimony and take
 
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
them thank you are there any questions
 
01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:13.239 align:start position:0%

Hampshire um Hospital Association that
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
will be speaking I believe they are
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
behind me and that's where this
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
definition came from okay we had if
 
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
there is anyone here who plans to
 
01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:29.000 align:start position:0%

01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
know M sorry I forgot to drop it on my
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
way by yes but if there's someone from

the hospital Association or whatever I
 
01:43:37.589 --> 01:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
don't have any other cards on this bill
 
01:43:39.390 --> 01:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
so please turn them in now I guess it's
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
just me then so that definition came
 
01:43:45.310 --> 01:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
from the hospital Association we had
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
another one previously uh and we had a
 
01:43:52.990 --> 01:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
meeting with them and they uh didn't
 
01:43:54.990 --> 01:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
really like it and gave us the better
 
01:43:57.589 --> 01:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
definition that's why it that's what's
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
in here
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
now thank you okay any other questions
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
for representative Schmidt thank you
 
01:44:10.589 --> 01:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
madam chair so that it's just
 
01:44:14.830 --> 01:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
a so th this is not a new bill right no
 
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
this is it says it's an amendment so you
 
01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
already brought us the original 1079
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
y so it's already in statute it's been
 
01:44:28.350 --> 01:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
in statute for a long time so we are
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
just doing some housekeeping on that
 
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
making sure that all the people like
 
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
retirees got covered the
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
telecommunicators got covered and the
 
01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
only thing we're really adding is the
 
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency room staff or
 
01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
emergency department staff I I I get
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
that but the thing is that this is not
 
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
in the usual form it's the unusual form
 
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
of a of the of an amendment yeah the
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
earlier oh great so that was never mind
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
so that was my original Amendment just
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
to add the hospital staff and then they
 
01:45:10.109 --> 01:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
I heard from other people who said hey
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
while we have this going in maybe we
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
should add these things that we've been
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
thinking about adding for a while but
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
didn't really want to open it up
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
others represent bti thank you madam
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you representative for
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question how does this differ
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
from Employee Assistance or employee
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
mental Wellness uh so approach this
 
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
differs as we are
 
01:45:47.709 --> 01:45:47.719 align:start position:0%
peer driven right
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
so as far as I'm concerned the person in
 
01:45:55.149 --> 01:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
in in the employees assistance program
 
01:45:59.790 --> 01:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
has no idea what my job is
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
none right so when I tell them
 
01:46:05.589 --> 01:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
my what's going on with me they're going
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
what we have mental health people on our
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
teams we make them ride in police cars
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
fire trucks ambulances and hang out with
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
us right
 
01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
so we don't just go to any mental health
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
provider because frankly unless they've
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
been trained and know who we are we
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
scare the crap out of them quote unquote
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
that I've been told from mental health
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
professionals you know I've heard
 
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
stories where someone would be in the
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
middle of their story telling them what
 
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
what was going on the mental health
 
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
person would cry and walk out of the
 
01:46:47.709 --> 01:46:47.719 align:start position:0%
room so that's why this is different
 
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's why this works for us is is that
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
we're relating to people who know have
 
01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:55.719 align:start position:0%
walked a mile in my
 
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
shoes so they know what's what I'm
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
talking about and and can help me get
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
through it because they've probably been
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
through it
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
already thank
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
you I noticed that you have a much
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
better definition of what's confidential
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
than in current statute so thank you for
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
that that was one of our goals all right
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:32.840 align:start position:0%

01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
team excuse me and and the New Hampshire
 
01:47:53.589 --> 01:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
Police Association I wanted to thank the
 
01:47:54.669 --> 01:47:54.679 align:start position:0%
committee this morning first and
 
01:47:56.669 --> 01:47:56.679 align:start position:0%
foremost for your attention to this very
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
important update to our existing
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
Privileges and protections to this
 
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
statute um just a little bit of History
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
this was established back in
 
01:48:08.189 --> 01:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
2012 um so we have been very fortunate
 
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
to have this protection for our
 
01:48:12.189 --> 01:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
employees since
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
2012 um this has absolutely helped us
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
save lives of countless First Responders
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm sorry that is my
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
comfort dog partner so he does therapy
 
01:48:26.109 --> 01:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
work in in crisis response only so he's
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to come might come check on
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
everybody this morning um as I was
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
saying this is a very important piece of
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that's helped us save
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
countless lives at this point of New
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's First Responders and we're
 
01:48:39.589 --> 01:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
extremely lucky to have this Statute in
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
place um some of the edits that Mr PR
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
was discussing are like he said and I'll
 
01:48:48.589 --> 01:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
use his term a lot of it is housekeeping
 
01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
um some of the the terminology
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing us look to correct
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
with this edit um is to reflect some of
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
the work that we've been doing on the
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
pts committee um and defining things and
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
making sure that our New Hampshire First
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
Responders are protected and taken care
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
of after they respond to critical
 
01:49:07.390 --> 01:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
incidents um so that's why you see some
 
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
of the terminology changes that you do
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
um as we talked about and I'd like to
 
01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
address the representative's question in
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
regards to the difference of peer
 
01:49:18.589 --> 01:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
support and EAP I think that that's a
 
01:49:20.910 --> 01:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
very good question um because there are
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
many departments across the state in all
 
01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
of the first responder community that do
 
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
have EAP programs stood up in place for
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
their employees what this members some
 
01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
of members of this committee have heard
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
us testify to in the past is that there
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
are still some unfortunate barriers for
 
01:49:38.510 --> 01:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
first responder Personnel to access EAP
 
01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
programs I'm not sure if anybody in here
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
has ever picked up the phone and had to
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
make that call to an EAP um but I can
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
assure you that it's a less than
 
01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
personable experience um most of the
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
time the the voice on the other end of
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
the line isn't even from this part of
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
the country um they don't know the
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
department that you're calling from um
 
01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
and they have very limited ability to
 
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
connect with the First Responders that
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
are reaching out to access and and ask
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
for help um oftentimes you're left
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
waiting on the on the line for minutes
 
01:50:13.629 --> 01:50:13.639 align:start position:0%
at a time hoping that the right person
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
answers the phone to get you connected
 
01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
to the services that you need um and
 
01:50:19.589 --> 01:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
quite frankly if you're in a crisis
 
01:50:21.229 --> 01:50:21.239 align:start position:0%
situation and you're reaching out and
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
have to sit on hold listening to music
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
and or a narrated prompt most First
 
01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
Responders are going to hang up the
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
phone um and so what the peer support
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
teams are doing across the state is we
 
01:50:35.070 --> 01:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
are genuinely the bridge that Bridges
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
the gap between culturally competent
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
Community licensed Community Mental
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
Health Providers and our peers and I
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
think it's essential that we continue to
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do this or we will
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
continue to lose First Responders to
 
01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
suicide in the State uh I think I I
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative Maguire
 
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
bringing up the fact that a big portion
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
of our modifications to this statute are
 
01:51:00.350 --> 01:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
really trying to clarify for everybody
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
the limitations to this to this level of
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
confidentiality because it is important
 
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
for that to be laid out very clearly for
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
everybody um that starts on line 22 on
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
the second page and I think that you
 
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
know we were these teams were with the
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
exception of Mr PR and I say this with
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
all due due respect in 2012 when we
 
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
wrote this we were all pretty young and
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
we were new at this game representative
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
PR had a lot of experience at that time
 
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
and he's taken a lot of leadership along
 
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
the way and and mentored many of us as
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
we've worked through and had a better
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
understanding of how to do this work
 
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
well um and so what we've heard from
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
very many agencies across the state is
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
we they would like us to clarify for
 
01:51:41.069 --> 01:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
everybody the limitations of that
 
01:51:43.149 --> 01:51:43.159 align:start position:0%
confidentiality I think that I hope that
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
when you read those edits you'll see
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
that we are this is truly a support
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
service that's meant to protect not only
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
our officers but the community
 
01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
um you know we this was initially um
 
01:51:54.589 --> 01:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
something that was very important to
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
have in there so that way everybody
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
believed in the system and how it worked
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
um and knew that when the when the need
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
arose we were going to act and continue
 
01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
to get people help prevent crimes and
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that people were connected to
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
the appropriate services so we greatly
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and the ability to
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
clarify a couple of those points for the
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
committee this morning thank you are
 
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
there any questions repres man
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
py thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:52:22.510 --> 01:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question so since 2012 this
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
was established you said the peer
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
support um is there any data or
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
statistics to show the decline in
 
01:52:35.629 --> 01:52:35.639 align:start position:0%
suicide or adverse effect for First
 
01:52:38.430 --> 01:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
Responders I wish there was a a very
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
good data set I think what we have to
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
acknowledge not only as uh a profession
 
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
um but also as a committee is that these
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
these losses are unfortunately very
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
underreported not only in New Hampshire
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
but also across the state um we're
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
actually doing some work on our pts
 
01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
committee um Senator Burell just
 
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
presented that to hopefully reinstate us
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
for for another session um and our hopes
 
01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
for this this legislative session is to
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
really focus on that we've been having
 
01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
some very productive conversations on
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
how we are going to collect that data so
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
we can have a true understanding of the
 
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
scope of the problem here in New
 
01:53:17.189 --> 01:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and also be able to come
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
forward and show that we are having a
 
01:53:20.589 --> 01:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
positive impact with these types of
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
Employee Services programs um but
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there isn't a mechanism in
 
01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
place to at accurately collect that data
 
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
at this time okay um I can say that
 
01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
there is a nonprofit that's recognized
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
nationally that does collect this data
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
um and the and the numbers are they are
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
all relied on self-reporting um the
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
numbers for last year were 118 law
 
01:53:48.270 --> 01:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement suicides across the country
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
and at at least 2 five in the fire
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
department Community um also impacted by
 
01:53:56.109 --> 01:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
this and and reflected in the statute
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
are Corrections Personnel um Emergency
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
Services dispatchers um and they are
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
also impacted by the cultural barriers
 
01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
to accessing culturally competent
 
01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:08.599 align:start position:0%

standing reports from our members that
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%

03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
over here but um for the record I'm
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative Tony
 
03:02:11.269 --> 03:02:11.279 align:start position:0%

of Hudson and Lichfield
 
03:02:14.479 --> 03:02:15.870 align:start position:0%

and

03:02:15.870 --> 03:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:18.190 --> 03:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
03:02:21.070 --> 03:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
is related to
 
03:02:23.830 --> 03:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with the state of emergency I
 
03:02:25.830 --> 03:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
mean there were I know there were
 
03:02:29.750 --> 03:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
various concerns um raised about the
 
03:02:29.760 --> 03:02:31.469 align:start position:0%
various concerns um raised about the
recent

03:02:31.469 --> 03:02:31.479 align:start position:0%
recent
 
03:02:33.990 --> 03:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
um state of emergency and different
 
03:02:38.269 --> 03:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
views on it but um the idea here is to
 
03:02:42.150 --> 03:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh to make it
 
03:02:44.950 --> 03:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
clear that no branch of the uh
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
government should be involved in
 
03:02:50.349 --> 03:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
suspending civil liberties or of either
 
03:02:52.269 --> 03:02:52.279 align:start position:0%
the us or the New Hampshire
 
03:02:54.510 --> 03:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution now you'd think that would
 
03:02:57.229 --> 03:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
be obvious but there were some things
 
03:03:00.790 --> 03:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
that went on that uh you know could
 
03:03:02.910 --> 03:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
certainly been viewed that
 
03:03:05.110 --> 03:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
way uh the ones that I remember in
 
03:03:07.710 --> 03:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
particular were related
 
03:03:11.110 --> 03:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
to limiting what could be done in uh
 
03:03:14.150 --> 03:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
places of worship churches synagogues
 
03:03:16.030 --> 03:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing putting restrictions
 
03:03:18.389 --> 03:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
on them that was quite a bit more
 
03:03:20.750 --> 03:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
significant even that on uh a lot of
 
03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:22.190 align:start position:0%
significant even that on uh a lot of
commercial

03:03:22.190 --> 03:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
03:03:24.389 --> 03:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
establishments big box stores grocery
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
stores and things like that so you
 
03:03:28.750 --> 03:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
there's some evidence that there was a
 
03:03:31.150 --> 03:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
an actual problem and this is uh in
 
03:03:32.469 --> 03:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
response to
 
03:03:34.910 --> 03:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm not the prime sponsor on this
 
03:03:36.990 --> 03:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
but I certainly uh support
 
03:03:41.070 --> 03:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
it that's all I have thank you are there
 
03:03:44.590 --> 03:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:03:44.600 --> 03:03:46.630 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
represent

03:03:46.630 --> 03:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:03:49.349 --> 03:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
gr I guess I want some clarification
 
03:03:51.429 --> 03:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
because in the bill it says no state
 
03:03:55.229 --> 03:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
employee department or agency but you
 
03:03:58.349 --> 03:03:58.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned churches and grocery stores so
 
03:04:00.990 --> 03:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
I'm where's the am I misunderstanding
 
03:04:02.910 --> 03:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
what you said can you speak closer to
 
03:04:04.670 --> 03:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
the microphone oh sure
 
03:04:06.990 --> 03:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
sorry uh it's a little hard to tell how
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
loud or not I am from here um the issue
 
03:04:12.750 --> 03:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
was enforcement that was taken against
 
03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
the churches and all of that by the
 
03:04:17.349 --> 03:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
state government in particular requiring
 
03:04:19.229 --> 03:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
them to close or putting
 
03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
limitations on what they could do around
 
03:04:24.790 --> 03:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
um having people attend during the uh Co
 
03:04:27.389 --> 03:04:27.399 align:start position:0%
state of emergency that's the
 
03:04:27.399 --> 03:04:34.790 align:start position:0%
state of emergency that's the
relationship

03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:38.030 --> 03:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
connection other questions represent
 
03:04:40.670 --> 03:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
Andy thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
03:04:47.790 --> 03:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
um Co Public Health was one emergency
 
03:04:50.990 --> 03:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned are the other example
 
03:04:54.870 --> 03:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
of emergency situation would it include
 
03:05:00.990 --> 03:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
floods and um natural disaster situation
 
03:05:03.670 --> 03:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
where the state put an
 
03:05:06.429 --> 03:05:06.439 align:start position:0%
emergency well um yeah the typical
 
03:05:08.910 --> 03:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
emergencies are due to natural disasters
 
03:05:11.110 --> 03:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
floods ice storms and that sort of
 
03:05:13.710 --> 03:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
thing I mean I could imagine come up
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
with scenarios where um it could be an
 
03:05:19.750 --> 03:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
issue there but I have I don't
 
03:05:22.670 --> 03:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
recall um any situation where there's
 
03:05:24.150 --> 03:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
been a state of emergency that's the
 
03:05:26.590 --> 03:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
kind of normal weather related one where
 
03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
this has been raised at an issue so and
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get into doing some
 
03:05:33.429 --> 03:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
far-fetched hypothetical but in the
 
03:05:34.950 --> 03:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
normal course of dealing with those
 
03:05:37.910 --> 03:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
emergencies I don't know of any uh
 
03:05:39.870 --> 03:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
problem like that that's come up it's
 
03:05:43.389 --> 03:05:43.399 align:start position:0%
it's more the you know some wider larger
 
03:05:45.150 --> 03:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
thing that's
 
03:05:48.030 --> 03:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
um um you know a different sort of an
 
03:05:51.670 --> 03:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
emergency and you know I hope we never
 
03:05:53.950 --> 03:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
have another emergency other than the
 
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
normal dealing with natural disasters um
 
03:05:59.870 --> 03:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
but given the experience we'd like to
 
03:06:01.389 --> 03:06:01.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's not something
 
03:06:05.070 --> 03:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:08.190 --> 03:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
future okay represent black I have a
 
03:06:14.670 --> 03:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
question RSA 445 Roman 3A says that not
 
03:06:17.110 --> 03:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
withstanding the above civil liberty
 
03:06:19.590 --> 03:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
shall on no account be suspended nor
 
03:06:22.429 --> 03:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
shall the United States Constitution or
 
03:06:24.150 --> 03:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution be
 
03:06:27.990 --> 03:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
suspended so why are you saying this is
 
03:06:31.070 --> 03:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
to tell the tell every organization to
 
03:06:34.030 --> 03:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
follow the law um I don't have that RSA
 
03:06:35.590 --> 03:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
in front of me and I didn't draft this
 
03:06:38.990 --> 03:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill um you know I can take a look at it
 
03:06:42.229 --> 03:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
and and provide an answer to that but um
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know if if if
 
03:06:47.309 --> 03:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
the if the language is in the statute
 
03:06:49.389 --> 03:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
now except enumerating the parts of the
 
03:06:51.950 --> 03:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
executive branch then then that might be
 
03:06:51.960 --> 03:06:53.550 align:start position:0%
executive branch then then that might be
the

03:06:53.550 --> 03:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:56.670 --> 03:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
case ah thank you that's a point
 
03:06:56.680 --> 03:06:58.150 align:start position:0%
case ah thank you that's a point
representative

03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:07:01.910 --> 03:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:05.590 --> 03:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
chair so uh thank you representative
 
03:07:08.469 --> 03:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
leus for bringing this bill um and tell
 
03:07:12.590 --> 03:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
me given the fact that the the suggested
 
03:07:12.600 --> 03:07:13.990 align:start position:0%
me given the fact that the the suggested
addition

03:07:13.990 --> 03:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
addition
 
03:07:21.150 --> 03:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
uh to um the U statute um was not yet in
 
03:07:24.229 --> 03:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
effect uh can you give us some examples
 
03:07:26.910 --> 03:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
of um
 
03:07:30.070 --> 03:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
occurrences that would have in your view
 
03:07:32.229 --> 03:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh violated this provision had it been
 
03:07:36.910 --> 03:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
in effect um well first of all as as was
 
03:07:38.710 --> 03:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
asked by uh the
 
03:07:42.670 --> 03:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
chair um you know this may already be
 
03:07:44.469 --> 03:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
something which Al although in other
 
03:07:48.229 --> 03:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
words is already um illegal um if that's
 
03:07:50.910 --> 03:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
the case then in my view um that part of
 
03:07:52.469 --> 03:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
the statute was
 
03:07:55.349 --> 03:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
violated uh during the co co emergency
 
03:07:57.070 --> 03:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
may you know there may be a number of
 
03:08:00.190 --> 03:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
things but in particular as uh religious
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh institutions were dealt with as
 
03:08:04.710 --> 03:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
religious institutions were dealt with
 
03:08:07.070 --> 03:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
because they were required to close or
 
03:08:09.630 --> 03:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
had much more serious limits on them
 
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
than other organizations like grocery
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
stores or you know big box stores or any
 
03:08:18.309 --> 03:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
of that which um so there was they were
 
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
singled out
 
03:08:22.630 --> 03:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
arguably um or at least there wasn't the
 
03:08:24.269 --> 03:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
uh they weren't seen as important and so
 
03:08:25.950 --> 03:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
there weren't concessions or or
 
03:08:27.510 --> 03:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
accommodations made that were made for
 
03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
things like grocery stores and other
 
03:08:32.110 --> 03:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
types of things and that's the concern
 
03:08:36.070 --> 03:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
and so if this were in place there at
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
that time then yes what was done would
 
03:08:40.030 --> 03:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
have violated this now as the chair
 
03:08:41.710 --> 03:08:41.720 align:start position:0%
asked it might be that it's already
 
03:08:43.469 --> 03:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
illegal in which case St statute was
 
03:08:44.710 --> 03:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
violated by
 
03:08:47.790 --> 03:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
that statute that was I apologize if my
 
03:08:50.590 --> 03:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
question was repetitive but given the
 
03:08:52.150 --> 03:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
fact that you were speaking so much
 
03:08:55.309 --> 03:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
softly I apologize in a large room yeah
 
03:08:57.150 --> 03:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
I wasn't quite sure I was picking up
 
03:08:59.429 --> 03:08:59.439 align:start position:0%
your meaning and I don't ever want that
 
03:09:00.830 --> 03:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
I understand one of the problems here
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
sitting here is it's hard to tell how
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
quiet or loud I'm coming through the mic
 
03:09:06.630 --> 03:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
I'll wave at you in the next
 
03:09:11.309 --> 03:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
time okay thank you any other questions
 
03:09:13.990 --> 03:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none all right thank you thank
 
03:09:16.429 --> 03:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony is there anyone

03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%

good good afternoon welcome back to Edna
 
03:46:37.229 --> 03:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
I'm opening the hearing on House Bill

1267 and I call the prime sponsor
 
03:46:39.840 --> 03:46:42.349 align:start position:0%
1267 and I call the prime sponsor
representative

03:46:42.349 --> 03:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:46:44.710 --> 03:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
elure thank you madam chair members of
 
03:46:44.720 --> 03:46:46.070 align:start position:0%
elure thank you madam chair members of
the

03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:46:49.590 --> 03:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
committee I have uh just provided a
 
03:46:54.189 --> 03:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
handout which is executive order
 
03:46:56.830 --> 03:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
23-3 signed by the governor on April
 
03:47:00.429 --> 03:47:00.439 align:start position:0%
10th of last year I would ask that you
 
03:47:03.110 --> 03:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
note that the language of my bill is
 
03:47:06.750 --> 03:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
submitted was taken verbatim from this
 
03:47:09.870 --> 03:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
executive order with only minor
 
03:47:14.189 --> 03:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
made the term
 
03:47:20.149 --> 03:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
ESG is an industry standard term and as
 
03:47:24.070 --> 03:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
industry I would note that the executive
 
03:47:31.590 --> 03:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
order as signed last year only prohibits
 
03:47:35.389 --> 03:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
investing in ESG funds if ESG is the
 
03:47:41.110 --> 03:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
sole reason for that investment now the
 
03:47:45.149 --> 03:47:45.159 align:start position:0%
reality is that no funds are invested
 
03:47:49.229 --> 03:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
solely based on ESG technically I don't
 
03:47:50.830 --> 03:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
believe that would even be an investment
 
03:47:53.870 --> 03:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
it it would be something else um and
 
03:47:57.269 --> 03:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
somehow if somebody managed to do so it
 
03:47:58.910 --> 03:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
it would be virtually impossible to
 
03:48:02.070 --> 03:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
prove that as such the executive order
 
03:48:05.830 --> 03:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
is written and currently existing in uh
 
03:48:10.590 --> 03:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
in rules is entirely unenforceable
 
03:48:13.269 --> 03:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
and makes no meaningful progress against
 
03:48:16.189 --> 03:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
fighting the ESG
 
03:48:21.149 --> 03:48:21.159 align:start position:0%
cartel now why do I call it the ESG
 
03:48:24.870 --> 03:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
cartel ESG exists as a public private
 
03:48:27.790 --> 03:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
partnership that utilizes carrot stick
 
03:48:30.349 --> 03:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
methods such as those employed by the
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Campaign where they are
 
03:48:35.870 --> 03:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
tasked with scoring organizations based
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
on political and social activist
 
03:48:38.399 --> 03:48:40.189 align:start position:0%
on political and social activist
criteria

03:48:40.189 --> 03:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
03:48:42.070 --> 03:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
these scores are then
 
03:48:44.910 --> 03:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
weaponized by a combination of public
 
03:48:48.429 --> 03:48:48.439 align:start position:0%
and private sector actors to limit
 
03:48:50.750 --> 03:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
access to capital for those who do not
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
score high enough and to reward those
 
03:48:57.429 --> 03:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
who do by directing mostly other
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
people's retirement funds to these
 
03:49:05.110 --> 03:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
organizations this process in
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
theory could be said to make ESG
 
03:49:11.630 --> 03:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
profitable but the reality is that it is
 
03:49:14.790 --> 03:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
a monopolistic cartel manipulating the
 
03:49:18.030 --> 03:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
free market and the only profits that
 
03:49:20.149 --> 03:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
come are the ones that come through the
 
03:49:23.630 --> 03:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
weaponization of this carrot stick
 
03:49:23.640 --> 03:49:25.149 align:start position:0%
weaponization of this carrot stick
model

03:49:25.149 --> 03:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
model
 
03:49:28.710 --> 03:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
also in this manner you will see why I
 
03:49:32.750 --> 03:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
did not choose to Simply word my bill to
 
03:49:35.630 --> 03:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
prohibit anything any kind of investing
 
03:49:37.710 --> 03:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
except that of those solely directed
 
03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
toward maximizing gains
 
03:49:42.110 --> 03:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
because of this cartel mechanism that is
 
03:49:45.110 --> 03:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
in place a fund manager could credibly
 
03:49:47.870 --> 03:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
make the argument that by cooperating
 
03:49:49.870 --> 03:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
with the cartel activity they are
 
03:49:52.590 --> 03:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
seeking to maximize gains because they
 
03:49:57.389 --> 03:49:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:00.510 --> 03:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
stick in this manner the ESG cartel
 
03:50:03.269 --> 03:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
represents the financial engine of the
 
03:50:03.279 --> 03:50:05.309 align:start position:0%
represents the financial engine of the
cultural

03:50:05.309 --> 03:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
revolution the New Hampshire
 
03:50:09.750 --> 03:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution under the SE
 
03:50:14.149 --> 03:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
on inculcating values outlines strictly
 
03:50:16.590 --> 03:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
that we as a body shall take all
 
03:50:20.910 --> 03:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
necessary measures to disrupt and Crush
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive monopolistic and cartel
 
03:50:26.950 --> 03:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
marketplace this prohibition on ESG
 
03:50:31.750 --> 03:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
investing is easily distinguished from
 
03:50:31.760 --> 03:50:33.870 align:start position:0%
investing is easily distinguished from
non-g

03:50:33.870 --> 03:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
non-g
 
03:50:36.790 --> 03:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
investing simply put those Investments
 
03:50:38.910 --> 03:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
seeking to maximize gains without regard
 
03:50:41.429 --> 03:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
to the cartel activity and doing so in
 
03:50:43.269 --> 03:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
keeping with governmental regulatory
 
03:50:46.750 --> 03:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
Frameworks do not represent ESG
 
03:50:49.149 --> 03:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
investing only those Investments wherein
 
03:50:51.110 --> 03:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
gains are knowingly
 
03:50:54.750 --> 03:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
forone toward activism or wherein the
 
03:50:57.309 --> 03:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
only argument for maximizing gains is
 
03:50:59.429 --> 03:50:59.439 align:start position:0%
dependent on an expectation of the
 
03:51:01.670 --> 03:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
continuation of cartel activity to
 
03:51:03.149 --> 03:51:03.159 align:start position:0%
realize those
 
03:51:06.750 --> 03:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
gains that is ESG
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
investing so why criminal penalty to
 
03:51:14.670 --> 03:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
this when you seek to utilize These
 
03:51:17.309 --> 03:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
funds for which there is an expectation
 
03:51:18.910 --> 03:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
on the part of the investor that their
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
gains will be
 
03:51:24.189 --> 03:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
maximized to cooperate with the cartel
 
03:51:26.790 --> 03:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
and to prioritize social and political
 
03:51:28.710 --> 03:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
activism you
 
03:51:31.790 --> 03:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily are purposely foregoing some
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
unknowable amount of gains to accomplish
 
03:51:34.439 --> 03:51:36.630 align:start position:0%
unknowable amount of gains to accomplish
this

03:51:36.630 --> 03:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:51:40.510 --> 03:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
purpose this is tantamount Broad
 
03:51:42.429 --> 03:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
and the funds we are discussing today
 
03:51:44.110 --> 03:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
represent such a substantial chunk of
 
03:51:46.630 --> 03:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
money that that degree of theft or fraud
 
03:51:49.229 --> 03:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
would easily clear the necessary amounts
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
to be a felony
 
03:51:54.110 --> 03:51:54.120 align:start position:0%
offense this is not their money to wield
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
as a weapon against their
 
03:51:58.269 --> 03:51:58.279 align:start position:0%
opposition this money belongs to the
 
03:52:00.070 --> 03:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
people who are expecting a
 
03:52:02.189 --> 03:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
retirement and this is a common sense
 
03:52:05.710 --> 03:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
measure to protect that retirement I'd
 
03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions thank
 
03:52:13.070 --> 03:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
you us thank you um so this question is
 
03:52:17.110 --> 03:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
is related to um why you believe this is
 
03:52:20.229 --> 03:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
necessary I mean in statute today the
 
03:52:22.710 --> 03:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
retirement system can only do
 
03:52:24.830 --> 03:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
Investments you know related to their
 
03:52:27.790 --> 03:52:27.800 align:start position:0%
fidu responsibility in other words you
 
03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
know the best long-term the best in
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
return over whatever the appropriate
 
03:52:35.389 --> 03:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
time scale is consistent with acceptable
 
03:52:38.189 --> 03:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
risk and um I don't remember what it did
 
03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the Senate we had a bill to require
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
the treasure to do the same thing for
 
03:52:44.750 --> 03:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
other funds so given that and given that
 
03:52:47.710 --> 03:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
um you know what you said about they're
 
03:52:50.149 --> 03:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
going to forego gains to accomplish some
 
03:52:54.189 --> 03:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
social activity it would seem that
 
03:52:57.510 --> 03:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
um you know that right now there is a
 
03:52:59.910 --> 03:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
Prohibition unless against investing
 
03:53:01.269 --> 03:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
these things unless
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
somehow um you know it's it's reasonable
 
03:53:06.469 --> 03:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
to believe and experience shows ongoing
 
03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
that it is in fact um the best
 
03:53:11.149 --> 03:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
investment and and and I asked that
 
03:53:13.990 --> 03:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
question even though I basically agree
 
03:53:16.630 --> 03:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
with your general view about ESG but the
 
03:53:18.990 --> 03:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
question is you know do we need to put
 
03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
something specifically about that in
 
03:53:22.550 --> 03:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
statute thank you for the question I
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
would offer uh two Avenues of response
 
03:53:28.830 --> 03:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
first um as I said uh fund managers
 
03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
could reasonably under ESG guidelines
 
03:53:34.030 --> 03:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
make a credible argument that they are
 
03:53:36.309 --> 03:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
seeking to maximize profit because
 
03:53:39.750 --> 03:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
they're looking to benefit from the
 
03:53:41.950 --> 03:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
monopolistic cartel activity that is
 
03:53:43.950 --> 03:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
occurring and they're expecting that to
 
03:53:47.910 --> 03:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
continue into the future um which could
 
03:53:49.830 --> 03:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
produce a source of Revenue uh that
 
03:53:51.229 --> 03:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
could be
 
03:53:53.469 --> 03:53:53.479 align:start position:0%
profitable the second reason I would
 
03:53:56.269 --> 03:53:56.279 align:start position:0%
offer is because the executive branch
 
03:53:57.710 --> 03:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
believed that this was important enough
 
03:53:59.149 --> 03:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
to do something about the unfortunate
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
fact is their order is unenforcable but
 
03:54:02.790 --> 03:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm seeking to
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
fix okay thank
 
03:54:09.110 --> 03:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
you need to follow up um I mean you only
 
03:54:10.830 --> 03:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up would be that I mean did you
 
03:54:13.790 --> 03:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
know realize that the at least for the
 
03:54:16.070 --> 03:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system they're supposed to
 
03:54:18.429 --> 03:54:18.439 align:start position:0%
they're required to actually do their
 
03:54:21.309 --> 03:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
own analysis and not just accept you
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
know whatever is put out there by a fund
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
manager and so they're going to have
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
their own fiduciary responsibility look
 
03:54:28.469 --> 03:54:28.479 align:start position:0%
into this and see if they believe that's
 
03:54:30.990 --> 03:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
actually true um so again it's it just
 
03:54:33.269 --> 03:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
goes into asking whether this is really
 
03:54:35.229 --> 03:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
necessary yes I I would offer when I
 
03:54:36.710 --> 03:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
when I said fund manager I should have
 
03:54:38.590 --> 03:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
been more expansive to say that any
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
person managing such funds could
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
credibly make this argument that because
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
of the expectation of ongoing cartel
 
03:54:46.990 --> 03:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
activity they could actually produce
 
03:54:48.990 --> 03:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
profit through this methodology even
 
03:54:50.349 --> 03:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
though it's clearly against the New
 
03:54:52.590 --> 03:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh provision in our
 
03:54:55.110 --> 03:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
constitution against cartel and and anti
 
03:54:58.110 --> 03:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh anti-free Market behavior all right
 
03:54:58.120 --> 03:54:59.590 align:start position:0%
uh anti-free Market behavior all right
thank

03:54:59.590 --> 03:54:59.600 align:start position:0%

03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%

them an email if that's sufficient
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:39.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:55:39.870 --> 03:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:55:41.590 --> 03:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative corkran co-sponsor of the
 
03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for your
 
03:55:46.429 --> 03:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
time um first of all I'd like to uh just
 
03:55:47.870 --> 03:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
go on record is agreeing with everything
 
03:55:50.309 --> 03:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
that representative Belcher said there
 
03:55:51.830 --> 03:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
are two main arguments that I have
 
03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
against ESG one of them moral one of
 
03:55:54.479 --> 03:55:55.309 align:start position:0%
against ESG one of them moral one of
them

03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:55:59.710 --> 03:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
utilitarian the moral one is obvious
 
03:56:03.149 --> 03:56:03.159 align:start position:0%
that if you are allowing a state
 
03:56:06.030 --> 03:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
employee to invest on something other
 
03:56:09.790 --> 03:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
than compounding retirees funds as
 
03:56:12.189 --> 03:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible you are
 
03:56:14.269 --> 03:56:14.279 align:start position:0%
deprioritizing what all of the employees
 
03:56:15.990 --> 03:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
or excuse me the retirees and current
 
03:56:18.070 --> 03:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
employees are looking forward to and you
 
03:56:21.950 --> 03:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
are prioritizing a uh unelected you know
 
03:56:24.429 --> 03:56:24.439 align:start position:0%
office worker to inject their own morals
 
03:56:26.830 --> 03:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
now maybe those morals align with yours
 
03:56:28.830 --> 03:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
maybe the office worker is a member of
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
the Knights of Columbus and they're
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
going down some sort of Knights of
 
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
Columbus um approved uh groups that
 
03:56:36.910 --> 03:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
invest in you know a certain Catholic uh
 
03:56:38.910 --> 03:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
Le organization in Germany and this
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
other you know mining concern in
 
03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
Argentina and so forth and so on in
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
which case you're like okay uh this
 
03:56:46.149 --> 03:56:46.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know horrify me probably
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
some good is being done or perhaps the
 
03:56:51.630 --> 03:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
um morals and ideology of the office
 
03:56:53.429 --> 03:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
worker are contrary to your
 
03:56:56.349 --> 03:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
own um you know a pro-life person might
 
03:56:57.750 --> 03:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
be very upset that their money is being
 
03:56:59.830 --> 03:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
invested in firms that take active steps
 
03:57:01.030 --> 03:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh in the other
 
03:57:03.630 --> 03:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
direction I think that the culture war
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
in the US is already all consuming
 
03:57:08.910 --> 03:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
enough uh that we do not need to have uh
 
03:57:10.870 --> 03:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
Advocates showing up at these meetings
 
03:57:12.349 --> 03:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
saying you know the governor has to fire
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
so and so and put in someone else so
 
03:57:16.630 --> 03:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
that you know my preferred investment
 
03:57:18.990 --> 03:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
strategy is used when we are sort of
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
squandering some of our potential
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
returns for
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
retirees um if we default to just
 
03:57:27.189 --> 03:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
pragmatic mathematical hey let's you
 
03:57:29.550 --> 03:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
know go into an index fund um you know
 
03:57:31.790 --> 03:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
hedge appropriately Etc uh then this is
 
03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
an entire um front in the culture war
 
03:57:36.189 --> 03:57:36.199 align:start position:0%
that we don't expand to and we can just
 
03:57:38.229 --> 03:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
prioritize you know I I think we're all
 
03:57:40.870 --> 03:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
happy to live in a world where we can be
 
03:57:42.670 --> 03:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
confident that the roads outside are
 
03:57:44.269 --> 03:57:44.279 align:start position:0%
paved by The Firm that put in the best
 
03:57:47.070 --> 03:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
quote not the best quote from a firm
 
03:57:49.149 --> 03:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
that had politics similar to the uh you
 
03:57:50.670 --> 03:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
know DPW
 
03:57:52.990 --> 03:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner the second argument I have
 
03:57:55.309 --> 03:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
is utilitarian and uh it just goes over
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
some of the same space uh that
 
03:57:59.630 --> 03:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
represented belra touched on which is
 
03:58:02.269 --> 03:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
anytime you put in a second priority you
 
03:58:05.149 --> 03:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
are deprioritizing the first issue if we
 
03:58:09.349 --> 03:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
were running a um uh a Symphony and we
 
03:58:10.910 --> 03:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
are looking for the best violinist in
 
03:58:13.189 --> 03:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
the world that person is out there um
 
03:58:14.349 --> 03:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
and we can rank order you know there's
 
03:58:17.110 --> 03:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
the top 10 or 15 but if we say hey let's
 
03:58:19.790 --> 03:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
get the best Albanian violinist I'm sure
 
03:58:21.510 --> 03:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
Albania has some good violinists it's
 
03:58:23.189 --> 03:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
even possible that the world's best
 
03:58:26.269 --> 03:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
violinist is Albanian but probably if we
 
03:58:28.590 --> 03:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
limit ourselves the top violinist we're
 
03:58:31.229 --> 03:58:31.239 align:start position:0%
going to get is the 31st best violinist
 
03:58:33.309 --> 03:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
and the next one is going to be the 73rd
 
03:58:34.750 --> 03:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
that's just a simple matter of when
 
03:58:36.830 --> 03:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
you're looking in any data set and
 
03:58:38.910 --> 03:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
trying to you know limit or filter by a
 
03:58:41.229 --> 03:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
certain thing it is very unlikely that
 
03:58:45.030 --> 03:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to get as good results um
 
03:58:47.950 --> 03:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
and uh that is you know representative
 
03:58:50.110 --> 03:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
Belcher did a great job uh and so he
 
03:58:52.389 --> 03:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
stole about 80% of my lines I'm happy to
 
03:58:54.990 --> 03:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
answer questions thank you are there
 
03:58:57.870 --> 03:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative laus thank you
 
03:59:00.149 --> 03:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
this kind of uh relates to the earlier
 
03:59:02.469 --> 03:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
questions you said that if you have uh
 
03:59:03.830 --> 03:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
more than one criteria you're going to
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
water down what the main goal is well
 
03:59:09.070 --> 03:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
right now the the one and only criteria
 
03:59:11.830 --> 03:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're permitted is you know the best
 
03:59:13.229 --> 03:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
return over the appropriate time period
 
03:59:16.910 --> 03:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
with a uh you know uh reasonable risk
 
03:59:19.870 --> 03:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
now personally I think the chance of an
 
03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
ESG fund having the best return
 
03:59:24.349 --> 03:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
especially over the longer term is
 
03:59:26.910 --> 03:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
extremely low but still if you're going
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
to prohibit it then you're um aren't you
 
03:59:33.590 --> 03:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
U removing that as an option for good
 
03:59:34.990 --> 03:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
return by the way it's it's not the
 
03:59:36.670 --> 03:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
retirees that are going to be hurt it's
 
03:59:38.110 --> 03:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers who are going to cover the
 
03:59:38.120 --> 03:59:39.110 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers who are going to cover the
gap

03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
gap
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and uh you know
 
03:59:43.030 --> 03:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think it deals a a good blow to
 
03:59:44.750 --> 03:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
the argument but certainly it had some
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
hoisted on petard uh or if I said you
 
03:59:48.750 --> 03:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
know hey if you filter away 99% of the
 
03:59:50.269 --> 03:59:50.279 align:start position:0%
funds the remaining 1% and you're saying
 
03:59:52.229 --> 03:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
you know but if you filter away 1% of
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
the funds might that not have included
 
03:59:57.830 --> 03:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
the best funds and uh that is true um
 
03:59:59.870 --> 03:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
however given that ESG are relatively
 
04:00:02.429 --> 04:00:02.439 align:start position:0%
small uh percentage of funds and given
 
04:00:03.870 --> 04:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
that there have been studies showing
 
04:00:06.750 --> 04:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
that ESG funds consistently underperform
 
04:00:10.389 --> 04:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
um the CR IA behind ESG funds are
 
04:00:12.030 --> 04:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
usually fairly restrictive so they
 
04:00:13.750 --> 04:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
immediately knock out you know sort of
 
04:00:15.790 --> 04:00:15.800 align:start position:0%
every defense contractor every you know
 
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
small arms manufacturer anyone who emits
 
04:00:20.510 --> 04:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
carbon um so you end up first of all as
 
04:00:22.389 --> 04:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
a percentage of all of the funds in the
 
04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
market uh really radically constricting
 
04:00:26.389 --> 04:00:26.399 align:start position:0%
it and then second of the things that
 
04:00:28.149 --> 04:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
those funds invest in so sort of a
 
04:00:30.149 --> 04:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
second order thing are also hugely
 
04:00:33.630 --> 04:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
restricted so while it is possible uh
 
04:00:35.510 --> 04:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
that just out of dumb luck a particular
 
04:00:37.630 --> 04:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
ESG fund might be the best in the market
 
04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
I think in the real World you'd probably
 
04:00:40.550 --> 04:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
have to get you know 2,000 years of
 
04:00:42.269 --> 04:00:42.279 align:start position:0%
returns before You' find one year where
 
04:00:43.870 --> 04:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
it would have worked the other way right
 
04:00:46.870 --> 04:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree thank you don't argue
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
with them representative
 
04:00:52.269 --> 04:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
leus are there any other
 
04:00:54.349 --> 04:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
04:00:56.240 --> 04:00:56.250 align:start position:0%
for your time Mr
 
04:00:56.250 --> 04:01:06.950 align:start position:0%
for your time Mr
[Music]

04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
Carlin thank you Madam chair uh Marty
 
04:01:11.229 --> 04:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
Carlin representing the New Hampshire
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
retirement system I do have some uh
 
04:01:18.510 --> 04:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
statement um on House Bill 1267 I'm not
 
04:01:20.110 --> 04:01:20.120 align:start position:0%
going to read it entirely into the
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
record but I would like to refer to
 
04:01:25.469 --> 04:01:25.479 align:start position:0%
pieces of it and initial comment about
 
04:01:28.750 --> 04:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh this bill um as many committee folks
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
who've been on this committee for a
 
04:01:33.710 --> 04:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
while um know NH HRS generally does not
 
04:01:35.389 --> 04:01:35.399 align:start position:0%
take a position on
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
legislation uh regarding benefits
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
changes things like that or
 
04:01:43.269 --> 04:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
administration of the system um however
 
04:01:45.389 --> 04:01:45.399 align:start position:0%
when there are fiduciary or plan
 
04:01:49.189 --> 04:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
qualification issues uh the board may u
 
04:01:52.590 --> 04:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
opt to U oppose a bill uh our board
 
04:01:55.349 --> 04:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't had a chance to vote on uh this
 
04:01:57.750 --> 04:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
and another bill proposed in the Senate
 
04:02:00.389 --> 04:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
yet they're meeting in um in a couple of
 
04:02:02.670 --> 04:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
weeks but the uh legislative Committee
 
04:02:05.149 --> 04:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
of the board which was five of the 13
 
04:02:07.550 --> 04:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
members is going to be unanimously
 
04:02:10.349 --> 04:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
recommend to the board uh that they
 
04:02:12.590 --> 04:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
oppose this legislation on both
 
04:02:16.030 --> 04:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
fiduciary and plan qualification grounds
 
04:02:20.550 --> 04:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking um we're not cons
 
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's the opposition isn't about ESG and
 
04:02:27.269 --> 04:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
in in uh in a vacuum it's it's um
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
generally any changes uh legislative
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
changes mandates to um the investment
 
04:02:36.790 --> 04:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
program could potentially limit limit or
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
in some cases run counter or two our
 
04:02:41.229 --> 04:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty to act solely in the best
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
interest of the membership at all times
 
04:02:46.110 --> 04:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
um couple of statutory and
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional citations I just want to
 
04:02:52.990 --> 04:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
put into the record is uh RSA 100 A51 a
 
04:02:57.469 --> 04:02:57.479 align:start position:0%
A1 uh which as a a151 is a definition of
 
04:02:59.910 --> 04:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duties that's modeled on the
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code um and it includes
 
04:03:05.189 --> 04:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
that TR the board and independent
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
investment committee must make all
 
04:03:09.910 --> 04:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
decisions quot solely in the interest of
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
participants and
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries um besides the statutory
 
04:03:16.429 --> 04:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
section the article 36a of the New
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution reads in part uh
 
04:03:22.030 --> 04:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
all the assets proceeds and income there
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
from from the New Hampshire retirement
 
04:03:26.110 --> 04:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
system dot dot dot shall be held
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
invested or or dispersed in trust for
 
04:03:32.229 --> 04:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
the exclusive purpose of providing such
 
04:03:34.750 --> 04:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
benefits and shall not be encumbered for
 
04:03:38.910 --> 04:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
or diverted to any other purposes so
 
04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
in in English we the goal has always
 
04:03:44.750 --> 04:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
been to make prudent long-term investing
 
04:03:48.389 --> 04:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
Investments to maximize a value for our
 
04:03:50.550 --> 04:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
participants and for taxpayers in New
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and choose Investments that
 
04:03:54.670 --> 04:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
give us the best chance of meeting or
 
04:03:57.149 --> 04:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
exceeding our assume rate of return uh
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
over the long-term while balancing risk
 
04:04:03.630 --> 04:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
and and liquidity uh concerns uh ESG
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
which is has multiple definitions I
 
04:04:09.229 --> 04:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
don't think there's agreed upon full
 
04:04:12.269 --> 04:04:12.279 align:start position:0%
definition for it but regardless of
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
whether you would say that agree with
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
that or not neither ESG or any
 
04:04:19.469 --> 04:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
non-pecuniary factor is considered as an
 
04:04:21.950 --> 04:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
end unto itself um in investment
 
04:04:24.149 --> 04:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
decisions it's one of many factors
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
viewed in regard to the potential impact
 
04:04:29.070 --> 04:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
on our ability to obtain the highest
 
04:04:32.590 --> 04:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
return so um it's not disqualifying and
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
it it's not qualifying it's it's it's
 
04:04:37.229 --> 04:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
one of many factors if you were going to
 
04:04:38.590 --> 04:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
take a trip across cross country you
 
04:04:40.110 --> 04:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just look at the weather report
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
you'd look at the condition of your
 
04:04:43.389 --> 04:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
tires and what you know the you know
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that go into
 
04:04:46.830 --> 04:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
making an investment decision as a
 
04:04:50.110 --> 04:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
fiduciary and this doesn't control
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
anything so any any attempt to sort of
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
limit the the scope of finding the best
 
04:04:59.550 --> 04:04:59.560 align:start position:0%
financial opportunities to invest in for
 
04:05:02.149 --> 04:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
our members whether it's investment
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
divestment what have you you know could
 
04:05:07.349 --> 04:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
could constrain their fiduciary duty to
 
04:05:09.389 --> 04:05:09.399 align:start position:0%
act in the bank best interests at all
 
04:05:12.030 --> 04:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
times now since there was a similar Bill
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
proposed last year in the house house
 
04:05:13.680 --> 04:05:14.910 align:start position:0%
proposed last year in the house house
bill

04:05:14.910 --> 04:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:05:17.870 --> 04:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
339 uh that was amended uh to a
 
04:05:19.550 --> 04:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
quarterly reporting requirement and
 
04:05:21.950 --> 04:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
since that took effect uh for both
 
04:05:24.910 --> 04:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
Treasury and and for nhrs uh we've been
 
04:05:26.790 --> 04:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
submitting quarterly statements to the
 
04:05:29.349 --> 04:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh legislative budget Assistance Office
 
04:05:31.229 --> 04:05:31.239 align:start position:0%
uh they were in compliance with our duty
 
04:05:33.630 --> 04:05:33.640 align:start position:0%
to make all investment decisions solely
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
in the interest of the participants and
 
04:05:38.389 --> 04:05:38.399 align:start position:0%
do not have any Investments and any fund
 
04:05:40.110 --> 04:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
that have mixed rather than sole
 
04:05:42.750 --> 04:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
investment in motivation so not only are
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
we doing it we're certifying to it on a
 
04:05:48.510 --> 04:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis um this opposition in
 
04:05:50.590 --> 04:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
general again not to the specific Bill
 
04:05:52.710 --> 04:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
about the specific topic uh but
 
04:05:55.149 --> 04:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
04:05:55.159 --> 04:05:57.030 align:start position:0%
opposition to
legislative

04:05:57.030 --> 04:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
um mandates involving Investments is not
 
04:06:03.550 --> 04:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
new back in the 80s um there was a
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
movement uh on called the McBride
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
principles where um to divest from
 
04:06:10.630 --> 04:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
companies that weren't doing enough uh
 
04:06:12.309 --> 04:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
for underrepresented minorities in
 
04:06:14.910 --> 04:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
Northern Ireland I.E Catholics and at
 
04:06:19.710 --> 04:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
the time um and HRS uh opposed that and
 
04:06:22.269 --> 04:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
its external Council made the point
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
which which we continue to agree with
 
04:06:23.920 --> 04:06:25.510 align:start position:0%
which which we continue to agree with
that

04:06:25.510 --> 04:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:06:29.870 --> 04:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
um using any other Factor would um mean
 
04:06:32.790 --> 04:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
we were no longer using the exclusive
 
04:06:34.590 --> 04:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
purpose of providing benefits is our
 
04:06:34.600 --> 04:06:35.670 align:start position:0%
purpose of providing benefits is our
sole

04:06:35.670 --> 04:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
sole
 
04:06:38.590 --> 04:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
investment uh motivation it would also
 
04:06:40.269 --> 04:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
be it would also be a Divergent
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
collateral purpose of affecting social
 
04:06:45.870 --> 04:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
or political change so uh in summary we
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
believe that this legislation could only
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
limit our ability as fiduciaries to act
 
04:06:51.309 --> 04:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
solely in the best interest of our
 
04:06:53.790 --> 04:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
membership and maintain our status as a
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
qualified pension trust We Believe
 
04:06:59.469 --> 04:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
existing law already uh serves that
 
04:07:01.710 --> 04:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
purpose and this is
 
04:07:04.830 --> 04:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary thank you are there any
 
04:07:07.070 --> 04:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
questions I'd like to say that I did
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
receive the quarterly report from both
 
04:07:11.070 --> 04:07:11.080 align:start position:0%

04:07:13.950 --> 04:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
treasurer that they are investing as
 
04:07:15.309 --> 04:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately as
 
04:07:18.189 --> 04:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
necessary I'm on the list of
 
04:07:18.199 --> 04:07:19.950 align:start position:0%
necessary I'm on the list of
designated

04:07:19.950 --> 04:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
designated
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
recipients all right thank you Mr Carlin
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.720 --> 04:07:41.870 align:start position:0%
 
hamberton

04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:43.590 --> 04:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
are you all
 
04:07:46.269 --> 04:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
ready good afternoon my name is Hunter
 
04:07:48.389 --> 04:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
hamberlin I'm the state policy manager
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayers protection Alliance
 
04:07:54.229 --> 04:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
TPA is a nonpartisan nonprofit consumer
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
and taxpayer Watchdog
 
04:07:57.910 --> 04:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
organization I would like to first start
 
04:07:59.550 --> 04:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
off by thanking chair will McGuire and
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee members for
 
04:08:02.309 --> 04:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify today
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
respectfully TPA opposes hb1 1267 an act
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
relating to prohibiting ESG standards
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
and government Investments I've already
 
04:08:12.550 --> 04:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony and a
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
coalition letter uh in regards to this
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill and for the purposes of everybody's
 
04:08:19.590 --> 04:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
time I'm just going to give the
 
04:08:21.910 --> 04:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
highlights so first off we believe this
 
04:08:24.109 --> 04:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
legislation to be arbitrary as some of
 
04:08:25.830 --> 04:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
the other testifiers have said uh
 
04:08:27.229 --> 04:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
there's already legislation on the books
 
04:08:29.389 --> 04:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
that kind of deals with this stuff uh
 
04:08:31.389 --> 04:08:31.399 align:start position:0%
specifically the legislature passed HB
 
04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
457 last year and the governor passed an
 
04:08:36.229 --> 04:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
executive order to minimize risk and
 
04:08:38.990 --> 04:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
maximize Returns on State Investments
 
04:08:41.510 --> 04:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
hp1 1267 does not build on either of
 
04:08:43.309 --> 04:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
these policies and it would do more harm
 
04:08:43.319 --> 04:08:44.269 align:start position:0%
these policies and it would do more harm
than

04:08:44.269 --> 04:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:08:46.590 --> 04:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
good second there is no crime in
 
04:08:48.910 --> 04:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
investing in ESG yet this bill would
 
04:08:50.429 --> 04:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
make it a felony to consider ESG
 
04:08:53.309 --> 04:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
criteria in certain State funds Banning
 
04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
investment and ESG funds limits options
 
04:08:58.429 --> 04:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
for investors as does mandating
 
04:09:01.109 --> 04:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
investment and ESG funds investment fund
 
04:09:03.469 --> 04:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
managers like other testifiers have said
 
04:09:04.830 --> 04:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
they have a legal and fiduciary
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility to their clients already
 
04:09:09.469 --> 04:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
government involvement like this bill is
 
04:09:11.550 --> 04:09:11.560 align:start position:0%

04:09:32.309 --> 04:09:32.319 align:start position:0%

any approach to ESG that is not
 
04:09:36.670 --> 04:09:36.680 align:start position:0%

taxpayers and cons consumers TPA

good afternoon I'm Michelle theey I am
 
04:10:51.550 --> 04:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire businesses for social
 
04:10:53.710 --> 04:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility which is an organization
 
04:10:57.149 --> 04:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
of over 240 businesses in the state and
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
and as well as stakeholders um who are
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
interested in exactly the things that
 
04:11:06.109 --> 04:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
are compose ESG the environmental social
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
and governance factors
 
04:11:10.670 --> 04:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
um my testimony which you have in
 
04:11:14.630 --> 04:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
writing shares that ESG factors work to
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
strengthen financial performance if if
 
04:11:21.870 --> 04:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
hb1 1267 actually seeks to maximize
 
04:11:24.630 --> 04:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
return for State investment ESG
 
04:11:27.469 --> 04:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
evaluation is designed to support that
 
04:11:31.070 --> 04:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
very goal too often the acronyms become
 
04:11:33.910 --> 04:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
partis become targets for partisan
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
politics and the true value of or
 
04:11:39.870 --> 04:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
meaning of of their use gets lost ESG
 
04:11:42.790 --> 04:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
ratings are used to understand how a
 
04:11:45.469 --> 04:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
company is doing relative to others on
 
04:11:48.070 --> 04:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
important issues like protecting
 
04:11:50.910 --> 04:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
consumer data and privacy worker
 
04:11:54.109 --> 04:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
training chemical safety executive
 
04:11:57.389 --> 04:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
compet compensation and more would you
 
04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
want to know whether a company you're
 
04:12:02.109 --> 04:12:02.119 align:start position:0%
investing in has major Financial Risk
 
04:12:04.389 --> 04:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
because they're not properly managing
 
04:12:04.399 --> 04:12:06.269 align:start position:0%
because they're not properly managing
contaminated

04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
contaminated
 
04:12:08.670 --> 04:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
Wastewater these are the basic me
 
04:12:10.990 --> 04:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
measures that help Professionals in
 
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
financial management Fields understand
 
04:12:16.590 --> 04:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
all of the risks and opportunities that
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
might be material to long-term financial
 
04:12:22.429 --> 04:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
success this kind of analysis is similar
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
to the steps that a bank requires when
 
04:12:26.670 --> 04:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
any of us are trying to secure a
 
04:12:29.469 --> 04:12:29.479 align:start position:0%
mortgage on our homes and we personally
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
require in order to make sure that we're
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
protecting our investment most of us
 
04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
would not consider signing on the da
 
04:12:39.389 --> 04:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
line before having a home inspector
 
04:12:42.510 --> 04:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
verify issues like lead leaks or mold
 
04:12:44.830 --> 04:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
and certainly not without a clear title
 
04:12:47.349 --> 04:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
search it's important to know that your
 
04:12:49.389 --> 04:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
investment starts off strong or that you
 
04:12:51.750 --> 04:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
at least know where what you're up
 
04:12:54.429 --> 04:12:54.439 align:start position:0%
against taking away tools that a
 
04:12:57.070 --> 04:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
financial professional deems important
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
limits their ability to make the
 
04:13:02.070 --> 04:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
strongest possible decisions imagine
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
that instead of buying a home you're
 
04:13:06.429 --> 04:13:06.439 align:start position:0%
responsible for investing Millions even
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars on behalf of other
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
people and not just the dollars for any
 
04:13:13.870 --> 04:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
people the retirement Savings of
 
04:13:16.910 --> 04:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
hardworking public
 
04:13:19.229 --> 04:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
employees should those be limited to
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
just short-term
 
04:13:23.670 --> 04:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
profits or should you take into
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
consideration the risks a company might
 
04:13:29.790 --> 04:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
face in the future or other factors
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
known to materially impact a firm's
 
04:13:34.469 --> 04:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
long-term financial performance and
 
04:13:37.389 --> 04:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
ability to thrive in a rapidly changing
 
04:13:41.309 --> 04:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
World ESG is used because it provides
 
04:13:44.830 --> 04:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
value both to companies trying to access
 
04:13:48.189 --> 04:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
assess their own progress which is why
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
90% of the
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
S&amp;P um companies create ESG reports and
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
more importantly they're valuable to
 
04:13:59.630 --> 04:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
investors understanding a company's in
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
environmental track record how it treats
 
04:14:05.109 --> 04:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
its Workforce and the transparency of
 
04:14:08.149 --> 04:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
its Financial controls allow for both
 
04:14:11.309 --> 04:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
responsible and profitable investing for
 
04:14:13.229 --> 04:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
these reasons we encourage this
 
04:14:16.469 --> 04:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
committee to vote to oppose HB
 
04:14:18.910 --> 04:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
1267 thank you and I'm happy to take
 
04:14:22.590 --> 04:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any thank
 
04:14:24.910 --> 04:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
you I don't see any so thank you for
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:37.309 --> 04:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
Maham uh thank you madam chair members
 
04:14:38.910 --> 04:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Jim Monahan
 
04:14:41.109 --> 04:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
with the dwunk group I'm here today on
 
04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
behalf of siries uh which is a national
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization uh with many
 
04:14:48.429 --> 04:14:48.439 align:start position:0%
members in New Hampshire focused on uh
 
04:14:50.229 --> 04:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
sustainability uh in the business
 
04:14:53.550 --> 04:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
Community um we are opposed to um House
 
04:14:53.560 --> 04:14:54.950 align:start position:0%
Community um we are opposed to um House
Bill

04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:14:58.109 --> 04:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
1267 um and as my as is my practice
 
04:14:59.710 --> 04:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
often times bills like this I start from
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
the back of the bill and work my way up
 
04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
and the fiscal note I think is quite
 
04:15:05.229 --> 04:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
telling and the representatives of
 
04:15:07.269 --> 04:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
retirement fund I think did a admirable
 
04:15:09.950 --> 04:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
job of uh walking the committee through
 
04:15:11.910 --> 04:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the challenges that it would
 
04:15:14.950 --> 04:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
create um which inform the fiscal note
 
04:15:16.830 --> 04:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
um as I work my way back up through the
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
bill I also was um you know it has been
 
04:15:22.030 --> 04:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned here but I think it uh it
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
strikes me as a relatively extreme
 
04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
provision of the bill and that is
 
04:15:27.550 --> 04:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
creating a felony that would imprison
 
04:15:30.429 --> 04:15:30.439 align:start position:0%
somebody from for up to 20 years uh for
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
undertaking their uh work uh fulfilling
 
04:15:34.189 --> 04:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
their fiduciary
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility um I had presented uh
 
04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
testimony to you from series and I won't
 
04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
read that to you but I will attempt to
 
04:15:42.870 --> 04:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
summarize it and answer any questions
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
that you all may have um uh in essence
 
04:15:50.109 --> 04:15:50.119 align:start position:0%
what the uh the bill is doing is asking
 
04:15:51.710 --> 04:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
the state government to interfere with
 
04:15:54.309 --> 04:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
the uh Financial professionals judgment
 
04:15:57.229 --> 04:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
and fiduciary responsibility um as has
 
04:15:59.830 --> 04:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
been stated by uh others here today the
 
04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
consideration of ESG is a part of that
 
04:16:04.510 --> 04:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility um and
 
04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be disposed of um uh with a um
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh a government
 
04:16:13.149 --> 04:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
constraint um as was also mentioned this
 
04:16:15.109 --> 04:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
is not a brand new issue to the
 
04:16:16.830 --> 04:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
legislature in this committee uh we
 
04:16:18.750 --> 04:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
dealt with it last year with House Bill
 
04:16:21.109 --> 04:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
457 and I think a good compromise was
 
04:16:23.429 --> 04:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
struck there where it reinforced the
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
obligation to um act in a fiduciary
 
04:16:29.030 --> 04:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
responsible respon responsible way and
 
04:16:32.590 --> 04:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
provide information to um the chairman
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
of the committee and others uh in a
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
reporting process and that seems to be
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
working well um finally this is not the
 
04:16:41.030 --> 04:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh the only state where this issue has
 
04:16:44.429 --> 04:16:44.439 align:start position:0%
arisen um in recent years uh in Indiana
 
04:16:46.189 --> 04:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
last year for example there was a
 
04:16:47.670 --> 04:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
legislative commission that looked at
 
04:16:49.790 --> 04:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
the issue and determined that it created
 
04:16:53.910 --> 04:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
a $6.7 billion Financial would create a
 
04:16:57.229 --> 04:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
$6.7 billion dollar Financial loss uh to
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
the state pension plans uh and then also
 
04:17:04.109 --> 04:17:04.119 align:start position:0%
uh in recent years uh fiscal notes from
 
04:17:06.309 --> 04:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
Arkansas Kansas North Dakota Texas and
 
04:17:08.510 --> 04:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
Wyoming have raised similar concerns
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
about the risk um that bills like this
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
would put um on Pension funds so I've
 
04:17:15.750 --> 04:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
handed in the testimony um I'm happy to
 
04:17:17.149 --> 04:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
answer any questions get the committee
 
04:17:19.030 --> 04:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
additional information if they need it
 
04:17:21.070 --> 04:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
but uh in conclusion we are opposed to
 
04:17:22.910 --> 04:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:17:27.870 --> 04:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.550 --> 04:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.800 --> 04:17:49.189 align:start position:0%
 
HW

04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:54.109 --> 04:17:54.119 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair Maguire and uh yep

04:17:58.189 --> 04:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon chair Maguire and
 
04:18:00.030 --> 04:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
members of the House Edna committee this
 
04:18:01.910 --> 04:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
is my first time testifying before this
 
04:18:04.469 --> 04:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
committee so uh I am happy to be here
 
04:18:06.389 --> 04:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
and thank you for hearing my testimony
 
04:18:07.870 --> 04:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of the American
 
04:18:10.269 --> 04:18:10.279 align:start position:0%
Federation of teachers New Hampshire uh
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our 3700 members across the
 
04:18:15.870 --> 04:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
state we are teachers par Educators Town
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
employees University uh faculty uh we
 
04:18:21.469 --> 04:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
are those public employees that are in
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
the retirement system and we've got
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
thousands of retirees in the state as
 
04:18:26.750 --> 04:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
well so we do have an interest in how
 
04:18:28.630 --> 04:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
the uh funds of the state retirement
 
04:18:31.149 --> 04:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
system are invested we are o opposing
 
04:18:33.269 --> 04:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
this bill we are opposing it because it
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
would place an artificial limit on um
 
04:18:40.229 --> 04:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
how the retirement system balances risk
 
04:18:42.309 --> 04:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
versus the healthy rate of return that
 
04:18:44.910 --> 04:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
the state expects from uh the money in
 
04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
the retirement system um we are
 
04:18:51.269 --> 04:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
concerned that it would get in the way
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
of appropriately evaluating risk on
 
04:18:56.830 --> 04:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
anything that has to do with environment
 
04:18:59.429 --> 04:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
social or governance issues um you
 
04:19:00.349 --> 04:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
really want to know when you're
 
04:19:02.189 --> 04:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
investing in a company whether there's a
 
04:19:04.710 --> 04:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
huge exposure to lawsuits due to their
 
04:19:07.550 --> 04:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
environmental um you know polic IES or
 
04:19:09.710 --> 04:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
or something they've manufactured in the
 
04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
past it would be bad to invest because
 
04:19:14.590 --> 04:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
they're profitable now but there's U you
 
04:19:16.149 --> 04:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
know a ton of lawsuits coming down the
 
04:19:17.590 --> 04:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
pipeline you want to know that ahead of
 
04:19:23.070 --> 04:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
time um so we do not feel that this bill
 
04:19:27.790 --> 04:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
allows for the appropriate um balancing
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
of interests when you are making
 
04:19:34.109 --> 04:19:34.119 align:start position:0%
Investments of money that eventually you
 
04:19:35.550 --> 04:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
know is coming out of our members
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
pockets and needs to to be paid back to
 
04:19:42.590 --> 04:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
the retirees when they retire um forcing
 
04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
divestment from ESG funds has not worked
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
in the other states that have passed
 
04:19:49.590 --> 04:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
bills like this as another testifier
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh in
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
Arkansas there's been a loss of 30 to 40
 
04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
million a year so that's less Revenue
 
04:20:00.109 --> 04:20:00.119 align:start position:0%
their retirement system is taking in
 
04:20:02.189 --> 04:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
than they expected before they pass a
 
04:20:04.590 --> 04:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
bill like this uh our members who pay
 
04:20:06.149 --> 04:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
into the New Hampshire retirement system
 
04:20:08.229 --> 04:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
with every single paycheck they pay
 
04:20:11.389 --> 04:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
their portion of it they expect to be
 
04:20:14.269 --> 04:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
able to retire with dignity after a
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
lifetime of service to their communities
 
04:20:18.229 --> 04:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
you know they're out there working again
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
as teachers as police as Town employees
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
and they pay in every single paycheck
 
04:20:25.030 --> 04:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
they expect the money to be invested
 
04:20:27.750 --> 04:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
wisely to balance that risk and the
 
04:20:30.309 --> 04:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
return and and to have the bargain
 
04:20:32.590 --> 04:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
upheld when they retire so for that
 
04:20:34.510 --> 04:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
reason we oppose this and thank you for
 
04:20:36.309 --> 04:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony I will email
 
04:20:38.189 --> 04:20:38.199 align:start position:0%

04:21:27.550 --> 04:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
by reading a list of um of companies um
 
04:21:30.990 --> 04:21:31.000 align:start position:0%

the US
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
Congress now I share that list because
 
04:22:00.030 --> 04:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
that is a um a limited list of just some
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
of the uh bodies that are currently
 
04:22:06.149 --> 04:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
using data from risk factor Foundation
 
04:22:08.590 --> 04:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
um risk factor which is which is a
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
product of the First Street um
 
04:22:14.910 --> 04:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
foundation and that data set is um D
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
data that looks at climate risk and what
 
04:22:20.469 --> 04:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
may happen to properties um so thus you
 
04:22:22.229 --> 04:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
see the large concentration of real
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
estate bank and insurance um entities on
 
04:22:27.109 --> 04:22:27.119 align:start position:0%
that list of
 
04:22:29.870 --> 04:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
clients now we are seeing a a huge
 
04:22:32.429 --> 04:22:32.439 align:start position:0%
movement towards Industries beginning to
 
04:22:35.229 --> 04:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
pay attention to what climate risk May
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
mean for their investment
 
04:22:39.630 --> 04:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
ments um we when we were looking for
 
04:22:42.109 --> 04:22:42.119 align:start position:0%
homes in New Hampshire we um used
 
04:22:45.389 --> 04:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
realter.com and redin as as some of the
 
04:22:49.109 --> 04:22:49.119 align:start position:0%
real estate um guiding platforms um and
 
04:22:50.710 --> 04:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
we looked at their risk factor before
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
deciding which home to purchase so we
 
04:22:54.349 --> 04:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
knew that our major investment as a
 
04:22:57.469 --> 04:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
family would not be compromised um as
 
04:22:59.429 --> 04:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
climate change begins to become more and
 
04:23:01.229 --> 04:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
more apparent in our state with flooding
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
and other
 
04:23:06.750 --> 04:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
issues um I bring this all up because um
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
climate change risk is one of the very
 
04:23:11.189 --> 04:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
important aspects that is covered under
 
04:23:16.469 --> 04:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
an ESG um qualifications report and um
 
04:23:19.189 --> 04:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
not all anti- uh
 
04:23:22.870 --> 04:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
ESG um movements or policies are
 
04:23:25.109 --> 04:23:25.119 align:start position:0%
particularly focused on denying climate
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
change but some of them are um
 
04:23:31.590 --> 04:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
and we believe that is a a huge
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
disadvantage to um to New Hampshire
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
residents and to particularly are New
 
04:23:39.630 --> 04:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pensioners um to not be able
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
to take into account the realistic risks
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
um that come into play with climate
 
04:23:47.309 --> 04:23:47.319 align:start position:0%
change and one of the important ways of
 
04:23:49.670 --> 04:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
doing that is through um looking at the
 
04:23:51.109 --> 04:23:51.119 align:start position:0%
the ESG
 
04:23:54.309 --> 04:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
criteria um that is all that I came
 
04:23:56.469 --> 04:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
prepared to to share today um I'd be
 
04:23:58.389 --> 04:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
happy to take a question if there are
 
04:24:03.229 --> 04:24:03.239 align:start position:0%

okay represent broa do you wish to speak
 
04:24:59.830 --> 04:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
to your motion yes what motivates me to
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
um present this motion to the committee
 
04:25:06.149 --> 04:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
is that the New Hampshire retirement
 
04:25:08.269 --> 04:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
system has its own investment
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
criteria and that should be the one that
 
04:25:10.920 --> 04:25:11.750 align:start position:0%
criteria and that should be the one that
we

04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:25:15.030 --> 04:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
support and it should not um we should
 
04:25:18.790 --> 04:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
not be swayed by testimony on either
 
04:25:21.469 --> 04:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
side directing our attention to one
 
04:25:23.710 --> 04:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
thing or another and they the New
 
04:25:26.349 --> 04:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retiring system um has this
 
04:25:30.149 --> 04:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
covered and their investment strategies
 
04:25:32.469 --> 04:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are geared to benefit
 
04:25:35.070 --> 04:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
those who um participate in that
 
04:25:35.080 --> 04:25:36.710 align:start position:0%
those who um participate in that
fund

04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative leus I agree with
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative grota and what I'll add
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
is although I I tend to uh be on the
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
same side of this the whole ESG thing is
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
the sponsors um you know everybody has
 
04:25:50.309 --> 04:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
their own thing that they consider
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
important and um but you know trying to
 
04:25:57.189 --> 04:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
use the uh investment of the pension
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
system to promote or oppose any
 
04:26:01.790 --> 04:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
particular thing in Defence
 
04:26:03.070 --> 04:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
representative Grotto I will not use the
 
04:26:05.469 --> 04:26:05.479 align:start position:0%
term slippery slope but I will say it's
 
04:26:08.429 --> 04:26:08.439 align:start position:0%
a very bad precedent and uh and it's not
 
04:26:10.189 --> 04:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
something we should be
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:18.109 --> 04:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
questions okay in that case the motion
 
04:26:20.070 --> 04:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
is inexpedient to legislate and the
 
04:26:24.109 --> 04:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%

consent and we have four minutes before
 
04:27:30.389 --> 04:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:30.399 --> 04:27:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:37.550 --> 04:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:27:41.590 --> 04:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
C is Glen gonna chair or you g chair
 
04:27:47.189 --> 04:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
this tell me he's next up in line okay
 
04:27:50.349 --> 04:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
and so um can he go into executive
 
04:27:50.359 --> 04:28:04.830 align:start position:0%
and so um can he go into executive
session

04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.840 --> 04:31:58.469 align:start position:0%
 
minut

04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
all I was the chair of a commission on
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
the retirement system House Bill 145 1
 
04:32:09.790 --> 04:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
is a recommendation from that
 
04:32:12.990 --> 04:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
commission I am not sure if I personally
 
04:32:15.670 --> 04:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
support it or oppose it but I think it
 
04:32:17.950 --> 04:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
is important enough that it should be
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
brought to the legislature and debated
 
04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
so what it does is that it
 
04:32:27.790 --> 04:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
declares that for pension
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
purposes mandatory overtime is included
 
04:32:35.109 --> 04:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
in base pay the reason for that is that
 
04:32:36.670 --> 04:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:32:39.790 --> 04:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
overtime is included in your pension
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
only up to a certain percentage there
 
04:32:44.830 --> 04:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
are specific calculations about how to
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
do it but with the Recruitment and other
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
issues we have some employees are
 
04:32:55.750 --> 04:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
working a great deal of overtime
 
04:32:59.030 --> 04:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
employer uh because you can't leave your
 
04:33:05.551 --> 04:33:05.561 align:start position:0%
police station unattended you can't not
 
04:33:08.269 --> 04:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
have workers in the in
 
04:33:11.070 --> 04:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections you can't not have people in
 
04:33:13.590 --> 04:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
the state hospital that to keep an eye
 
04:33:18.150 --> 04:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
on the on the uh patients there so this
 
04:33:18.160 --> 04:33:19.551 align:start position:0%
on the on the uh patients there so this
says

04:33:19.551 --> 04:33:19.561 align:start position:0%
says
 
04:33:24.670 --> 04:33:24.680 align:start position:0%
that for pension purposes the employer
 
04:33:30.590 --> 04:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.109 --> 04:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
pay the employer definition is important
 
04:33:36.429 --> 04:33:36.439 align:start position:0%
because that eliminates the possibility
 
04:33:36.439 --> 04:33:37.949 align:start position:0%
because that eliminates the possibility
of

04:33:37.949 --> 04:33:37.959 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:33:41.230 --> 04:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
someone um manipulating their overtime
 
04:33:43.750 --> 04:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
to spike their pensions which is one of
 
04:33:46.670 --> 04:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
the reasons why overtime is limited if
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
the employer says you've got to work
 
04:33:51.789 --> 04:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
tonight that's not your choice you're
 
04:33:54.390 --> 04:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
not doing it to to uh inflate your
 
04:33:55.869 --> 04:33:55.879 align:start position:0%
pension you're doing it because
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to be there thank you
 
04:33:58.799 --> 04:34:00.390 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to be there thank you
representative

04:34:00.390 --> 04:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:34:02.910 --> 04:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
schm so
 
04:34:06.390 --> 04:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
um as I said
 
04:34:08.949 --> 04:34:08.959 align:start position:0%
this allows
 
04:34:11.949 --> 04:34:11.959 align:start position:0%
the full amount of any mandatory
 
04:34:14.590 --> 04:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
overtime to be included in base pay
 
04:34:17.510 --> 04:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
which will increase pensions to some
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
degree for those people who are forced
 
04:34:20.510 --> 04:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
to work
 
04:34:23.551 --> 04:34:23.561 align:start position:0%
overtime it is already paid for because
 
04:34:26.349 --> 04:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
the employee and the employer both make
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
contributions on the payroll not on base
 
04:34:32.310 --> 04:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
pay so
 
04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
it's there will be a fiscal impact of
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
course but it's less than it might be
 
04:34:42.150 --> 04:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise and I think it's a an issue of
 
04:34:44.750 --> 04:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
fairness to the employees I'll try to
 
04:34:46.629 --> 04:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
answer any questions so any questions
 
04:34:47.949 --> 04:34:47.959 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh represent MRA
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
py thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:34:57.269 --> 04:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
04:35:00.390 --> 04:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's very specifically says mandatory
 
04:35:03.869 --> 04:35:03.879 align:start position:0%
which means the employee has no choice
 
04:35:08.910 --> 04:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
at this point so from that point of
 
04:35:11.590 --> 04:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
they're not doing it to beef up their
 
04:35:15.029 --> 04:35:15.039 align:start position:0%
base pay for pension correct so it seems
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
like a logical fair thing to say they've
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
done their due diligence they have
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
served when they are asked to so they
 
04:35:28.029 --> 04:35:28.039 align:start position:0%
have to be compensated for that yes they
 
04:35:30.910 --> 04:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
are paid and including
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
overtime overtime pay is in their
 
04:35:36.910 --> 04:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
contracts but
 
04:35:39.990 --> 04:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
Beyond a certain level overtime is not
 
04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily included in their pension
 
04:35:45.310 --> 04:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
and for some people it can be
 
04:35:47.830 --> 04:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
significant the uh Department of
 
04:35:50.310 --> 04:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
Corrections for example is working
 
04:35:52.429 --> 04:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
significant overtime it has for the last
 
04:35:55.709 --> 04:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
few years that I'm sure of and probably
 
04:35:55.719 --> 04:35:56.830 align:start position:0%
few years that I'm sure of and probably
before

04:35:56.830 --> 04:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:36:00.510 --> 04:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
that follow up thank you similarly the
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
lnas and County nursing homes and where
 
04:36:08.230 --> 04:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
the good shortage of uh Personnel if it
 
04:36:10.189 --> 04:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
is if the employer decides it's
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
mandatory over time that's what would be
 
04:36:16.869 --> 04:36:16.879 align:start position:0%
included right now as as I believe Mr
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
Carlin will explain the employer reports
 
04:36:24.269 --> 04:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
base pay and then other pay which are
 
04:36:27.789 --> 04:36:27.799 align:start position:0%
handled differently but this would just
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
incl put the uh mandatory overtime into
 
04:36:36.470 --> 04:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
the base pay line representative Schmidt
 
04:36:39.551 --> 04:36:39.561 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh representative
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
Maguire you cited in your testimony a
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
couple of examples of uh State entities
 
04:36:49.750 --> 04:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
like Corrections and state hospital
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
where you simply have to have somebody
 
04:36:54.910 --> 04:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
there all the time uh and that's going
 
04:36:57.830 --> 04:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
to involve mandatory overtime have you
 
04:37:01.510 --> 04:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
looked at how what the total P at the
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
the total
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:12.750 --> 04:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
employer um panoply is uh with regard to
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
how many are going to be impacted by
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
this change I haven't examined it in
 
04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
great detail but I'm pretty sure that
 
04:37:23.070 --> 04:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
teachers don't get much overtime there
 
04:37:26.910 --> 04:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
are a few state employees that that do
 
04:37:30.349 --> 04:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
um the the snowplow drivers for example
 
04:37:31.349 --> 04:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
work work
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
overtime uh but I am sure that there are
 
04:37:34.719 --> 04:37:35.590 align:start position:0%
overtime uh but I am sure that there are
some

04:37:35.590 --> 04:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:37:38.750 --> 04:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
places where it is required to keep
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
staff on hand and I totally agree with
 
04:37:43.390 --> 04:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
you I'm just and that is the places
 
04:37:46.470 --> 04:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
where there will be mandatory overtime
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
they are largely police fire Corrections
 
04:37:52.269 --> 04:37:52.279 align:start position:0%
and a small amount in places like New
 
04:37:55.109 --> 04:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital um the nursing homes
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
may be I hadn't thought about that but
 
04:37:58.510 --> 04:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
that may be another case where you have
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
to keep people on hand absolutely thank
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
you any other questions
 
04:38:19.230 --> 04:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
Carlin thank you excuse me thank you Mr
 
04:38:25.109 --> 04:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
chair um Marty Carlin representing the
 
04:38:26.910 --> 04:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system and back
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
in the familiar position of not having
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh the retirement system not having a
 
04:38:33.470 --> 04:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
position on this proposal which is a
 
04:38:36.949 --> 04:38:36.959 align:start position:0%
policy decision uh as representative
 
04:38:41.709 --> 04:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
Maguire uh said already um since uh the
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
changes made in 2011 to the pension
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
system members who weren't vested by Jan
 
04:38:50.789 --> 04:38:50.799 align:start position:0%
uh January 1st of 2012 have had their
 
04:38:53.789 --> 04:38:53.799 align:start position:0%
pay reported differently uh folks who
 
04:38:55.590 --> 04:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
were vested prior to that it was
 
04:38:57.189 --> 04:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
everything was base pay everything that
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
was listed as earnable compensation and
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
the statue was treated as as base pay um
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
for the folks who weren't vested
 
04:39:07.709 --> 04:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
and as well as current and future recent
 
04:39:10.949 --> 04:39:10.959 align:start position:0%
hires um the employer is reporting base
 
04:39:14.750 --> 04:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
pay as one line in the monthly report
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
and then compensation over base um that
 
04:39:20.629 --> 04:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
includes U but is not limited to
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
overtime any kind of annual attendance
 
04:39:24.830 --> 04:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
bonuses if there was workers
 
04:39:27.150 --> 04:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
compensation supplemental pay longevity
 
04:39:30.150 --> 04:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
pay uh things like that so and that's
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's not broken out by type within
 
04:39:36.269 --> 04:39:36.279 align:start position:0%
comp over base uh the law also Al
 
04:39:39.430 --> 04:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
calculates uh pension benefits under the
 
04:39:41.190 --> 04:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
average final compensation it's a
 
04:39:44.750 --> 04:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
fiveyear average and it looks at the
 
04:39:48.310 --> 04:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
percentage of compensation over base pay
 
04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
versus base pay in the total in the
 
04:39:53.270 --> 04:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
bottom line as a percentage uh in each
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
year since since the data has been
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
available so since 2012 and then there's
 
04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
a formula that if the percentage of
 
04:40:02.708 --> 04:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
compensation over base in the high five
 
04:40:05.830 --> 04:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
years is lower than the uh higher than
 
04:40:09.390 --> 04:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
the percentage in the other years it is
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
um the lower percentage is applied so it
 
04:40:13.830 --> 04:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
it could serve to reduce there there's
 
04:40:16.510 --> 04:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
some variations with uh group two and
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
group one in that but just for the
 
04:40:20.310 --> 04:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
purposes of this discussion you know
 
04:40:22.628 --> 04:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
that's how it would work so so we see
 
04:40:25.708 --> 04:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
this bill uh prospectively as employers
 
04:40:30.030 --> 04:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
would be uh determining um whether uh
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
overtime is mandatory or not and
 
04:40:35.390 --> 04:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
Reporting it in the base payline to HRS
 
04:40:38.910 --> 04:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
going forward uh if uh if they make that
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
determination uh a proposal like this is
 
04:40:44.510 --> 04:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
is extremely hard if not impossible to
 
04:40:46.310 --> 04:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
put a price tag on because we don't know
 
04:40:48.868 --> 04:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
how many employers are going to Define
 
04:40:51.150 --> 04:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
it over time how much overtime people
 
04:40:52.750 --> 04:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
are actually getting in any of the four
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
groups now because it's not broken out
 
04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
as a separate entity as well and you
 
04:41:00.390 --> 04:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
know how uh future economic Trends are
 
04:41:03.190 --> 04:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
going to you know affect this benefit so
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's almost like it's going to have to
 
04:41:06.910 --> 04:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
play out over time actuar based on
 
04:41:09.150 --> 04:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
experience I mean I think representative
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
Maguire is 100% correct in saying that
 
04:41:13.750 --> 04:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
probably the group least affected by a
 
04:41:15.230 --> 04:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
bill like this is going to be teachers
 
04:41:17.190 --> 04:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
because they tend to be contract
 
04:41:19.550 --> 04:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
employees uh working a a set number of
 
04:41:22.230 --> 04:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
weeks there is a lot of overtime in in
 
04:41:24.868 --> 04:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
my experience with Educators but um
 
04:41:29.150 --> 04:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
besides uh Public Safety uh group two um
 
04:41:31.788 --> 04:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
you know again Highway workers County
 
04:41:33.990 --> 04:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
nurse places where they need coverage
 
04:41:35.830 --> 04:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
you know they need a set amount of
 
04:41:39.550 --> 04:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
people uh they are probably um employers
 
04:41:41.708 --> 04:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
may be forced to mandate people work
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
extra shifts just because of Workforce
 
04:41:47.070 --> 04:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
issues and other things so it it's sort
 
04:41:49.150 --> 04:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
of hard to to pin down what what this
 
04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
would cost but um glad to answer any
 
04:41:55.230 --> 04:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
questions anybody has thank you I've got
 
04:41:58.110 --> 04:41:58.120 align:start position:0%
a few actually U to start with one is
 
04:42:00.830 --> 04:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire uh mentioned As I
 
04:42:02.708 --> 04:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
understood it that the amount the
 
04:42:05.230 --> 04:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
employers are contributing both for the
 
04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
normal cost and presuming the the amount
 
04:42:09.990 --> 04:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
they pay to cover the unfunded liability
 
04:42:12.190 --> 04:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
is based on total payroll and so they're
 
04:42:15.470 --> 04:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
already paying um based on the amount
 
04:42:16.830 --> 04:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
they paying in overtime as well as
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
everything else is that correct that is
 
04:42:23.150 --> 04:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
correct okay and then um you know uh
 
04:42:24.788 --> 04:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
presumably there will be some amount
 
04:42:27.110 --> 04:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
extra paid out in uh
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
pensions and you know am I correct that
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
any such cost is going to end up
 
04:42:36.628 --> 04:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
increasing the unfunded liability and
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
therefore increasing the amount that all
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
the employers have to pay for that
 
04:42:42.350 --> 04:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
portion of what they pay into the
 
04:42:45.070 --> 04:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
pension system it it will increase the
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
costs I'm not sure how much of that is
 
04:42:50.190 --> 04:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
unfunded versus present value of future
 
04:42:52.350 --> 04:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
benefits uh you know normal cost type
 
04:42:54.750 --> 04:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
things but but yes to the extent that
 
04:42:57.550 --> 04:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
any individual benefits from this change
 
04:42:59.070 --> 04:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
such that their lifetime benefits going
 
04:43:01.230 --> 04:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
to be larger you know that that those
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
funds aren't accounted for so they would
 
04:43:05.150 --> 04:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
be uh paid through future employer
 
04:43:06.868 --> 04:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
contribution rates just kind of a follow
 
04:43:09.788 --> 04:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
up on that um since they're already
 
04:43:11.390 --> 04:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
paying the employers are already paying
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
the amount and the employees for that
 
04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
matter I guess are paying the amount
 
04:43:17.350 --> 04:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
based on their total payroll this won't
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
cause that to go up at all so whether
 
04:43:21.550 --> 04:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
it's called unfunded liability or what
 
04:43:22.670 --> 04:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's still going to come out of that
 
04:43:24.510 --> 04:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
portion of what the employers are paying
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
is that right it'll it'll it'll start
 
04:43:29.750 --> 04:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
showing up in future employer rates over
 
04:43:32.510 --> 04:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
time as experience you know in your
 
04:43:34.470 --> 04:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
retirement experience but there's no
 
04:43:37.708 --> 04:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
immediate you know way to Value this and
 
04:43:39.550 --> 04:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
you know the next rate setting valuation
 
04:43:43.830 --> 04:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
but over time if if this increases if
 
04:43:46.030 --> 04:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
this proposal on in the aggregate
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
increases benefits by you know
 
04:43:52.628 --> 04:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
05% for members or 5% you know that's
 
04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's the variable that
 
04:43:56.830 --> 04:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
we sure will need to
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
monitor okay and then the last one is I
 
04:44:00.948 --> 04:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
think almost asking you get your Ouija
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
board out but I guess the thing is is
 
04:44:04.628 --> 04:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
there any guess at least the order
 
04:44:07.310 --> 04:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
magnitude of what the total c a million
 
04:44:10.750 --> 04:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
10 million 100 million any I I
 
04:44:12.948 --> 04:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
understand the difficulties so so again
 
04:44:15.470 --> 04:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
this is employer defined mandatory over
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
time so so the closest thing you know
 
04:44:20.310 --> 04:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
and this isn't Apples to Apples I mean
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
this this is why it's not in in in the
 
04:44:23.948 --> 04:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
handout but um if you recall a couple
 
04:44:25.750 --> 04:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
weeks ago this committee heard House
 
04:44:25.760 --> 04:44:27.110 align:start position:0%
weeks ago this committee heard House
Bill

04:44:27.110 --> 04:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:44:30.948 --> 04:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
1653 uh and that uh made overtime for
 
04:44:33.750 --> 04:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
group two tier B members part of base
 
04:44:35.470 --> 04:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
pay so that was was that cohort of about
 
04:44:35.480 --> 04:44:36.270 align:start position:0%
pay so that was was that cohort of about
the,

04:44:36.270 --> 04:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
the,
 
04:44:40.030 --> 04:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
1650 members in group two and the fiscal
 
04:44:44.190 --> 04:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
note on that um I believe had a rate
 
04:44:46.230 --> 04:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
increase that would equate out to about
 
04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
3.4 million a year overall um on the
 
04:44:51.510 --> 04:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
group group two contributions for state
 
04:44:54.550 --> 04:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
and local employees so that this isn't
 
04:44:56.910 --> 04:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples but that that's that's
 
04:44:59.150 --> 04:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's a peg on the battleship board to
 
04:45:00.670 --> 04:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
to give you an
 
04:45:04.350 --> 04:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
idea okay thank you for that attempt um
 
04:45:06.190 --> 04:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know who was first but uh I
 
04:45:08.350 --> 04:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
guess I saw represent M puty first and
 
04:45:08.360 --> 04:45:08.990 align:start position:0%
guess I saw represent M puty first and
then

04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:45:14.110 --> 04:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.190 --> 04:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
G thank you Mr chair thank you for for
 
04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um she ear this is
 
04:45:23.868 --> 04:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying this would affect in one
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
way or the other but would
 
04:45:28.990 --> 04:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
you consider that this would help
 
04:45:33.310 --> 04:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
retention and Workforce longevity in a
 
04:45:36.430 --> 04:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
place where there is it's employer
 
04:45:39.350 --> 04:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
asking for a mandatory overtime so there
 
04:45:41.550 --> 04:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
is the investment from the employee to
 
04:45:44.390 --> 04:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
do the overtime an employer asking and
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's a reward for the employee for
 
04:45:48.868 --> 04:45:48.878 align:start position:0%
giving up their time when they didn't
 
04:45:53.310 --> 04:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
ask for it so that would that uh convert
 
04:45:57.430 --> 04:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
into a longevity or work for retention
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I don't think nhrs is qualified
 
04:46:01.788 --> 04:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
to give a definite opinion on that
 
04:46:03.788 --> 04:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I mean I that actually
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
that was one of the considerations in
 
04:46:08.070 --> 04:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
the retirement benefits commission um
 
04:46:10.628 --> 04:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
with that this came out of um you know
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
that that was part of the discussion
 
04:46:14.110 --> 04:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
there um I you know I don't know if
 
04:46:15.948 --> 04:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
there's anybody here from the municipal
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
Association or the school boards or the
 
04:46:20.708 --> 04:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
counties who might have more insight
 
04:46:22.470 --> 04:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
closer to the to the actual employer
 
04:46:25.830 --> 04:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
base than than we are representative
 
04:46:30.548 --> 04:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
groa yes I just want to do you in do you
 
04:46:30.558 --> 04:46:32.628 align:start position:0%
groa yes I just want to do you in do you
believe

04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:46:36.590 --> 04:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
that mandatory over time is defined
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
enough in our system so that we know how
 
04:46:43.628 --> 04:46:43.638 align:start position:0%
it would be calculated which I mean is
 
04:46:45.230 --> 04:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
there enough understanding of what
 
04:46:47.670 --> 04:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory overtime means so that we
 
04:46:50.990 --> 04:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't have discrepancies between
 
04:46:53.868 --> 04:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
departments what I I I think the the the
 
04:46:56.070 --> 04:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
goal of this is to give the employer the
 
04:46:58.750 --> 04:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
control so so mandatory is in the eye of
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
the the employer um you know so
 
04:47:05.948 --> 04:47:05.958 align:start position:0%
they're there was no standard definition
 
04:47:07.708 --> 04:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
of mandatory because the employer is
 
04:47:09.708 --> 04:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
going to weigh that and
 
04:47:12.150 --> 04:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
decide you
 
04:47:16.070 --> 04:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
know up so because I know nothing about
 
04:47:17.990 --> 04:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
I mean I just want to understand
 
04:47:18.000 --> 04:47:19.510 align:start position:0%
I mean I just want to understand
mandatory

04:47:19.510 --> 04:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
04:47:22.270 --> 04:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
overtime let's say that someone needs to
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
fill a
 
04:47:25.868 --> 04:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
slot and there's two people that raise
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
their hand does it become ratory over
 
04:47:31.390 --> 04:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
time since two people are offering to
 
04:47:34.868 --> 04:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
work you see how this can get
 
04:47:37.310 --> 04:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh representative that that's
 
04:47:40.350 --> 04:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
a good example I I'm not really versed
 
04:47:42.788 --> 04:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
well enough to to make that ultimately
 
04:47:44.230 --> 04:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to be up to the employer I
 
04:47:47.390 --> 04:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
mean I think you know you one you know
 
04:47:49.270 --> 04:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know either through a Personnel
 
04:47:51.470 --> 04:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
policy or or collectively bargain the
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
definition you know on an employer by
 
04:47:53.520 --> 04:47:55.868 align:start position:0%
definition you know on an employer by
employer

04:47:55.868 --> 04:47:55.878 align:start position:0%
employer
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
basis okay uh representative G uh my
 
04:48:00.830 --> 04:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
questions were exactly what
 
04:48:04.708 --> 04:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
representative Grody asked and having
 
04:48:06.990 --> 04:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
been in those shoes as an employer and
 
04:48:09.350 --> 04:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
an employee I think it's very fuzzy I I
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
think it's something to be concerned
 
04:48:13.470 --> 04:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
about with this I mean one one thing NH
 
04:48:16.430 --> 04:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
HRS would be cons would would monitor
 
04:48:18.310 --> 04:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
through you know you know random
 
04:48:20.110 --> 04:48:20.120 align:start position:0%
employer Audits and things like that is
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
whatever the policy is that it's
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
consistently applied to all members and
 
04:48:27.070 --> 04:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
all groups because if if it you know it
 
04:48:29.830 --> 04:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
is carve outs and things that that
 
04:48:32.190 --> 04:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
become could down the road become a plan
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
qualification thing but just you know
 
04:48:36.110 --> 04:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
consistent application of a standard is
 
04:48:38.590 --> 04:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
something something we would try to
 
04:48:43.150 --> 04:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
require from employers so it's not
 
04:48:46.708 --> 04:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
arbitrary representative C so this um is
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
this consistent application is that
 
04:48:51.548 --> 04:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
something then how would we how would
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
that happen I mean how could it do you
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
have Ru making or authority or anything
 
04:48:59.070 --> 04:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
like that to mandate
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
that again you know compliance with the
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
statute I think just in general enal
 
04:49:08.548 --> 04:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
terms would um require consistency but I
 
04:49:11.430 --> 04:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
I I think you know mechanically um you
 
04:49:13.948 --> 04:49:13.958 align:start position:0%
know we would probably create a form
 
04:49:15.390 --> 04:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
that the board could approve for an
 
04:49:15.400 --> 04:49:16.830 align:start position:0%
that the board could approve for an
employer

04:49:16.830 --> 04:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
employer
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
to submit you know to you know to say
 
04:49:22.910 --> 04:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're reporting overtime is
 
04:49:24.910 --> 04:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory or not so we'd have a record
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
of who's doing it and who's not if you
 
04:49:28.910 --> 04:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
know Manchester does and nashille it
 
04:49:30.628 --> 04:49:30.638 align:start position:0%
dozen or something like that we we would
 
04:49:34.150 --> 04:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
want to know as long as all the Apple in
 
04:49:36.270 --> 04:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
the Manchester bucket or in the OR
 
04:49:38.030 --> 04:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
apples and all the oranges and that you
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
know type of thing so so I think we
 
04:49:43.868 --> 04:49:43.878 align:start position:0%
would look for some declaration or
 
04:49:45.548 --> 04:49:45.558 align:start position:0%
statement or attestation from an
 
04:49:47.628 --> 04:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
employer as to what they're doing so
 
04:49:49.548 --> 04:49:49.558 align:start position:0%
that there's no ambigu ambiguity going
 
04:49:51.788 --> 04:49:51.798 align:start position:0%
forward with folks retiring from that
 
04:49:54.030 --> 04:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
employer when the time comes and again
 
04:49:56.708 --> 04:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
this this doesn't affect overtime paid
 
04:49:58.788 --> 04:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
over the career before the effective
 
04:50:00.190 --> 04:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
date of the bill we wouldn't be able to
 
04:50:02.190 --> 04:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
unscramble that egg so this is only a
 
04:50:06.910 --> 04:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:09.430 --> 04:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
forward any other questions from the
 
04:50:12.868 --> 04:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
committee uh represent M py thank you
 
04:50:16.350 --> 04:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair sorry thank you m chair and
 
04:50:18.990 --> 04:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my another question
 
04:50:23.110 --> 04:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
so this is only for moving forward not
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
the ones that are there um already in
 
04:50:30.110 --> 04:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
the system right yeah we we wouldn't
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
have the data to be able to go backwards
 
04:50:34.948 --> 04:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
and say what was mandatory you know
 
04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
after I mean no employer has deter has
 
04:50:39.910 --> 04:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
defined it yet as mandatory so it you
 
04:50:41.110 --> 04:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
know would only be from the point when
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
they can start doing
 
04:50:47.948 --> 04:50:47.958 align:start position:0%
that follow up so in that case defining
 
04:50:50.070 --> 04:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
what mandatory it has to come from the
 
04:50:53.948 --> 04:50:53.958 align:start position:0%
employee and the employer and the need
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the hour is that something that can
 
04:51:00.510 --> 04:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
be uh kind of
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
defined I
 
04:51:02.760 --> 04:51:04.390 align:start position:0%
defined I
I

04:51:04.390 --> 04:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
might refer back to the sponsor on the
 
04:51:08.350 --> 04:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill but you know as
 
04:51:10.590 --> 04:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
defined by the employer is pretty broad
 
04:51:14.350 --> 04:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have criteria in which to to
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
make that determination it's just you
 
04:51:19.788 --> 04:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
know the the you know uh proper body for
 
04:51:22.030 --> 04:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
that employer making that determination
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
based on whatever facts they want to
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
factor into it so so it is you know I I
 
04:51:29.070 --> 04:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see anything in the bill
 
04:51:32.070 --> 04:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
now that has a checklist or steps to
 
04:51:35.070 --> 04:51:35.080 align:start position:0%
Define what's mandatory it's
 
04:51:35.080 --> 04:51:37.948 align:start position:0%
Define what's mandatory it's
you

04:51:37.948 --> 04:51:37.958 align:start position:0%

firefighters in New Hampshire uh thank

04:52:23.628 --> 04:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
thank representative Maguire for

bringing this forward uh I really
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
appreciated uh the time in the
 
04:52:30.548 --> 04:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
commission working alongside her on this
 
04:52:32.510 --> 04:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
um the reason why the professional
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
firefighters think that this is is
 
04:52:37.230 --> 04:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
important is um you know I've heard it a
 
04:52:38.910 --> 04:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
couple times already the Recruitment and
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
Retention issue in our state is not
 
04:52:42.948 --> 04:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
getting better um and we need to find
 
04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
creative ways to move forward on this
 
04:52:49.628 --> 04:52:49.638 align:start position:0%
issue uh this is not this is not a a
 
04:52:52.230 --> 04:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
restoration of a benefit from the past
 
04:52:56.708 --> 04:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
although um at one at one point overtime
 
04:52:58.910 --> 04:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
was considered base compensation and it
 
04:53:01.150 --> 04:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
was all included in your base
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
calculation um this is a modif
 
04:53:06.990 --> 04:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh restoration if you will in that we're
 
04:53:10.430 --> 04:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
not asking for every Stitch of overtime
 
04:53:12.830 --> 04:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
to be included back into base
 
04:53:14.590 --> 04:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
compensation we're trying to be
 
04:53:18.030 --> 04:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
realistic with with the ask here in that
 
04:53:19.910 --> 04:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
um you know a firefighter a police
 
04:53:23.708 --> 04:53:23.718 align:start position:0%
officer a correctional officer um you
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
know if they're required to be at work
 
04:53:28.270 --> 04:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't then be penalized on the
 
04:53:30.788 --> 04:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
back end for that um and that's our
 
04:53:33.270 --> 04:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
position on this and just to to give you
 
04:53:33.280 --> 04:53:34.230 align:start position:0%
position on this and just to to give you
an

04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
example uh a firefighter wakes up ill on
 
04:53:39.990 --> 04:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
Christmas morning and can't come to work
 
04:53:42.150 --> 04:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
and another firefighter then has to stay
 
04:53:44.948 --> 04:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
and is unable to go home to their
 
04:53:48.190 --> 04:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
families um they're required to stay and
 
04:53:51.030 --> 04:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
then they're they retirement calculation
 
04:53:52.910 --> 04:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
suffers because of that now I understand
 
04:53:55.628 --> 04:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
that's it's a minor it's a minor
 
04:53:57.788 --> 04:53:57.798 align:start position:0%
one-time situation but this happens on
 
04:54:00.270 --> 04:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
nights weekends holidays this is time
 
04:54:02.628 --> 04:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
away from families uh this is forced
 
04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
time on the job and it's hours worked
 
04:54:07.868 --> 04:54:07.878 align:start position:0%
most of all uh it is actual hours worked
 
04:54:10.190 --> 04:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
on the job uh that they should be
 
04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
compensated for so I would ask for the
 
04:54:14.830 --> 04:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
committee's support uh at looking into
 
04:54:16.310 --> 04:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
this further and I'd be happy to answer
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
any questions uh representative Schmidt
 
04:54:21.070 --> 04:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
and then representative Mony you ready
 
04:54:24.910 --> 04:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
Brian I'm ready thank you Mr chairman
 
04:54:28.910 --> 04:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
so in a sense this is mandatory over
 
04:54:30.750 --> 04:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
time in the examples some of the
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
examples you gave for sure um
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
is would that be something that could be
 
04:54:40.150 --> 04:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
worked into this bill because if if you
 
04:54:42.070 --> 04:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
got to stay on the job you got to stay
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
on the job because Public Safety is
 
04:54:46.708 --> 04:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
involved especially in the case of
 
04:54:50.070 --> 04:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
Troopers uh then they should be they
 
04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
should be wouldn't be penalized for that
 
04:54:56.190 --> 04:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
so is that something you would uh
 
04:54:59.070 --> 04:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
entertain if uh the if it were
 
04:55:01.750 --> 04:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
workable representative I'm sorry I
 
04:55:03.510 --> 04:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
guess I missed the question there
 
04:55:05.590 --> 04:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
talking about holidays specifically I'm
 
04:55:09.030 --> 04:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
talking about anytime a trooper is is on
 
04:55:12.910 --> 04:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
D on duty and cannot leave I see because
 
04:55:15.430 --> 04:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
the the scene of the accident just think
 
04:55:16.948 --> 04:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
in the winter time you got a hor
 
04:55:19.030 --> 04:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
horrific accident those Troopers are
 
04:55:22.030 --> 04:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
going to stay until the job is done sure
 
04:55:24.310 --> 04:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
um yes I that's mandatory they didn't
 
04:55:26.830 --> 04:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
get an option anybody here want to work
 
04:55:28.670 --> 04:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
overtime you know in a factory or
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
something like that they got to stay so
 
04:55:35.030 --> 04:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't that be part of the the
 
04:55:38.830 --> 04:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
the out reach of this
 
04:55:41.750 --> 04:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
Bill yes I would be supportive of that I
 
04:55:44.590 --> 04:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
I think um you know I don't want to get
 
04:55:47.270 --> 04:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
too too much into the weeds because I
 
04:55:50.350 --> 04:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
think that the defining of mandatory
 
04:55:50.360 --> 04:55:52.230 align:start position:0%
think that the defining of mandatory
overtime

04:55:52.230 --> 04:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
overtime
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
removes uh being in the business myself
 
04:55:57.788 --> 04:55:57.798 align:start position:0%
it REM removes a lot of the ambiguity
 
04:56:00.070 --> 04:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
whether that be through uh as mentioned
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
by Mr Carlin earlier Department policy
 
04:56:05.670 --> 04:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
Department procedure U the fire chiefs
 
04:56:08.310 --> 04:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
making that determination um collective
 
04:56:11.868 --> 04:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements uh in many cases
 
04:56:14.708 --> 04:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
the the city or town identifies what
 
04:56:17.548 --> 04:56:17.558 align:start position:0%
that Staffing model looks like and
 
04:56:19.628 --> 04:56:19.638 align:start position:0%
requires you to maintain a minimum
 
04:56:22.990 --> 04:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
Staffing um so in in different
 
04:56:26.110 --> 04:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities it may vary as to what is
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
uh what they're defining mandatory um
 
04:56:30.190 --> 04:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
but that's what we're trying to do here
 
04:56:32.750 --> 04:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
is is be consistent within those
 
04:56:32.760 --> 04:56:34.070 align:start position:0%
is is be consistent within those
municipalities

04:56:34.070 --> 04:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:56:36.270 --> 04:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
ities representative
 
04:56:38.708 --> 04:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
mrai thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:56:42.310 --> 04:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you kind of partly
 
04:56:44.590 --> 04:56:44.600 align:start position:0%
answered my question in terms of
 
04:56:47.070 --> 04:56:47.080 align:start position:0%
mandatory because it's the need and this
 
04:56:50.910 --> 04:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
will also provide the workforce that's
 
04:56:50.920 --> 04:56:52.310 align:start position:0%
will also provide the workforce that's
needed

04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:56:55.548 --> 04:56:55.558 align:start position:0%
today if you don't have five
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
firefighters to serve in the community
 
04:57:01.868 --> 04:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
today one of the firefighters have to do
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
an overtime to fill in the
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
fourth um position right
 
04:57:13.750 --> 04:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
so H how do you define that in and you
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
kind of said it goes from Community to
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
community it gets the municipality what
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
they set the standard so in from that
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
point with the concern of not being able
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
to higher retain would this uh add to
 
04:57:35.070 --> 04:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
the toolbox of Workforce Force retention
 
04:57:37.628 --> 04:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
and providing
 
04:57:41.310 --> 04:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
adequate Workforce for today's need
 
04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I I can't
 
04:57:45.470 --> 04:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
say with any amount of certainty but I
 
04:57:47.190 --> 04:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
do believe that it is a piece of the
 
04:57:49.708 --> 04:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
puzzle um and it's a piece that when we
 
04:57:54.150 --> 04:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
look at what we believe to be um the the
 
04:57:56.470 --> 04:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
lowest hanging fruit that it makes the
 
04:57:58.470 --> 04:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
most sense this is truly a fairness
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
issue and when we talk about the
 
04:58:03.830 --> 04:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
inability to go home and and live our
 
04:58:06.708 --> 04:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
regular lives because we we swore an
 
04:58:08.830 --> 04:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
oath we we have an obligation to protect
 
04:58:11.708 --> 04:58:11.718 align:start position:0%
our communities um and and we take that
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
very seriously but also we do have lives
 
04:58:17.190 --> 04:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
too and we have families um and we have
 
04:58:19.190 --> 04:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
other obligations that we're not able to
 
04:58:22.110 --> 04:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
attend to because we're being forced to
 
04:58:23.350 --> 04:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
be held and if I could give you an
 
04:58:25.948 --> 04:58:25.958 align:start position:0%
example just as a way this may work
 
04:58:28.708 --> 04:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
right in the community I work in we
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
staff at 15 firefighters per shift the
 
04:58:34.708 --> 04:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
fire chief has determined that the
 
04:58:38.270 --> 04:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
minimum Staffing for the fire department
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
is 13 firefighters so if two
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
firefighters take the day off no harm no
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
foul no one has no one's mandatory
 
04:58:49.548 --> 04:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
forced into work um if a third
 
04:58:51.470 --> 04:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
firefighter takes the day off the same
 
04:58:54.070 --> 04:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
day then someone needs to fill that seat
 
04:58:56.628 --> 04:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
they've determined that 13 firefighters
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
is the lowest minimum Staffing standard
 
04:59:02.788 --> 04:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
um to maintain a safe work environment
 
04:59:04.868 --> 04:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
for our firefighters so that's what the
 
04:59:08.070 --> 04:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
fire chief has determined as being um
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
the the safest Staffing model it doesn't
 
04:59:12.390 --> 04:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
work that way in every Community but
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
that's why it's so important to
 
04:59:19.230 --> 04:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
allow it to be defined by the
 
04:59:22.470 --> 04:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
department representative
 
04:59:26.548 --> 04:59:26.558 align:start position:0%
gr hi Mr Dr I support the fairness issue
 
04:59:29.910 --> 04:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
and in principle I support the bill my
 
04:59:31.708 --> 04:59:31.718 align:start position:0%
my I just would like to
 
04:59:36.628 --> 04:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
know is there a way of further defining
 
04:59:39.230 --> 04:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
what mandatory when you speak about it
 
04:59:40.830 --> 04:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
it makes sense right
 
04:59:43.350 --> 04:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
somebody it doesn't come to work so the
 
04:59:44.948 --> 04:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
person that's working on the night shift
 
04:59:46.548 --> 04:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
or the day shift or whatever shift it
 
04:59:48.788 --> 04:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
was has to cover for that other
 
04:59:48.798 --> 04:59:51.548 align:start position:0%
was has to cover for that other
shift

04:59:51.548 --> 04:59:51.558 align:start position:0%
shift
 
04:59:54.430 --> 04:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
so is there a
 
04:59:56.868 --> 04:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
definition of what that
 
05:00:00.670 --> 05:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
is is that is you know my previous
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
example where somebody doesn't come to
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
work but there's two people that are
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
willing to fill that slot that's not
 
05:00:09.310 --> 05:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
really mandatory cons that's not
 
05:00:09.320 --> 05:00:10.990 align:start position:0%
really mandatory cons that's not
mandatory

05:00:10.990 --> 05:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
overtime because either one of them is
 
05:00:15.150 --> 05:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
willing to do
 
05:00:18.830 --> 05:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
it so can you help me understand that
 
05:00:22.230 --> 05:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
better or am I just picking at something
 
05:00:25.788 --> 05:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
that can't be defined further I guess
 
05:00:26.750 --> 05:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
05:00:31.310 --> 05:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
question my first my I guess my um
 
05:00:34.110 --> 05:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
hypothetical question would be
 
05:00:36.910 --> 05:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
would it matter um
 
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't matter if you have to
 
05:00:41.708 --> 05:00:41.718 align:start position:0%
pay employee a or employee B to fill
 
05:00:43.390 --> 05:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
that mandatory
 
05:00:47.350 --> 05:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
spot it's still going to cost a certain
 
05:00:48.990 --> 05:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
percentage right and it's going to
 
05:00:50.350 --> 05:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
calculates a certain percentage in
 
05:00:52.670 --> 05:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
someone's overtime um I guess the
 
05:00:54.230 --> 05:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
simplest way of putting it would be the
 
05:00:58.868 --> 05:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
example I just gave and that a um
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
however it's determined whether it be
 
05:01:04.470 --> 05:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
through uh Collective bargaining or city
 
05:01:07.150 --> 05:01:07.160 align:start position:0%
policy or the fire chief's management
 
05:01:09.510 --> 05:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
rights there is a minimum Staffing
 
05:01:11.788 --> 05:01:11.798 align:start position:0%
standard uh for every Department that
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
must be maintained and to me the
 
05:01:18.190 --> 05:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
simplest way of putting it is if it
 
05:01:20.230 --> 05:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
falls below that then that would be
 
05:01:23.590 --> 05:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory over time followup thank you I
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
think i' with your help on that
 
05:01:30.230 --> 05:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
and so really in this case the employer
 
05:01:31.350 --> 05:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
could be a
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
municipality correct so they're going to
 
05:01:35.868 --> 05:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
determine for themselves through their
 
05:01:38.110 --> 05:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements with
 
05:01:41.350 --> 05:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
their with their um employers or EMP
 
05:01:42.750 --> 05:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
employees how this is going to be
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
managed so thank you I think I I'm
 
05:01:46.990 --> 05:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
settled sure I think I'm
 
05:01:51.110 --> 05:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative um
 
05:01:55.150 --> 05:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you Mr chairman um would you
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
be willing
 
05:01:59.788 --> 05:01:59.798 align:start position:0%
to the confusion about
 
05:01:59.798 --> 05:02:01.430 align:start position:0%
to the confusion about
mandatory

05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
05:02:04.948 --> 05:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
um over time would you be willing to
 
05:02:08.230 --> 05:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
submit an amendment that that gave a
 
05:02:10.628 --> 05:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
definition of mandatory overtime to be
 
05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
added add it to the bill I I would be
 
05:02:16.110 --> 05:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
happy to have those conversations I I
 
05:02:18.390 --> 05:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
would prefer to have that conversation
 
05:02:20.310 --> 05:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
with representative McGuire who who
 
05:02:22.948 --> 05:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
wrote the Bill and okay thank you um but
 
05:02:25.390 --> 05:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be opposed to to word
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
smithing it if that's what we need to do
 
05:02:31.628 --> 05:02:31.638 align:start position:0%
okay U representative gold thank you Mr
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank thank you for um taking
 
05:02:34.080 --> 05:02:35.430 align:start position:0%
chair and thank thank you for um taking
my

05:02:35.430 --> 05:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:02:37.830 --> 05:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
question your previous statement
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
response to representative Grody was
 
05:02:42.110 --> 05:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
also very helpful to me and to to me one
 
05:02:44.590 --> 05:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
of the things that jumped out was the
 
05:02:48.270 --> 05:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
mandatory nature is based on the need of
 
05:02:51.788 --> 05:02:51.798 align:start position:0%
the opening that exists so it the
 
05:02:54.830 --> 05:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
mandatory is attached to the position if
 
05:02:57.150 --> 05:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
a volunteer happens to be available to
 
05:02:58.948 --> 05:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
volunteer to do that they're filling a
 
05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
mandatory need and if nobody
 
05:03:05.470 --> 05:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
volunteers then somebody's going to
 
05:03:08.708 --> 05:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
appoint a body to do it to fill a
 
05:03:11.310 --> 05:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory need so I'm wondering if that
 
05:03:13.230 --> 05:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
might be a consideration to put into the
 
05:03:17.150 --> 05:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
rewarding somehow that the mandat and as
 
05:03:19.868 --> 05:03:19.878 align:start position:0%
you pointed out you can't write a
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
definition that's going to fit every
 
05:03:24.150 --> 05:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
single instance because you have so many
 
05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
different you know whether it's a
 
05:03:26.948 --> 05:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
residential program that has to be
 
05:03:30.030 --> 05:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
staffed 247 a hospital a fire department
 
05:03:33.190 --> 05:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
there a municipality a state run
 
05:03:35.948 --> 05:03:35.958 align:start position:0%
um they all have
 
05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
different probably
 
05:03:41.230 --> 05:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
definitions does that make sense yes
 
05:03:42.670 --> 05:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative it makes sense
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
to me and and I think that um you know
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
you hit the nail on the head and in that
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's a mandatory need um and that that
 
05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be defined differently in
 
05:03:55.510 --> 05:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
every single City and town and in every
 
05:03:57.990 --> 05:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
single discipline whether be fire police
 
05:04:02.190 --> 05:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
the hospitals whatever um at some point
 
05:04:05.548 --> 05:04:05.558 align:start position:0%
it is defined somewhere as to what a
 
05:04:09.548 --> 05:04:09.558 align:start position:0%
minimum level of acceptable Staffing is
 
05:04:11.310 --> 05:04:11.320 align:start position:0%
Right otherwise you could potentially
 
05:04:13.390 --> 05:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
have a fire department with two people
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
working um when they're supposed to have
 
05:04:19.788 --> 05:04:19.798 align:start position:0%
15 so um certainly we can we
 
05:04:22.350 --> 05:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
can we could work on some language if
 
05:04:26.390 --> 05:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:30.190 --> 05:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay see none thank you and
 
05:04:42.150 --> 05:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%

well as the New Hampshire Troopers

Association I expect and and and that's
 
05:04:57.990 --> 05:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's at least my goal uh that this is
 
05:05:00.430 --> 05:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
the shortest testimony you hear all day
 
05:05:03.190 --> 05:05:03.200 align:start position:0%

05:05:22.750 --> 05:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
issue and they strongly support House

encompasses the town of
 
05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
dairy as this is something that
 
05:05:55.548 --> 05:05:55.558 align:start position:0%
is uh will affect my operations As A
 
05:05:56.590 --> 05:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
Firefighter in New Hampshire I'll

retirement
 
05:06:03.868 --> 05:06:03.878 align:start position:0%
system so listening to the testimony and
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
the questions that were
 
05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:12.350 --> 05:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
as you know the language of the bill let
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
let me bring it as I have with other
 
05:06:16.470 --> 05:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
things to to just you know where the
 
05:06:19.470 --> 05:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
rubber meets the road here right so you
 
05:06:22.150 --> 05:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
have a situation where in a lot of
 
05:06:25.350 --> 05:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
communities you have a staffing level
 
05:06:27.548 --> 05:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
and as as Mr real estated in in
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
Portsmith the way they do it where they
 
05:06:30.510 --> 05:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
can go down
 
05:06:36.750 --> 05:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
too now to to muddy the the the blanket
 
05:06:38.548 --> 05:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
definition part of this a little bit
 
05:06:40.430 --> 05:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
more right so the city of Manchester is
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
required to have
 
05:06:42.240 --> 05:06:43.868 align:start position:0%
required to have
46

05:06:43.868 --> 05:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
46
 
05:06:48.030 --> 05:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
46 so you have a sometimes the threshold
 
05:06:50.750 --> 05:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
there is a lot greater is you have the
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
ability to have at any one time 16
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
people off on a
 
05:07:02.470 --> 05:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
shift 16 so I I've been there 21 years I
 
05:07:05.548 --> 05:07:05.558 align:start position:0%
have been forced to work at 21 years on
 
05:07:06.788 --> 05:07:06.798 align:start position:0%
a mandatory
 
05:07:08.910 --> 05:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
shift what that so what does that mean
 
05:07:10.910 --> 05:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
right that means that I didn't go
 
05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
home or didn't get to come to conquer to
 
05:07:15.510 --> 05:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
go to my niece's birthday
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
party almost missed a flight
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
once mandatory
 
05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
overtime and as I have stated in the
 
05:07:26.670 --> 05:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
testimony in the other Overtime
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
Bill this is doing the same work on
 
05:07:32.310 --> 05:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
Tuesday that I'm doing on Wednesday in
 
05:07:34.390 --> 05:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
and yet you're treating the exact same
 
05:07:37.030 --> 05:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
amount of work differently except in
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
this case a governmental
 
05:07:44.310 --> 05:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
agency is telling me I have to stay at
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
work or there are
 
05:07:50.788 --> 05:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
penalties this is not a
 
05:07:52.910 --> 05:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
simple you don't get to go home let's
 
05:07:54.948 --> 05:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
look at what this really is but when
 
05:07:56.830 --> 05:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
you're forcing someone to work you are
 
05:07:58.830 --> 05:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
doing it against their
 
05:08:01.470 --> 05:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
will and I want that I want that to sink
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
in here
 
05:08:06.190 --> 05:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
okay there a governmental agency forcing
 
05:08:10.708 --> 05:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
a person under penalty of discipline or
 
05:08:14.628 --> 05:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
the loss of a job that they must
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
stay and I think that that changes this
 
05:08:19.150 --> 05:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
game tremendously when you're talking
 
05:08:19.160 --> 05:08:21.910 align:start position:0%
game tremendously when you're talking
about

05:08:21.910 --> 05:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
that and it's certainly why at a minimum
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
05:08:31.350 --> 05:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
treated like any other shift as far as
 
05:08:34.310 --> 05:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
the calculations go now this isn't free
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
the employee and the employer pay their
 
05:08:38.470 --> 05:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
portion as they would for the shift the
 
05:08:38.480 --> 05:08:39.190 align:start position:0%
portion as they would for the shift the
day

05:08:39.190 --> 05:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
before so this isn't coming out of
 
05:08:42.788 --> 05:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
there's no magical pot of money this has
 
05:08:45.390 --> 05:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
to come out of this is this is coming
 
05:08:47.708 --> 05:08:47.718 align:start position:0%
right out of the checks as it was
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
before so I want to I want to make sure
 
05:08:52.430 --> 05:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
we understand that as well this as far
 
05:08:55.070 --> 05:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
as as far as that aspect
 
05:08:58.270 --> 05:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
goes now as far as the the requests for
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
kind of an overall blanket definition of
 
05:09:01.120 --> 05:09:02.708 align:start position:0%
kind of an overall blanket definition of
this

05:09:02.708 --> 05:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:09:04.510 --> 05:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
I think we got to be careful here
 
05:09:06.430 --> 05:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
because I as a person who believes in
 
05:09:06.440 --> 05:09:07.390 align:start position:0%
because I as a person who believes in
local

05:09:07.390 --> 05:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
local
 
05:09:11.788 --> 05:09:11.798 align:start position:0%
control as I do if we start to mess with
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
the local control aspect of this we're
 
05:09:16.708 --> 05:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
going to run into a situation where we
 
05:09:20.590 --> 05:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
have a definition that does not work for
 
05:09:23.430 --> 05:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
everybody where as an
 
05:09:26.670 --> 05:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
example in the case of Mr Real's
 
05:09:28.470 --> 05:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
Department en pouth they can go down two
 
05:09:30.430 --> 05:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
people before they have to hire my
 
05:09:33.310 --> 05:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
department can't go down anybody
 
05:09:35.350 --> 05:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
except that we have units in the city of
 
05:09:36.948 --> 05:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
Manchester that are required to be
 
05:09:40.150 --> 05:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
filled and we have units in Manchester
 
05:09:41.788 --> 05:09:41.798 align:start position:0%
fire that are
 
05:09:44.350 --> 05:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
not required to be filled we have a
 
05:09:48.390 --> 05:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
squad unit that is not required to be
 
05:09:50.110 --> 05:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
staffed so we're going to have to be
 
05:09:52.390 --> 05:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
careful here if we decide to do a
 
05:09:54.230 --> 05:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
blanket definition Statewide and take
 
05:09:55.470 --> 05:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
away local
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
control that we're not either forcing a
 
05:09:59.708 --> 05:09:59.718 align:start position:0%
municipality into something they don't
 
05:10:00.548 --> 05:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:10:03.830 --> 05:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
do from from the sake of of having to
 
05:10:06.990 --> 05:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
retain people or we're forcing a
 
05:10:09.990 --> 05:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
municipality to
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
not keep someone that and that's I think
 
05:10:16.390 --> 05:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
the local control aspect of this is is
 
05:10:18.110 --> 05:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
is a critical part here and that's just
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
the fire service wise I can't speak for
 
05:10:22.030 --> 05:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
how Corrections in in law enforcement
 
05:10:25.390 --> 05:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
operate but you know we have communities
 
05:10:26.548 --> 05:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
have different needs they have different
 
05:10:27.708 --> 05:10:27.718 align:start position:0%
Staffing levels they have different
 
05:10:28.948 --> 05:10:28.958 align:start position:0%
philosophies they have different
 
05:10:30.948 --> 05:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
tolerances some I can tell you a
 
05:10:32.590 --> 05:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
volunteer department that I worked
 
05:10:36.948 --> 05:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
perdum for 20 years ago if they had if
 
05:10:38.430 --> 05:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
no one showed up that day they just rent
 
05:10:41.350 --> 05:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
went with nobody it would anybody which
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
was a little shocking to some of the
 
05:10:45.670 --> 05:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
residents there but that was reality so
 
05:10:47.150 --> 05:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
where does that fall into play now are
 
05:10:51.070 --> 05:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
you forcing this town to create a a
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum that they they just
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
currently don't have so I just urg
 
05:10:57.590 --> 05:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
caution when it comes to the blanket
 
05:10:59.788 --> 05:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
definition o of what this would be as
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
far as local control goes
 
05:11:05.150 --> 05:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing I want to remind the
 
05:11:07.230 --> 05:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
committee here is that overtime because
 
05:11:08.670 --> 05:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
of the way our salary and benefit
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
structures now work overtime saves
 
05:11:10.718 --> 05:11:12.190 align:start position:0%
structures now work overtime saves
municipalities

05:11:12.190 --> 05:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
05:11:14.430 --> 05:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
money because they're not paying which
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
is now mostly 60% of someone's
 
05:11:18.910 --> 05:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
compensation packages benefits you don't
 
05:11:21.948 --> 05:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
get extra Dental for showing up on on an
 
05:11:24.708 --> 05:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
overtime shift
 
05:11:27.350 --> 05:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
so let's not lose sight of that that
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
that game has changed a little bit here
 
05:11:30.868 --> 05:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
and where we have municipalities right
 
05:11:34.548 --> 05:11:34.558 align:start position:0%
now that are running short to save
 
05:11:37.470 --> 05:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
money they are slightly exacerbating the
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
potential of of mandatory overtime
 
05:11:41.110 --> 05:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
shifts now as far as Recruitment and
 
05:11:43.430 --> 05:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
Retention goes we had a an individual
 
05:11:45.868 --> 05:11:45.878 align:start position:0%
who was hired by Manchester fire who
 
05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
quit after his first shift because he
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
was getting held mandatory and had a
 
05:11:53.030 --> 05:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
newborn now I think it was probably a
 
05:11:54.470 --> 05:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of a failure to explain to
 
05:11:57.430 --> 05:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
that individual that the magnitude of
 
05:11:59.350 --> 05:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
what a mandatory overtime shift is and
 
05:12:00.670 --> 05:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that he would be subject to
 
05:12:02.548 --> 05:12:02.558 align:start position:0%
that but the point is we lost an
 
05:12:05.708 --> 05:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:10.390 --> 05:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
this so where where we are so scarce and
 
05:12:13.788 --> 05:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
so desperate for human resources right
 
05:12:16.510 --> 05:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
now to get into a situation where you
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
enter into employment in New Hampshire
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
and emergency services and you live in
 
05:12:20.548 --> 05:12:20.558 align:start position:0%
the world of potential mandatory
 
05:12:22.868 --> 05:12:22.878 align:start position:0%
overtime but oh by the way we're not
 
05:12:25.190 --> 05:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
going to compensate you the same way for
 
05:12:27.628 --> 05:12:27.638 align:start position:0%
this forced action that we will for the
 
05:12:29.190 --> 05:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
shift that you had the day
 
05:12:31.110 --> 05:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
before you can see where that's going to
 
05:12:32.830 --> 05:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
be a little problem atic and it costs us
 
05:12:32.840 --> 05:12:33.708 align:start position:0%
be a little problem atic and it costs us
an

05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
employee the concept of it costs us an
 
05:12:38.548 --> 05:12:38.558 align:start position:0%
employee so that that's where I'm going
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
with this and and I just I just hope
 
05:12:42.190 --> 05:12:42.200 align:start position:0%
that those factors can be taken into
 
05:12:45.030 --> 05:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
consideration when drafting the
 
05:12:47.390 --> 05:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
parameters that you're you seem to be
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
asking for I have one question for
 
05:12:50.910 --> 05:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
clarification then uh representative
 
05:12:53.708 --> 05:12:53.718 align:start position:0%
Schmidt um so if you have a department
 
05:12:56.190 --> 05:12:56.200 align:start position:0%
that's trying to save money by having
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
fewer employees but more
 
05:13:00.830 --> 05:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
overtime um I mean is it that something
 
05:13:02.510 --> 05:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's scheduled ahead of time and
 
05:13:03.548 --> 05:13:03.558 align:start position:0%
people know they're going to have to do
 
05:13:05.628 --> 05:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
it so it's not mandatory over time or is
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
it handled as mandatory over time that
 
05:13:09.310 --> 05:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
would depend on the department I I can
 
05:13:11.190 --> 05:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
there are there are cases I'm I'm not
 
05:13:12.590 --> 05:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with every single Department in
 
05:13:14.750 --> 05:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
the state at all not even close but I
 
05:13:16.948 --> 05:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
know of cases where the the handling of
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
of mandatory overtime is very different
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
from Department to Department okay so
 
05:13:23.708 --> 05:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
there's there is no blanket process or
 
05:13:26.270 --> 05:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
way that that's conducted representative
 
05:13:30.350 --> 05:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
schmi thank you Mr chairman uh so I I'm
 
05:13:32.708 --> 05:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
as strong an advocate as you are for
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
local control and you mentioned this in
 
05:13:37.670 --> 05:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
your testimony a couple days ago if you
 
05:13:41.110 --> 05:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
recall one day you're working this
 
05:13:42.788 --> 05:13:42.798 align:start position:0%
category the next day you're doing the
 
05:13:45.750 --> 05:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
same job but it's different category but
 
05:13:47.788 --> 05:13:47.798 align:start position:0%
the the reality is that it's kind of a
 
05:13:50.788 --> 05:13:50.798 align:start position:0%
doggy dog world out there where one town
 
05:13:53.110 --> 05:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
is picking off employees from anywhere
 
05:13:55.390 --> 05:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
else to get them because they need them
 
05:13:57.070 --> 05:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh and they're they're making a better
 
05:13:59.310 --> 05:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
offer to that employee for whatever re
 
05:14:00.390 --> 05:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
reason whether it's because it's a
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
shorter commute or better better pay
 
05:14:06.990 --> 05:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
whatever um but to the degree that that
 
05:14:09.868 --> 05:14:09.878 align:start position:0%
the mandatory overtime would be
 
05:14:11.868 --> 05:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
different would work out differently in
 
05:14:14.670 --> 05:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
town a than Town B Because town a is
 
05:14:18.070 --> 05:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
paying more generous basis of whatever
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
then Town B is well that's the luck of
 
05:14:23.670 --> 05:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
the draw and in terms of town a having
 
05:14:26.510 --> 05:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
that situation and town B not having it
 
05:14:31.510 --> 05:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
or vice versa so why is that necessarily
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
I I understand that there's lots of
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
complexities here um and it's kind of
 
05:14:39.350 --> 05:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
like you know uh I don't have to give
 
05:14:42.750 --> 05:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
you examples you understand uh why is it
 
05:14:48.070 --> 05:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily a a a deal breaker uh to go
 
05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
for mandatory overtime where it's going
 
05:14:52.548 --> 05:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
to work out differently in some of the
 
05:14:54.628 --> 05:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
towns and others sure in the case of of
 
05:14:56.310 --> 05:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
the individual that we lost in
 
05:14:58.430 --> 05:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh his boots landed on a
 
05:15:00.430 --> 05:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
department that didn't have it right
 
05:15:01.990 --> 05:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
they just didn't do it they ran they ran
 
05:15:04.270 --> 05:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
down to zero MH which does not serve the
 
05:15:05.788 --> 05:15:05.798 align:start position:0%
public I in my opinion does not serve
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
the public in any way but you know
 
05:15:10.070 --> 05:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
people's life situations are very
 
05:15:11.310 --> 05:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
different some people have a lot of
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
flexibility some do not where we have we
 
05:15:16.548 --> 05:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
have a department in the state where a
 
05:15:18.270 --> 05:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
mandatory overtime could be traded off
 
05:15:20.830 --> 05:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
to someone that is not my department my
 
05:15:24.670 --> 05:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
department does not allow that so you
 
05:15:27.670 --> 05:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
know in the in the whole crusp of local
 
05:15:29.788 --> 05:15:29.798 align:start position:0%
control right we don't have a standard
 
05:15:32.070 --> 05:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
pay for a police officer New Hampshire
 
05:15:33.868 --> 05:15:33.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities determine that pay we
 
05:15:35.110 --> 05:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
don't have a standard pay for a teacher
 
05:15:38.510 --> 05:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have standard pay right for for
 
05:15:41.430 --> 05:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
any local entity those conditions are
 
05:15:43.708 --> 05:15:43.718 align:start position:0%
set by the municipalities and they
 
05:15:45.350 --> 05:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
battle it out for human resources and
 
05:15:47.868 --> 05:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
Duke it out for the limited limited
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
folks that unfortunately we have today
 
05:15:51.868 --> 05:15:51.878 align:start position:0%
so again the maintaining of local
 
05:15:54.110 --> 05:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
control in this regard is is no
 
05:15:56.948 --> 05:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
different that the they can set a a
 
05:15:59.628 --> 05:15:59.638 align:start position:0%
situation that can attract or not
 
05:16:03.628 --> 05:16:03.638 align:start position:0%
attract an employee so like I said I'm
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
just urging urging caution if we're
 
05:16:07.708 --> 05:16:07.718 align:start position:0%
trying to have a
 
05:16:07.718 --> 05:16:09.628 align:start position:0%
trying to have a
Statewide

05:16:09.628 --> 05:16:09.638 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
05:16:12.030 --> 05:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
definition in taking that away from
 
05:16:12.040 --> 05:16:13.310 align:start position:0%
definition in taking that away from
local

05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
local
 
05:16:15.628 --> 05:16:15.638 align:start position:0%
control any other
 
05:16:18.310 --> 05:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
questions okay see none thank you Mr
 
05:16:20.590 --> 05:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
chair is there anyone else here who want
 
05:16:24.390 --> 05:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:26.910 --> 05:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
1451 okay seeing none I'm going to close
 
05:16:30.910 --> 05:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing on that and I uh hang on are
 
05:16:32.590 --> 05:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
is the chair coming back up or are you
 
05:16:34.110 --> 05:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
stand out
 
05:16:38.470 --> 05:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
there okay um all right so you're still
 
05:16:40.670 --> 05:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
okay with the
 
05:16:44.470 --> 05:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
execu what she are you saying that we
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
session yeah one two three four five six
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:00.400 --> 05:17:07.310 align:start position:0%
 
without

05:17:07.310 --> 05:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:07.320 --> 05:17:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
all

05:17:09.270 --> 05:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:17:11.548 --> 05:17:11.558 align:start position:0%
right what's
 
05:17:11.558 --> 05:17:13.830 align:start position:0%
right what's
up

05:17:13.830 --> 05:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:17:16.628 --> 05:17:16.638 align:start position:0%
fine all right we've had a request to go
 
05:17:19.190 --> 05:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
into executive
 
05:17:21.750 --> 05:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
session is there a
 
05:17:25.070 --> 05:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
motion yes Madam chair I move um
 
05:17:29.190 --> 05:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:32.110 --> 05:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
1451 all right represent do you wish to
 
05:17:34.830 --> 05:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes I apologize to
 
05:17:37.868 --> 05:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
the committee if I took us down the um
 
05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
lost path of Def finding mandatory um
 
05:17:45.430 --> 05:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
overtime but I think that the testimony
 
05:17:48.390 --> 05:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
that we heard after that helped me um
 
05:17:50.230 --> 05:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
come to the conclusion that really the
 
05:17:52.150 --> 05:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities are the employers and the
 
05:17:54.430 --> 05:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
ones who are who are going to be
 
05:17:56.510 --> 05:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for this and that is their
 
05:18:00.310 --> 05:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
decision and therefore it should remain
 
05:18:00.320 --> 05:18:01.910 align:start position:0%
decision and therefore it should remain
there

05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:18:04.350 --> 05:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
representative gold did you we to speak
 
05:18:07.310 --> 05:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
to your second uh no I I totally agree
 
05:18:09.910 --> 05:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
with what representative Grody has
 
05:18:14.470 --> 05:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
said representative leus thank you um I
 
05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
think I'll support the OTP but yeah
 
05:18:19.510 --> 05:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns
 
05:18:22.628 --> 05:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
that while in one sense the local
 
05:18:25.350 --> 05:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
employers uh are responsible the money's
 
05:18:28.990 --> 05:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pension fund and that
 
05:18:32.750 --> 05:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be paid for by all employers
 
05:18:34.750 --> 05:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
um and although as was mentioned there
 
05:18:36.788 --> 05:18:36.798 align:start position:0%
was a mention that the money's already
 
05:18:38.430 --> 05:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
being paid because they're paying on
 
05:18:41.030 --> 05:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
overtime the reality though is in a fact
 
05:18:43.430 --> 05:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a donation to the pension
 
05:18:46.430 --> 05:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
system because uh benefits aren't paid
 
05:18:48.150 --> 05:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
on that you could say that's not just
 
05:18:50.708 --> 05:18:50.718 align:start position:0%
and it should be fixed and I might agree
 
05:18:53.230 --> 05:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
with that but it's still going to be an
 
05:18:55.350 --> 05:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
additional cost that we're putting on uh
 
05:18:58.270 --> 05:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
the employers so I'm not entirely happy
 
05:19:00.788 --> 05:19:00.798 align:start position:0%
but um and little concerned about 28a
 
05:19:03.548 --> 05:19:03.558 align:start position:0%
issues but I think I can go along with
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
it yes all right and anyone
 
05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
else I I would agree that trying to
 
05:19:12.240 --> 05:19:14.110 align:start position:0%
else I I would agree that trying to
Define

05:19:14.110 --> 05:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
Define
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
mandatory would be an exercise in
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
futility because each employer would
 
05:19:22.670 --> 05:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
have different ideas of what is
 
05:19:25.390 --> 05:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
mandatory over time some of it is I'm
 
05:19:27.628 --> 05:19:27.638 align:start position:0%
sure is decided by cor collective
 
05:19:29.070 --> 05:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining but
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.708 --> 05:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
be right and that's why this or one of
 
05:19:41.788 --> 05:19:41.798 align:start position:0%
the reasons this bill explicitly says
 
05:19:44.670 --> 05:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
it's the employer call on what's
 
05:19:46.868 --> 05:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
mandatory because they they know the
 
05:19:48.750 --> 05:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
conditions that's in and they know that
 
05:19:53.030 --> 05:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:57.548 --> 05:19:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:02.510 --> 05:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
else represent leus you have a
 
05:20:04.548 --> 05:20:04.558 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
05:20:07.150 --> 05:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
questions that case not per the motion
 
05:20:09.788 --> 05:20:09.798 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass by representative groa
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
and the clerk can call the
 
05:20:14.868 --> 05:20:14.878 align:start position:0%

it on
 
05:21:03.270 --> 05:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
consent and thank you all for for
 
05:21:06.230 --> 05:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
participating and close the executive
 
05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:30.040 --> 05:26:01.788 align:start position:0%
 
subcommittees

05:26:01.788 --> 05:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:04.310 --> 05:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's actually kind of hard to hear from
 
05:26:07.510 --> 05:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
here up to the other end of the room so
 
05:26:09.788 --> 05:26:09.798 align:start position:0%
and it's a little
 
05:26:12.548 --> 05:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
friendlier um all right we had thought
 
05:26:13.750 --> 05:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
we were
 
05:26:17.070 --> 05:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
going is this Lee Webster by any chance
 
05:26:19.788 --> 05:26:19.798 align:start position:0%
no that's a representative never mind we
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to hear from uh
 
05:26:24.350 --> 05:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
someone who was well-versed in this
 
05:26:28.708 --> 05:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
subject however uh they are not
 
05:26:32.670 --> 05:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:35.270 --> 05:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
some written testimony or email
 
05:26:40.430 --> 05:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
testimony uh yes I I do have
 
05:26:43.750 --> 05:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
clarifications that uh the prime sponsor
 
05:26:47.430 --> 05:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
um this representative lontine
 
05:26:49.948 --> 05:26:49.958 align:start position:0%
sent did everyone get
 
05:26:55.470 --> 05:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
that okay um I will state that um I
 
05:26:58.788 --> 05:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
believe there are still quite a few
 
05:27:02.670 --> 05:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
questions um revolving in around this
 
05:27:07.030 --> 05:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
issue and where a lot of your testimony
 
05:27:10.830 --> 05:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
previously and in in the submitted
 
05:27:13.788 --> 05:27:13.798 align:start position:0%
clarification refers to Green burials I
 
05:27:16.350 --> 05:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
will point out this is not technically
 
05:27:19.430 --> 05:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
green burials it's not alkaline
 
05:27:22.910 --> 05:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
hydrolysis green burials are in fact
 
05:27:26.670 --> 05:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
permitted by Statute now so this is
 
05:27:29.590 --> 05:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
technically a whole new concept that
 
05:27:32.830 --> 05:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:36.590 --> 05:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
um I I will say that for
 
05:27:40.390 --> 05:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
myself um I was kind
 
05:27:43.948 --> 05:27:43.958 align:start position:0%
of perplexed that the states that have
 
05:27:46.868 --> 05:27:46.878 align:start position:0%
adopted this have not been able to craft
 
05:27:49.990 --> 05:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
rules addressing regulating it yet and
 
05:27:52.788 --> 05:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
I'd kind of like to see kind of how
 
05:27:55.590 --> 05:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
those models look before we actually do
 
05:27:59.830 --> 05:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire um did did you
 
05:28:02.110 --> 05:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
have any other
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
concerns well that was part of it and I
 
05:28:09.628 --> 05:28:09.638 align:start position:0%
was concerned about the cemeter operator
 
05:28:12.590 --> 05:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
that felt
 
05:28:12.600 --> 05:28:14.910 align:start position:0%
that felt
that

05:28:14.910 --> 05:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:28:18.150 --> 05:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
compost if they wanted to call it that
 
05:28:22.230 --> 05:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
would be regulated by some federal
 
05:28:26.390 --> 05:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
agency which I'm really don't want to
 
05:28:27.788 --> 05:28:27.798 align:start position:0%
impose on
 
05:28:27.798 --> 05:28:29.390 align:start position:0%
impose on
anybody

05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
05:28:29.400 --> 05:28:32.470 align:start position:0%
anybody
um

05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:36.548 --> 05:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm concerned that some people
 
05:28:41.030 --> 05:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
that are in apparently in the business
 
05:28:43.948 --> 05:28:43.958 align:start position:0%
are don't don't seem to want to use the
 
05:28:43.958 --> 05:28:44.910 align:start position:0%
are don't don't seem to want to use the
same

05:28:44.910 --> 05:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
same
 
05:28:47.510 --> 05:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
terminology so it doesn't sound like
 
05:28:50.750 --> 05:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
this is a a
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
unified um accepted process I would I
 
05:28:55.920 --> 05:28:57.110 align:start position:0%
unified um accepted process I would I
think

05:28:57.110 --> 05:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:28:57.120 --> 05:28:59.310 align:start position:0%
think
that

05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:28:59.320 --> 05:29:02.788 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:29:02.788 --> 05:29:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:05.390 --> 05:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
since green burials are already allowed
 
05:29:08.390 --> 05:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
and there are green cemeteries in the
 
05:29:10.390 --> 05:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
state I think there is
 
05:29:14.510 --> 05:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
not not much urgency to working on
 
05:29:17.628 --> 05:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
natural organic reduction which
 
05:29:21.990 --> 05:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
sounds moderately unnatural to
 
05:29:26.990 --> 05:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
me um so I'm I'm not not inclined to
 
05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
want to to pass this bill
 
05:29:29.320 --> 05:29:31.310 align:start position:0%
want to to pass this bill
immediately

05:29:31.310 --> 05:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
05:29:34.670 --> 05:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
I will add that um I had the opportunity
 
05:29:37.430 --> 05:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
to talk to the representative of the New
 
05:29:38.830 --> 05:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Farm
 
05:29:42.708 --> 05:29:42.718 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh who informed me that there are
 
05:29:48.990 --> 05:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
folks in the state that do um animal
 
05:29:52.350 --> 05:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
composting and that does require
 
05:29:55.350 --> 05:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
permitting and sorry but we are
 
05:29:57.270 --> 05:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
technically animals we're from the
 
05:30:00.390 --> 05:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
Animal Kingdom so I think that
 
05:30:03.150 --> 05:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
particular aspect is going to have to be
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
addressed uh among other things and um I
 
05:30:11.868 --> 05:30:11.878 align:start position:0%
think uh what we would like to see is
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
for the sponsors of this bill to look at
 
05:30:17.230 --> 05:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of the questions that were raised
 
05:30:21.030 --> 05:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
during the hearing uh and we're talking
 
05:30:23.548 --> 05:30:23.558 align:start position:0%
about probably putting this into interim
 
05:30:27.190 --> 05:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
study to give you folks time to uh
 
05:30:29.548 --> 05:30:29.558 align:start position:0%
investigate and answer some of those
 
05:30:33.628 --> 05:30:33.638 align:start position:0%
issues and see if you can come back with
 
05:30:36.750 --> 05:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
uh something that will satisfy the needs
 
05:30:37.990 --> 05:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
for this
 
05:30:40.708 --> 05:30:40.718 align:start position:0%
legislation um probably after the close
 
05:30:42.830 --> 05:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
of session or possibly even at the end
 
05:30:45.510 --> 05:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
of summer uh which is when we would be
 
05:30:49.230 --> 05:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
acting on interim study bills and we can
 
05:30:52.868 --> 05:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
schedule um another meeting a work
 
05:30:56.750 --> 05:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
session on it if you think you have some
 
05:30:59.310 --> 05:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
things that satisfy some of the issues
 
05:31:00.910 --> 05:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
so that we can disc discuss it if you
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
care to representative
 
05:31:08.190 --> 05:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chairman so I I
 
05:31:10.030 --> 05:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
totally agree that there are too many
 
05:31:13.310 --> 05:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
unresolved issues uh I definitely don't
 
05:31:15.990 --> 05:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
think the bill is ready to P to pass at
 
05:31:19.030 --> 05:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
this time by the same token I think it's
 
05:31:22.868 --> 05:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
it would be uh I think it would be the
 
05:31:26.230 --> 05:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
wrong step to say itl because I think
 
05:31:29.830 --> 05:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
there a lot of uh thought is going into
 
05:31:33.350 --> 05:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
where you are already uh this place or
 
05:31:35.830 --> 05:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
that place ntion Nationwide or
 
05:31:40.070 --> 05:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
nationally anyway um and and uh so I
 
05:31:43.110 --> 05:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
think the obvious place to go is uh to
 
05:31:45.310 --> 05:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
do interim study to to work on it
 
05:31:47.868 --> 05:31:47.878 align:start position:0%
because it definitely needs work but it
 
05:31:50.470 --> 05:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's fair would be fair
 
05:31:52.628 --> 05:31:52.638 align:start position:0%
uh to the process and to the developers
 
05:31:55.628 --> 05:31:55.638 align:start position:0%
and so forth of this concept to just say
 
05:31:57.868 --> 05:31:57.878 align:start position:0%
you know go away and don't bother us
 
05:32:01.788 --> 05:32:01.798 align:start position:0%
which is kind of what an itl does so I I
 
05:32:04.948 --> 05:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
would support an interim study motion
 
05:32:08.590 --> 05:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
chase I agree with um all the statements
 
05:32:14.788 --> 05:32:14.798 align:start position:0%
and representative Maguire put my
 
05:32:17.868 --> 05:32:17.878 align:start position:0%
thoughts into play perfectly
 
05:32:20.190 --> 05:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
um I think there's way too many
 
05:32:22.670 --> 05:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
questionable variables involved with
 
05:32:25.910 --> 05:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
this and um I think things can be
 
05:32:28.830 --> 05:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
clarified I think everyone should have
 
05:32:31.510 --> 05:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
the right to um if someone wants this
 
05:32:33.350 --> 05:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
type of burial for themselves but what
 
05:32:35.788 --> 05:32:35.798 align:start position:0%
if they're they're not able to say they
 
05:32:37.990 --> 05:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
pass away and they weren't able to to
 
05:32:39.910 --> 05:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
suggest that I mean I just did way too
 
05:32:46.230 --> 05:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:51.430 --> 05:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
with worked on any for okay let's do it
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
would anyone else would anyone here like
 
05:32:54.000 --> 05:32:56.628 align:start position:0%
would anyone else would anyone here like
to

05:32:56.628 --> 05:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:32:56.638 --> 05:32:58.948 align:start position:0%
to
address

05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:32:58.958 --> 05:33:03.510 align:start position:0%
address
yeah

05:33:03.510 --> 05:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:05.030 --> 05:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to clarify that in
 
05:33:07.430 --> 05:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
Washington state it is regulated and
 
05:33:09.350 --> 05:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's regulated through their office of
 
05:33:11.628 --> 05:33:11.638 align:start position:0%
Professional Licensing and so they
 
05:33:14.310 --> 05:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
require testing of the final product for
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
heavy metals and um pathogens and once
 
05:33:19.788 --> 05:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
they've gone through that process a 100
 
05:33:22.150 --> 05:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
times then they bumped it down to 25% of
 
05:33:23.708 --> 05:33:23.718 align:start position:0%
the time it has to be tested so they do
 
05:33:25.590 --> 05:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
have a process in place and it is
 
05:33:28.150 --> 05:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
underway there and working I think quite
 
05:33:30.548 --> 05:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
smoothly um and so
 
05:33:32.708 --> 05:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
you know and I I agree are you speaking
 
05:33:35.788 --> 05:33:35.798 align:start position:0%
particularly about cremation now no no
 
05:33:37.150 --> 05:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
natural organic reduction this is about
 
05:33:39.310 --> 05:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
natural organic reduction so they
 
05:33:40.750 --> 05:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
they're they have a department of
 
05:33:42.868 --> 05:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
ecology I guess where we have a Dees and
 
05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
their de their Department of ecology
 
05:33:47.310 --> 05:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
said this is not our perview and and had
 
05:33:48.910 --> 05:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
the office a professional licensure
 
05:33:51.390 --> 05:33:51.400 align:start position:0%
there do it so um I do think there's a
 
05:33:53.590 --> 05:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
question in play as to who wants to take
 
05:33:55.150 --> 05:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
on that role in our state and making
 
05:33:57.390 --> 05:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
sure that's done and we're happy to dig
 
05:34:00.350 --> 05:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
into that further um I think the
 
05:34:03.750 --> 05:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
question raised by life Forest I I'm not
 
05:34:06.070 --> 05:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
sure what's where she's headed with that
 
05:34:09.548 --> 05:34:09.558 align:start position:0%
she reached out to USDA for organic um
 
05:34:11.830 --> 05:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
for the organic standards but you would
 
05:34:13.868 --> 05:34:13.878 align:start position:0%
never go through that process in this
 
05:34:15.628 --> 05:34:15.638 align:start position:0%
situation it's not an organic product
 
05:34:17.628 --> 05:34:17.638 align:start position:0%
that anyone's trying to sell to a in
 
05:34:20.628 --> 05:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
fact it's explicit in in our bill that
 
05:34:23.070 --> 05:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
it is not to be used for agricultural
 
05:34:25.830 --> 05:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
purposes so um I don't think that that's
 
05:34:28.230 --> 05:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
an issue the your your concern about the
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
federal requirements but again you know
 
05:34:31.310 --> 05:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know if we have time to work on it
 
05:34:33.070 --> 05:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
now we can certainly clarify that for
 
05:34:35.390 --> 05:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
you um do you
 
05:34:37.708 --> 05:34:37.718 align:start position:0%
have yes and it's certainly not an
 
05:34:42.030 --> 05:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
Agricultural Product um that it seemed
 
05:34:44.990 --> 05:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
that um this group from light Forest
 
05:34:47.110 --> 05:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
kind of went off on their own tangent
 
05:34:50.190 --> 05:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
about this and no other state is the
 
05:34:52.708 --> 05:34:52.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture involved in
 
05:34:55.430 --> 05:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
regulating natural organic reduction it
 
05:34:59.990 --> 05:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
is regulated by the same agency that
 
05:35:01.948 --> 05:35:01.958 align:start position:0%
that regulates funeral homes and
 
05:35:04.470 --> 05:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
inspects funeral homes and and the whole
 
05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
any other uh in cremation so that they
 
05:35:09.868 --> 05:35:09.878 align:start position:0%
would bring the Department of
 
05:35:13.070 --> 05:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
Agriculture into this discussion was
 
05:35:17.990 --> 05:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
really um no one else is doing that
 
05:35:22.350 --> 05:35:22.360 align:start position:0%
um and but likewise with um you wondered
 
05:35:25.390 --> 05:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
if well if you need a permit to do um
 
05:35:28.990 --> 05:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
composting of animals on a farm um it it
 
05:35:31.470 --> 05:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the US SDA who do that but
 
05:35:34.788 --> 05:35:34.798 align:start position:0%
in our bill we we clearly lay out that
 
05:35:36.390 --> 05:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
if someone's going
 
05:35:39.750 --> 05:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
to bring their remains of their loved
 
05:35:43.030 --> 05:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
one to be treated at a nor facility and
 
05:35:46.750 --> 05:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
air facility they would have to get a
 
05:35:50.150 --> 05:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
certificate the same way that they would
 
05:35:53.750 --> 05:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
to bring a a body to a Crematory it's
 
05:35:58.670 --> 05:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:58.680 --> 05:36:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
process

05:36:01.510 --> 05:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:36:04.590 --> 05:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um well like I said I I just I
 
05:36:07.150 --> 05:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
literally just bumped into this friend
 
05:36:09.190 --> 05:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
of mine who I know works at the Farm
 
05:36:12.548 --> 05:36:12.558 align:start position:0%
Bureau so I asked him and uh he said he
 
05:36:15.430 --> 05:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
would look into it he he off the top of
 
05:36:17.708 --> 05:36:17.718 align:start position:0%
his head he wasn't totally familiar with
 
05:36:20.788 --> 05:36:20.798 align:start position:0%
their uh statutes and so forth and rules
 
05:36:23.190 --> 05:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
but he was going to look into it uh I
 
05:36:26.750 --> 05:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
can give you his contact information and
 
05:36:26.760 --> 05:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
can give you his contact information and
yeah

05:36:28.390 --> 05:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
05:36:34.430 --> 05:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:38.868 --> 05:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
so yeah and you know like I said I just
 
05:36:40.830 --> 05:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
happened literally bumped into him in
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
the hall and just said well hey do you
 
05:36:58.590 --> 05:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:58.600 --> 05:37:19.470 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:37:19.470 --> 05:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:21.788 --> 05:37:21.798 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the things that uh
 
05:37:24.990 --> 05:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
comes to my mind also I think uh members
 
05:37:27.868 --> 05:37:27.878 align:start position:0%
of the committee were all shocked uh
 
05:37:30.990 --> 05:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
when you talked about um um the large
 
05:37:34.230 --> 05:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
amount of product that's produced as
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
Cremation uh you know a truck bed full
 
05:37:42.270 --> 05:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
as compared to a six or seven uh pound
 
05:37:47.110 --> 05:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
canister of Ashes uh and uh it was
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
suggested uh yeah the the family may
 
05:37:52.590 --> 05:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
want a little portion of that but I
 
05:37:55.510 --> 05:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
think we need to talk about or figure
 
05:37:58.990 --> 05:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
out what could be done to dispose of the
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
rest of that that properly uh if the
 
05:38:04.910 --> 05:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
family doesn't want to claim it or even
 
05:38:08.190 --> 05:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
if they only want a small amount yeah
 
05:38:10.270 --> 05:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
which I would
 
05:38:10.280 --> 05:38:14.590 align:start position:0%
which I would
think

05:38:14.590 --> 05:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:16.830 --> 05:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
yeah you just said some people will take
 
05:38:18.190 --> 05:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
a small
 
05:38:22.430 --> 05:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.390 --> 05:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
where but again she that they test it
 
05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
they're required to test it by
 
05:38:28.520 --> 05:38:37.910 align:start position:0%
they're required to test it by
their

05:38:37.910 --> 05:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:41.910 --> 05:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
no right you're GNA keep talking I think
 
05:38:47.310 --> 05:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:50.868 --> 05:38:50.878 align:start position:0%
you but the point is no I understand
 
05:38:54.150 --> 05:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
we're being recorded only you're
 
05:38:58.070 --> 05:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
not and well the other difference um
 
05:39:00.948 --> 05:39:00.958 align:start position:0%
like life Forest is a little different
 
05:39:04.628 --> 05:39:04.638 align:start position:0%
from a cemetery if they were to take um
 
05:39:08.430 --> 05:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
the soil from natural organic reduction
 
05:39:11.590 --> 05:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's not as though they're burying a
 
05:39:15.830 --> 05:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
person because at at this point the soil
 
05:39:19.310 --> 05:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
is soil there's really no it's not human
 
05:39:19.320 --> 05:39:20.350 align:start position:0%
is soil there's really no it's not human
remains

05:39:20.350 --> 05:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
remains
 
05:39:23.910 --> 05:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
anymore and we did try to
 
05:39:28.468 --> 05:39:28.478 align:start position:0%
address the ways that the soil might be
 
05:39:31.590 --> 05:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
um distributed or
 
05:39:36.150 --> 05:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
dispersed in the cemetery chapter and
 
05:39:38.590 --> 05:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
likewise it's it's pretty common that
 
05:39:41.430 --> 05:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
people accept that um Ash is from
 
05:39:43.350 --> 05:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
cremation people can do whatever they
 
05:39:45.948 --> 05:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
want with them there's no regulation at
 
05:39:49.510 --> 05:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
all we did try to Define what was a
 
05:39:51.910 --> 05:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
scattering Garden or a memorial for
 
05:39:54.628 --> 05:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
Forest if someone was setting up a place
 
05:39:57.390 --> 05:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
specifically to accept those things if
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
they were going to say yes we're going
 
05:40:02.628 --> 05:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
to take your ashes here and put them in
 
05:40:06.150 --> 05:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
a place with a marker for the
 
05:40:08.468 --> 05:40:08.478 align:start position:0%
person then then they are acting more
 
05:40:09.548 --> 05:40:09.558 align:start position:0%
like a
 
05:40:13.230 --> 05:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
cemetery right but if they are taking
 
05:40:17.430 --> 05:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
the ashes or the no soil with no marker
 
05:40:20.310 --> 05:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
whatsoever then they're just taking this
 
05:40:20.320 --> 05:40:21.948 align:start position:0%
whatsoever then they're just taking this
material

05:40:21.948 --> 05:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
material
 
05:40:24.948 --> 05:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
um and and using it
 
05:40:28.628 --> 05:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
to help regenerate a forest but they're
 
05:40:30.670 --> 05:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
not acting as is a
 
05:40:34.468 --> 05:40:34.478 align:start position:0%
cemetery so that's kind of the the
 
05:40:36.190 --> 05:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
difference there but we did try to
 
05:40:38.510 --> 05:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
address that and I I agree that maybe we
 
05:40:42.548 --> 05:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
could work on that I mean I believe that
 
05:40:46.868 --> 05:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
was what I believe that was why the arch
 
05:40:51.310 --> 05:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
dasis objected because they said that
 
05:40:53.390 --> 05:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
you're not treating The Remains with
 
05:40:57.230 --> 05:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
proper respect even if they have
 
05:41:00.110 --> 05:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
been combined with other elements and
 
05:41:02.350 --> 05:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
matured into soil it's
 
05:41:04.948 --> 05:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
still it's still part of a person I
 
05:41:04.958 --> 05:41:05.788 align:start position:0%
still it's still part of a person I
don't

05:41:05.788 --> 05:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:41:08.190 --> 05:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
think if you said okay we're going to
 
05:41:10.750 --> 05:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
use the the the the soil that the
 
05:41:12.670 --> 05:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
families don't want and build a BM in
 
05:41:15.270 --> 05:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
front of our our facility you wouldn't
 
05:41:18.390 --> 05:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
get much support for it I think people
 
05:41:22.150 --> 05:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
want to know that even if it's been
 
05:41:24.788 --> 05:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
degraded and processed it's still
 
05:41:26.990 --> 05:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
treated with
 
05:41:29.468 --> 05:41:29.478 align:start position:0%
respect absolutely I think that it's
 
05:41:32.270 --> 05:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
true um one of the one of the things
 
05:41:34.948 --> 05:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
that I noted uh in the piece that you
 
05:41:37.670 --> 05:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
sent us I forget I don't know if it was
 
05:41:42.390 --> 05:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
last night or this morning um item
 
05:41:46.230 --> 05:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
three um well it's like the second item
 
05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
three um says NE
 
05:41:53.708 --> 05:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
nhdes has stated they would not require
 
05:41:58.190 --> 05:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
any special regulations for no soil but
 
05:42:00.430 --> 05:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
then further down under
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
five um you state that um easement from
 
05:42:08.030 --> 05:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
future developments should follow best
 
05:42:10.868 --> 05:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
practices as defined by the Department
 
05:42:13.230 --> 05:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services so there's a
 
05:42:16.030 --> 05:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
little conflict there that needs to be
 
05:42:16.040 --> 05:42:18.270 align:start position:0%
little conflict there that needs to be
ironed

05:42:18.270 --> 05:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
ironed
 
05:42:20.788 --> 05:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
out that was a reference to an easement
 
05:42:22.868 --> 05:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
though to like protection of the land
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I think the latter was the
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
intention was to have remains go
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
someplace where it would be in
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
perpetuity a park or a a reserved place
 
05:42:35.868 --> 05:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
not suddenly built into houses in 10
 
05:42:37.830 --> 05:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
years so that was the intention there
 
05:42:40.070 --> 05:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
different from Dees regulating the
 
05:42:42.230 --> 05:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
actual product or
 
05:42:48.468 --> 05:42:48.478 align:start position:0%
soil so I meeting the I would also yes

you would care to um have any input into
 
05:43:16.310 --> 05:43:16.320 align:start position:0%

thank you would you yes yes please come

thank
 
05:43:28.430 --> 05:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
you because that that was one of the
 
05:43:31.670 --> 05:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
concerns also is whether or not um the
 
05:43:35.030 --> 05:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
community cemeteries would have to uh
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
like do special ordinances or something
 
05:43:40.548 --> 05:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
to allow this uh in their facilities
 
05:43:42.190 --> 05:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
right and for the record yeah my name is
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
Mike horn I'm uh uh Secretary treasur of
 
05:43:46.948 --> 05:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Cemetery Association
 
05:43:49.590 --> 05:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
which have about 120 members and
 
05:43:52.270 --> 05:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
represent you know 40 40 associ and
 
05:43:55.110 --> 05:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
towns and um we became aware of this
 
05:43:56.948 --> 05:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
back in mid January and couldn't make
 
05:44:00.110 --> 05:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
the hearing before um and we had a board
 
05:44:01.750 --> 05:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
meeting this morning and I said I'll be
 
05:44:03.990 --> 05:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
in conquered I'll come here to speak and
 
05:44:06.590 --> 05:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
and we're hoping to to meet with the
 
05:44:08.110 --> 05:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
representatives and have them come to
 
05:44:10.548 --> 05:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
our April meeting to speak to the
 
05:44:12.628 --> 05:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
cemeterian of which we'll have probably
 
05:44:16.230 --> 05:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
70 70 75 people there and um you know to
 
05:44:18.110 --> 05:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
learn more about what's being proposed
 
05:44:21.510 --> 05:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
and and you know hopefully we can help
 
05:44:24.350 --> 05:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
craft the the language and and and make
 
05:44:26.270 --> 05:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
it something that everybody can agree
 
05:44:27.910 --> 05:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
with you know we weren't looking so much
 
05:44:31.150 --> 05:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
at the natural organic reduction there
 
05:44:33.150 --> 05:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
was even some concern on getting more
 
05:44:35.070 --> 05:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
definitions in the state rsas about
 
05:44:36.910 --> 05:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
green burials and other stuff of which
 
05:44:39.948 --> 05:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
we you know we struggle with but uh we
 
05:44:42.430 --> 05:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted to have have our input
 
05:44:45.708 --> 05:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
considered and uh and and they did we
 
05:44:47.390 --> 05:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
did one of the representatives was
 
05:44:49.788 --> 05:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
connected to our vice president but they
 
05:44:51.510 --> 05:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to to connect and
 
05:44:54.468 --> 05:44:54.478 align:start position:0%
collaborate before this hearing so okay
 
05:44:56.190 --> 05:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming I I would
 
05:44:58.310 --> 05:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
urge you to exchange information with
 
05:44:58.320 --> 05:45:00.190 align:start position:0%
urge you to exchange information with
representative

05:45:00.190 --> 05:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:45:27.868 --> 05:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:27.878 --> 05:45:35.788 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:45:35.788 --> 05:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:38.788 --> 05:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
it would not be enacted this year but
 
05:45:41.150 --> 05:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
what we would do is if you come back to
 
05:45:42.910 --> 05:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
us with something that we feel is
 
05:45:45.390 --> 05:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
workable we would recommend it for
 
05:45:55.110 --> 05:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:58.670 --> 05:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
bium I'm I'm a first term rep so I don't
 
05:45:59.868 --> 05:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
understand understand the process very
 
05:46:02.830 --> 05:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
well but would we meet again with the
 
05:46:07.030 --> 05:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee as or do we just to be honest
 
05:46:09.030 --> 05:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's up to the committee and some
 
05:46:11.708 --> 05:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
committees don't take it very seriously
 
05:46:13.948 --> 05:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
but Edna has the bad habit of actually
 
05:46:16.590 --> 05:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
working on most of our inter study okay
 
05:46:19.270 --> 05:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
so we would expect to meet with the
 
05:46:22.750 --> 05:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
interested parties to answer some of the
 
05:46:24.830 --> 05:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
questions and resolve some of the
 
05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
hanging issues okay so we would do our
 
05:46:29.270 --> 05:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
homework and come back with some new
 
05:46:31.430 --> 05:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
ideas and bring everyone to the table
 
05:46:34.948 --> 05:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
for a session yes if we choose to have
 
05:46:37.948 --> 05:46:37.958 align:start position:0%
another subcommittee meeting uh it would
 
05:46:41.230 --> 05:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
be broadcast to you as this notice was
 
05:46:44.110 --> 05:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
sent to you as sponsors and we would
 
05:46:47.190 --> 05:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
probably notify the interested parties
 
05:46:50.270 --> 05:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
as well to come to see what kind of
 
05:46:52.910 --> 05:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
compromise you may have reached okay and
 
05:46:56.190 --> 05:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
then and then eventually uh the full
 
05:46:59.230 --> 05:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
committee will have to vote on whether
 
05:47:02.150 --> 05:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
or not we recommend uh future
 
05:47:04.788 --> 05:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
legislation okay so you have like two
 
05:47:07.230 --> 05:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
bites of the Apple coming still okay
 
05:47:07.240 --> 05:47:07.910 align:start position:0%
bites of the Apple coming still okay
thank

05:47:07.910 --> 05:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:47:10.948 --> 05:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
you okay I a Christian
 
05:47:10.958 --> 05:47:14.190 align:start position:0%
you okay I a Christian
minister

05:47:14.190 --> 05:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:14.200 --> 05:47:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
problem

05:47:15.990 --> 05:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:47:19.110 --> 05:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm a Christian minister and um so I
 
05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
just want to be fair and let you know I
 
05:47:22.110 --> 05:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
I do have a problem with this bill we
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
can say you know you put a body in it
 
05:47:26.350 --> 05:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
comes out that this is not human marins
 
05:47:28.350 --> 05:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
it is so I do have a problem with the
 
05:47:31.110 --> 05:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
bill I'm just being honest so um take
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
that in cons
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:57.628 --> 05:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:57.638 --> 05:50:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:50:14.830 --> 05:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:16.190 --> 05:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
right we're talking this is the subc
 
05:50:20.030 --> 05:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
community meeting for House Bill
 
05:50:23.590 --> 05:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
1486 which talks about proxy carbon
 
05:50:26.830 --> 05:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
pricing and state procurement so I think
 
05:50:28.830 --> 05:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
what we are the reason why we we called
 
05:50:30.830 --> 05:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee meeting was because
 
05:50:32.590 --> 05:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
frankly the commit the
 
05:50:35.270 --> 05:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
hearing had a lot of extra stuff in it
 
05:50:38.510 --> 05:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
which made it very confusing so I'm
 
05:50:40.628 --> 05:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
hoping you can tell us what the bill is
 
05:50:44.590 --> 05:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
about and what um what it
 
05:50:47.670 --> 05:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
means well what it's about what you
 
05:50:50.350 --> 05:50:50.360 align:start position:0%
would you like the state to do and what
 
05:50:53.468 --> 05:50:53.478 align:start position:0%
would it do you know how would it be
 
05:50:56.590 --> 05:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
effective I guess that's what we need to
 
05:50:59.390 --> 05:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
know all right thank you very much Madam
 
05:51:02.430 --> 05:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
chair and uh I for the record and I'm
 
05:51:05.150 --> 05:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
Nick Gera um State Rep from Kean
 
05:51:09.430 --> 05:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
district one uh chesher one so the idea
 
05:51:13.750 --> 05:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
behind this bill is to make purchasing
 
05:51:15.830 --> 05:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
to have the state make purchasing
 
05:51:17.830 --> 05:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
decisions that are in the best interest
 
05:51:21.830 --> 05:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers and also keeps in mind in
 
05:51:25.110 --> 05:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
this case the pricing of carbon as a
 
05:51:27.310 --> 05:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
part of the formula that the state uses
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate apprciate the
 
05:51:30.430 --> 05:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to the subcommittee
 
05:51:33.230 --> 05:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
because I think the discussion and and
 
05:51:36.350 --> 05:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
the the original hearing got off topic
 
05:51:38.390 --> 05:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh into much larger questions about
 
05:51:40.230 --> 05:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing in general and carbon
 
05:51:43.750 --> 05:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
taxes and consumer behavior um I think
 
05:51:45.430 --> 05:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
good questions were asked there about
 
05:51:46.990 --> 05:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
you know those kind larger issues but
 
05:51:50.070 --> 05:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is specifically about State
 
05:51:52.430 --> 05:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
purchasing decisions it's not about
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
carbon tax it's not about trying to
 
05:51:57.310 --> 05:51:57.320 align:start position:0%
influence consumer Behavior across the
 
05:51:59.270 --> 05:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
state or the region or any of those
 
05:52:03.830 --> 05:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
things it's saying that looking at the
 
05:52:05.948 --> 05:52:05.958 align:start position:0%
energy landscape right now we see that
 
05:52:08.310 --> 05:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
Canada has adopted a carbon pricing
 
05:52:10.990 --> 05:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
model the European Union has adopted a
 
05:52:14.548 --> 05:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing model right that is going
 
05:52:18.910 --> 05:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
to eventually end up somehow working
 
05:52:21.270 --> 05:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
into our system because these are
 
05:52:23.070 --> 05:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
enormous trading partners for the United
 
05:52:25.150 --> 05:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
States and so we we get put at an
 
05:52:25.160 --> 05:52:26.150 align:start position:0%
States and so we we get put at an
economic

05:52:26.150 --> 05:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
economic
 
05:52:28.390 --> 05:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
disadvantage when we're working with in
 
05:52:29.708 --> 05:52:29.718 align:start position:0%
a different system than they are we're
 
05:52:31.830 --> 05:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
going to be paying carbon taxes from
 
05:52:34.070 --> 05:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
Canada and the European Union there will
 
05:52:36.390 --> 05:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
be uh penalties in all likelihood
 
05:52:38.430 --> 05:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
applied to American companies exporting
 
05:52:40.230 --> 05:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
right so we're going to have to somehow
 
05:52:43.310 --> 05:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
move in the direction of a carbon model
 
05:52:46.708 --> 05:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
right so what this bill does is says
 
05:52:49.990 --> 05:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
that let's use a proxy price right we
 
05:52:51.430 --> 05:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't have a system right now and it's
 
05:52:53.830 --> 05:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
not proposing any carbon tax or anything
 
05:52:55.628 --> 05:52:55.638 align:start position:0%
it's saying let's look at the market
 
05:52:56.990 --> 05:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
let's look at what the Canada and the
 
05:52:59.548 --> 05:52:59.558 align:start position:0%
European Union are doing and let's use a
 
05:52:59.558 --> 05:53:01.110 align:start position:0%
European Union are doing and let's use a
proxy

05:53:01.110 --> 05:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
proxy
 
05:53:03.190 --> 05:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
price eventually we're going to have to
 
05:53:06.190 --> 05:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
go in this direction let's use that when
 
05:53:08.070 --> 05:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
we make a decision if we are renovating
 
05:53:10.150 --> 05:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
a state building if we're building a new
 
05:53:13.628 --> 05:53:13.638 align:start position:0%
facility if we're buying vehicles for
 
05:53:16.070 --> 05:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
transportation let's use that proxy
 
05:53:18.590 --> 05:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
price as we calculate how much it's
 
05:53:20.590 --> 05:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
going to cost to run this thing over the
 
05:53:21.948 --> 05:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
course of its lifetime right so if
 
05:53:25.150 --> 05:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
you're installing a new HVAC system
 
05:53:26.708 --> 05:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
either in a renovated building or in a
 
05:53:29.190 --> 05:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
new building right we price these things
 
05:53:30.750 --> 05:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
how much is it going to cost us to
 
05:53:32.750 --> 05:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
operate this thing over the lifetime of
 
05:53:32.760 --> 05:53:33.590 align:start position:0%
operate this thing over the lifetime of
that

05:53:33.590 --> 05:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:53:36.910 --> 05:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
system this puts a this proxy carbon
 
05:53:40.310 --> 05:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
price in the mix right so if we say at
 
05:53:43.270 --> 05:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
this point in time we have system a a
 
05:53:45.070 --> 05:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
traditional kind of heating
 
05:53:47.310 --> 05:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
system how much is it going to cost to
 
05:53:51.270 --> 05:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
operate that thing for 30 years right if
 
05:53:53.510 --> 05:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
in 30 years or well before that we have
 
05:53:55.990 --> 05:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
a prox we have an actual carbon price we
 
05:53:57.468 --> 05:53:57.478 align:start position:0%
have to factor that in it's going to be
 
05:53:58.910 --> 05:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
part of the cost of operating that
 
05:53:58.920 --> 05:54:00.830 align:start position:0%
part of the cost of operating that
system

05:54:00.830 --> 05:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:54:03.390 --> 05:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
right let's not use the you know
 
05:54:04.910 --> 05:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
eventually we're going to have that
 
05:54:06.670 --> 05:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
basically what we're doing but just s
 
05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
having I view this as sort of like a
 
05:54:11.670 --> 05:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
trial run it's an
 
05:54:14.510 --> 05:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
experiment to see how this would affect
 
05:54:16.910 --> 05:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
our decision
 
05:54:19.670 --> 05:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
making is that right yes so thank you
 
05:54:21.750 --> 05:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
very much for asking that question so
 
05:54:24.910 --> 05:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's written would require
 
05:54:26.310 --> 05:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
05:54:30.150 --> 05:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
services to factor it in in what I have
 
05:54:31.708 --> 05:54:31.718 align:start position:0%
uh thought about and I'd be willing to
 
05:54:33.948 --> 05:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
you know I'd be happy to talk to you all
 
05:54:36.548 --> 05:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
about is the idea that through an
 
05:54:39.390 --> 05:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
amendment we could change the bill
 
05:54:41.990 --> 05:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
exactly as you suggest to say that it is
 
05:54:44.468 --> 05:54:44.478 align:start position:0%
not a binding part of the
 
05:54:46.750 --> 05:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
formula but that when we make these
 
05:54:49.628 --> 05:54:49.638 align:start position:0%
decisions they're calculated and they're
 
05:54:52.708 --> 05:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
recorded and then over five years over
 
05:54:54.708 --> 05:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
10 years from now or after the the
 
05:54:57.230 --> 05:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
enactment of the legislation we can look
 
05:55:00.468 --> 05:55:00.478 align:start position:0%
at that history and we can say
 
05:55:03.270 --> 05:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay what was the better decision and if
 
05:55:05.868 --> 05:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
it turns out that this model was not
 
05:55:08.070 --> 05:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
would not have saved taxpayers money
 
05:55:10.110 --> 05:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
then we have the evidence we need right
 
05:55:11.628 --> 05:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
and if somebody comes forward with a
 
05:55:13.788 --> 05:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
similar bill you say no because we have
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
this evidence that it doesn't work right
 
05:55:17.628 --> 05:55:17.638 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that and and I'm
 
05:55:19.990 --> 05:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely amendable uh so to speak to
 
05:55:22.190 --> 05:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would make it
 
05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
non-binding and simply have it be
 
05:55:26.548 --> 05:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
reported as a part of the
 
05:55:29.910 --> 05:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
process Okay so I think that's helpful
 
05:55:33.830 --> 05:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
the other issue is how how much of an
 
05:55:37.270 --> 05:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
effort does it take for
 
05:55:39.708 --> 05:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
our the fact that the
 
05:55:44.750 --> 05:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
Dr I mean Department Das Dr geez the Das
 
05:55:47.628 --> 05:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
is not here to testify against it leads
 
05:55:49.230 --> 05:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
me to believe that they're sort of they
 
05:55:50.750 --> 05:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
have no opinion of it because they
 
05:55:53.230 --> 05:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
certainly are here when they're against
 
05:55:57.190 --> 05:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
something so how um how much of an
 
05:56:00.230 --> 05:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
effort is inv involves is it it's not
 
05:56:03.070 --> 05:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
for every single thing that we buy it's
 
05:56:05.548 --> 05:56:05.558 align:start position:0%
only for things that are related to
 
05:56:08.270 --> 05:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
energy is that right yes thank you very
 
05:56:10.270 --> 05:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
much and I appreciate uh you pointing
 
05:56:12.190 --> 05:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
out that you know if the department of
 
05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
administrative Services I assume if this
 
05:56:17.548 --> 05:56:17.558 align:start position:0%
was a mountain to lift uh they would
 
05:56:19.510 --> 05:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
come and they would say you know we
 
05:56:21.110 --> 05:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
can't do this the effective date is
 
05:56:24.468 --> 05:56:24.478 align:start position:0%
January 1st right of 2025 so again if
 
05:56:26.030 --> 05:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
this was a concern that they had that
 
05:56:28.310 --> 05:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do it in time I assume
 
05:56:29.948 --> 05:56:29.958 align:start position:0%
that somebody from that department would
 
05:56:31.948 --> 05:56:31.958 align:start position:0%
be here telling us either you know we
 
05:56:35.110 --> 05:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
need longer or we can't do it so um I I
 
05:56:38.030 --> 05:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question and uh
 
05:56:43.390 --> 05:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
I it is specific to purchases on uh
 
05:56:46.190 --> 05:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
equipment including say automobiles that
 
05:56:49.390 --> 05:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
consume carbon right so it it's not on
 
05:56:51.390 --> 05:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
everything you know when you're building
 
05:56:53.350 --> 05:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
a new structure for example it is
 
05:56:55.750 --> 05:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
specific for example to the an HVAC
 
05:56:57.990 --> 05:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
system as opposed to you know all of the
 
05:57:00.030 --> 05:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
other bidding that has to be done on on
 
05:57:02.590 --> 05:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
the various kind of subcontracts so yes
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:14.190 --> 05:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
carbon thank you
 
05:57:17.948 --> 05:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
um my my concern is
 
05:57:22.310 --> 05:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
a what I what I'll term as a creeping
 
05:57:25.150 --> 05:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
Elegance in the direction of
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
electrification we've we have seen
 
05:57:32.750 --> 05:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
hard evidence that across the state at
 
05:57:36.350 --> 05:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
different points there have been efforts
 
05:57:39.390 --> 05:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
to um and we're talking at at the
 
05:57:41.390 --> 05:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
consumer level and I know this this bill
 
05:57:44.590 --> 05:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
is right now not trying to attack
 
05:57:47.510 --> 05:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
consumer issues but but to me it's it's
 
05:57:50.230 --> 05:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
incremental this is
 
05:57:54.070 --> 05:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
incremental uh efforts to get there at
 
05:57:56.708 --> 05:57:56.718 align:start position:0%
some point
 
05:58:00.590 --> 05:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
um that through the planning board
 
05:58:03.750 --> 05:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
process there have been efforts AC in
 
05:58:05.548 --> 05:58:05.558 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state and and
 
05:58:07.150 --> 05:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
we've seen evidence mostly along the
 
05:58:09.110 --> 05:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
western part of the state close to the
 
05:58:09.120 --> 05:58:10.150 align:start position:0%
western part of the state close to the
Vermont

05:58:10.150 --> 05:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
05:58:14.270 --> 05:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
border uh where planning boards have
 
05:58:17.788 --> 05:58:17.798 align:start position:0%
been uh encouraged or told not to
 
05:58:20.708 --> 05:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
approve any any plans that didn't in
 
05:58:22.548 --> 05:58:22.558 align:start position:0%
that didn't require
 
05:58:26.150 --> 05:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
electrification of utilities you can't
 
05:58:28.590 --> 05:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
you know new new homes that are about to
 
05:58:28.600 --> 05:58:29.590 align:start position:0%
you know new new homes that are about to
be

05:58:29.590 --> 05:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:58:32.670 --> 05:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
approved can't be approved with furnaces
 
05:58:36.310 --> 05:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
that use oil or or gas they have to use
 
05:58:40.948 --> 05:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
heat pumps electric heat pumps and and
 
05:58:43.830 --> 05:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
so uh and we had to we've had to step in
 
05:58:48.548 --> 05:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
and say no uh the the consumer needs to
 
05:58:50.190 --> 05:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
be able to be in charge of making their
 
05:58:52.788 --> 05:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
own decisions about things like that and
 
05:58:54.708 --> 05:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
we and the the government shouldn't be
 
05:58:59.510 --> 05:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
mandating that uh so my concern is that
 
05:59:03.670 --> 05:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
that that while that specific example
 
05:59:07.430 --> 05:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply really to this bill it's
 
05:59:10.830 --> 05:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
it's this incrementalism or or looking
 
05:59:12.948 --> 05:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
to push in that direction so that at
 
05:59:15.830 --> 05:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
some point in time and say well it's now
 
05:59:18.830 --> 05:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
time to flip the switch no pun intended
 
05:59:21.070 --> 05:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
but flip the switch to say we're going
 
05:59:26.468 --> 05:59:26.478 align:start position:0%
to now require what we were just before
 
05:59:28.590 --> 05:59:28.600 align:start position:0%
watching or looking at are evaluating
 
05:59:29.670 --> 05:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
now it's a
 
05:59:33.990 --> 05:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
requirement uh to say You must now when
 
05:59:38.070 --> 05:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
you buy a heating system for the state
 
05:59:40.868 --> 05:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
the new parking garage across the street
 
05:59:42.788 --> 05:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
is going to have to use electric heat
 
05:59:46.990 --> 05:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
pumps will not be allowed to to use uh
 
05:59:51.750 --> 05:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
propane heaters or U natural gas heaters
 
05:59:55.948 --> 05:59:55.958 align:start position:0%
or whatever um and and that's what
 
05:59:57.590 --> 05:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm concerned about is how
 
06:00:00.310 --> 06:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
how do how do we is there are there any
 
06:00:02.590 --> 06:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
ways to put safeguards in so that we
 
06:00:05.190 --> 06:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
this doesn't all of a sudden there be
 
06:00:09.788 --> 06:00:09.798 align:start position:0%
like a giant blob that devours us and we
 
06:00:11.750 --> 06:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
we turn around one day five years from
 
06:00:13.510 --> 06:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
now and say how do we get here I said
 
06:00:16.868 --> 06:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
well uh it's everything has to be
 
06:00:22.150 --> 06:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
electric I mean and using myself and and
 
06:00:23.590 --> 06:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
please allow me
 
06:00:26.310 --> 06:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
I'm being diverting a little bit here no
 
06:00:28.628 --> 06:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
go ahead couple of days ago with with
 
06:00:32.548 --> 06:00:32.558 align:start position:0%
this heavy snowstorm we had we lost in
 
06:00:35.830 --> 06:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
London der where I'm from we've a
 
06:00:39.150 --> 06:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
terrible uh experience with osaurus who
 
06:00:41.708 --> 06:00:41.718 align:start position:0%
lose power all the time and I happen to
 
06:00:43.590 --> 06:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
live on a culdesac which means you're
 
06:00:45.910 --> 06:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
going to get the power last
 
06:00:48.830 --> 06:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
back um but we lose power all the time
 
06:00:52.670 --> 06:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
so to mitigate that uh because I did a
 
06:00:54.430 --> 06:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
lot of business travel and when I was
 
06:00:56.468 --> 06:00:56.478 align:start position:0%
gone I didn't want my wife out there
 
06:00:58.788 --> 06:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
trying to pour gas lean into a oh come
 
06:01:02.390 --> 06:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
on a small generator a small
 
06:01:05.948 --> 06:01:05.958 align:start position:0%
generator uh and she and she was too
 
06:01:09.670 --> 06:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
afraid anyway she refused to do it so uh
 
06:01:12.670 --> 06:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
by herself right so so I went out and
 
06:01:16.110 --> 06:01:16.120 align:start position:0%
invested $22,000 into a a
 
06:01:19.990 --> 06:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
propane uh generator a whole house
 
06:01:22.110 --> 06:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
generator so when the power goes out it
 
06:01:24.190 --> 06:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
comes back on in about 10 seconds and
 
06:01:26.070 --> 06:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
she's she's got power and she's not in
 
06:01:28.670 --> 06:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
the dark and in the cold
 
06:01:30.948 --> 06:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
that's a that's an option as a homeowner
 
06:01:34.030 --> 06:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
that I want it's an option if I were to
 
06:01:38.750 --> 06:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
translate that as a as a uh a
 
06:01:41.628 --> 06:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
community uh a police station I want a
 
06:01:43.750 --> 06:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
diesel generator running when the power
 
06:01:46.590 --> 06:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
goes out to the to to power the the
 
06:01:50.030 --> 06:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
police station not just an an electric
 
06:01:52.990 --> 06:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh line to the to the to the electric
 
06:01:55.110 --> 06:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
company that's gone out anyway because
 
06:01:58.270 --> 06:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
there's no power now uh or the fire
 
06:02:00.830 --> 06:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
station they also have de diesel
 
06:02:03.430 --> 06:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
generators to fire up and and now it's a
 
06:02:07.150 --> 06:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
safety issue so what I'm concerned about
 
06:02:08.150 --> 06:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
is this
 
06:02:11.030 --> 06:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
electrification but it it
 
06:02:13.548 --> 06:02:13.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't I'm thinking about the consumer
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
side of it we're not we're not in this
 
06:02:17.510 --> 06:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill talking consumer but we are talking
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
about large purchases of of government
 
06:02:25.030 --> 06:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
agencies and a police station is a
 
06:02:25.040 --> 06:02:26.350 align:start position:0%
agencies and a police station is a
government

06:02:26.350 --> 06:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:02:26.360 --> 06:02:28.150 align:start position:0%
government
agency

06:02:28.150 --> 06:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
agency
 
06:02:31.110 --> 06:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's state right but you know once we
 
06:02:34.230 --> 06:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
require it for the State Police how long
 
06:02:37.788 --> 06:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
will it be before it migrates to the
 
06:02:40.910 --> 06:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
Community Police or the from the or to
 
06:02:43.310 --> 06:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
the community fire station so so I I
 
06:02:46.788 --> 06:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
just think we're on a we talked slippery
 
06:02:48.990 --> 06:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
slope earlier everybody knows how I feel
 
06:02:51.190 --> 06:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
about that word right so we won't go
 
06:02:55.430 --> 06:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
there but anyway um I I just think we we
 
06:02:57.670 --> 06:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful we don't TI eles
 
06:03:01.310 --> 06:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
into nuts and and end up like California
 
06:03:03.270 --> 06:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
is now with rolling blackouts and brown
 
06:03:05.510 --> 06:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
outs and so forth because they're so
 
06:03:08.510 --> 06:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
overcommitted to electrification and
 
06:03:10.948 --> 06:03:10.958 align:start position:0%
even even in large Power Systems like
 
06:03:13.390 --> 06:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
Community Power Systems and so forth so
 
06:03:16.270 --> 06:03:16.280 align:start position:0%
we we've got I would think we need some
 
06:03:18.190 --> 06:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
protection and I don't know if it's a
 
06:03:20.948 --> 06:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
study or do some
 
06:03:25.468 --> 06:03:25.478 align:start position:0%
analysis or uh and I I'm not a big fan
 
06:03:27.468 --> 06:03:27.478 align:start position:0%
of studies because I'm on a I'm on on
 
06:03:30.030 --> 06:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
the the commission on to get rid of all
 
06:03:32.430 --> 06:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
these study studies commissions that we
 
06:03:35.230 --> 06:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
have but anyway this this to me if you
 
06:03:37.510 --> 06:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
want to go down this path it needs a lot
 
06:03:39.548 --> 06:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
more thought and a lot more analysis so
 
06:03:41.830 --> 06:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
we don't back ourselves into the corner
 
06:03:44.110 --> 06:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
where we're we're we're now stuck and
 
06:03:48.070 --> 06:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
can't and can't use our resources our
 
06:03:51.548 --> 06:03:51.558 align:start position:0%
our energy resources to help us navigate
 
06:03:56.190 --> 06:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
through emergency periods and and so
 
06:04:00.350 --> 06:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
forth you I just want I
 
06:04:03.548 --> 06:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
just so I I wanted to make sure that
 
06:04:06.430 --> 06:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
with the disc with the amendment that
 
06:04:09.910 --> 06:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative gerana is
 
06:04:11.830 --> 06:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
proposing it
 
06:04:14.670 --> 06:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't what we would do is exactly I
 
06:04:16.548 --> 06:04:16.558 align:start position:0%
think what you're trying to do is we're
 
06:04:19.310 --> 06:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
we're only Gathering data on the state
 
06:04:22.750 --> 06:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
level to see if this at all even works
 
06:04:25.390 --> 06:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to make any decisions
 
06:04:29.110 --> 06:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
based on it or we're not going to um
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
yeah we're not going to you know decide
 
06:04:32.430 --> 06:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
anything on it it's really just a matter
 
06:04:35.868 --> 06:04:35.878 align:start position:0%
of gathering data to see if at all if
 
06:04:38.670 --> 06:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
this is something
 
06:04:41.990 --> 06:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
that would be beneficial long term and
 
06:04:44.030 --> 06:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
maybe it won't be but rather than
 
06:04:45.990 --> 06:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
mandating that we do something that we
 
06:04:48.150 --> 06:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
don't know anything about what we're
 
06:04:50.628 --> 06:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
doing is we're in a way creating an
 
06:04:52.948 --> 06:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
experiment which I'm a big experiment
 
06:04:55.750 --> 06:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
person myself so let's experiment let's
 
06:04:58.910 --> 06:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
gather the data and then determine where
 
06:05:01.628 --> 06:05:01.638 align:start position:0%
we are I I would just like to know for
 
06:05:04.070 --> 06:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
example if we were doing this as an
 
06:05:06.390 --> 06:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
experiment how much time do we need to
 
06:05:09.030 --> 06:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
gather enough data to know whether what
 
06:05:11.788 --> 06:05:11.798 align:start position:0%
the effect of this would
 
06:05:14.670 --> 06:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
be U thank you uh and I'd also like if I
 
06:05:16.270 --> 06:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
may to address another part of
 
06:05:18.708 --> 06:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
Representative Dolan's concerns in terms
 
06:05:22.590 --> 06:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
of kind of what is the um kind of safety
 
06:05:23.990 --> 06:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
involved here right so that we don't go
 
06:05:26.070 --> 06:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
down this slippery slope and and I would
 
06:05:27.670 --> 06:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
say that in this bill the difference
 
06:05:29.510 --> 06:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
between what you see in California for
 
06:05:30.750 --> 06:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
example or some of the things that I
 
06:05:32.468 --> 06:05:32.478 align:start position:0%
think that you're concerned about is
 
06:05:34.628 --> 06:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
that the target the specific Target
 
06:05:36.830 --> 06:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
underlying legislation like that is the
 
06:05:39.590 --> 06:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
reduction in greenhouse gases the Target
 
06:05:41.670 --> 06:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
in this bill is what is going to save
 
06:05:43.830 --> 06:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money right so the the
 
06:05:47.030 --> 06:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental underlying principle is not
 
06:05:48.670 --> 06:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to purchase the things that
 
06:05:51.150 --> 06:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
will have the lowest the least carbon
 
06:05:53.230 --> 06:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
footprint I think that's the kind of
 
06:05:54.590 --> 06:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
thing that you're concerned about and we
 
06:05:56.708 --> 06:05:56.718 align:start position:0%
could disagree about that but this bill
 
06:05:58.708 --> 06:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
does do that this bill says that the
 
06:06:01.190 --> 06:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
metric that we're concerned with is
 
06:06:03.510 --> 06:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
saving taxpayer money and I think if
 
06:06:04.750 --> 06:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
that's the metric if that's the
 
06:06:08.150 --> 06:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
fundamental underlying principle um I I
 
06:06:10.350 --> 06:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
I think that should address some of the
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
concerns that you have because as you
 
06:06:13.390 --> 06:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
said it's not we're going to buy this
 
06:06:16.030 --> 06:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
thing just because it has a smaller
 
06:06:17.868 --> 06:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
footprint right we're going to do it
 
06:06:19.708 --> 06:06:19.718 align:start position:0%
ideally because it's going to cost
 
06:06:22.708 --> 06:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayers less so I hope that speaks to
 
06:06:25.468 --> 06:06:25.478 align:start position:0%
some of your concerns about uh how this
 
06:06:27.868 --> 06:06:27.878 align:start position:0%
legislation fits into the larger
 
06:06:30.548 --> 06:06:30.558 align:start position:0%
patterns that you're concerned about I
 
06:06:32.670 --> 06:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
like the language about saving taxpayer
 
06:06:35.350 --> 06:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
money but I
 
06:06:38.310 --> 06:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
think I think the evidence before us is
 
06:06:40.510 --> 06:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
that this is going to cost the taxpayers
 
06:06:43.030 --> 06:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
more money and you have to look at
 
06:06:46.310 --> 06:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
longterm versus short term in the short
 
06:06:50.468 --> 06:06:50.478 align:start position:0%
term if we could get
 
06:06:54.270 --> 06:06:54.280 align:start position:0%
a185 uh fuel that would be saving us
 
06:06:57.430 --> 06:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
money as opposed to uh
 
06:07:01.948 --> 06:07:01.958 align:start position:0%
$5 a gallon but $5 a gallon may be what
 
06:07:04.948 --> 06:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
the long-term cost is in terms of you
 
06:07:07.750 --> 06:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
know the carbon footprint uh type
 
06:07:10.628 --> 06:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
analysis so so we really need
 
06:07:13.708 --> 06:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
to bring into the discussion short-term
 
06:07:16.708 --> 06:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
costs long-term costs uh short-term
 
06:07:19.670 --> 06:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
costs I think I think by
 
06:07:22.350 --> 06:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
maximizing uh
 
06:07:26.708 --> 06:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
energy um availability is the this is
 
06:07:30.670 --> 06:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
the the tax saving formula in the short
 
06:07:33.590 --> 06:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
term I think a case can be made that if
 
06:07:34.750 --> 06:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
we don't pay attention to the
 
06:07:36.590 --> 06:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
environment that it's is there going to
 
06:07:39.190 --> 06:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
be a long-term cost that it's going to
 
06:07:42.510 --> 06:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
cost us more in the long term but but we
 
06:07:44.868 --> 06:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
that we that needs to enter into the
 
06:07:47.510 --> 06:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
discussion so people understand that
 
06:07:49.628 --> 06:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
we're going to walk away from
 
06:07:52.430 --> 06:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
a185 uh fuel cost and we're going to go
 
06:07:55.310 --> 06:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
to a $5 fuel cost because 10 years from
 
06:07:58.110 --> 06:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
now we're all going to be paying
 
06:07:59.948 --> 06:07:59.958 align:start position:0%
$20 I hear what you're saying
 
06:08:01.628 --> 06:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
representative but that's not to my
 
06:08:02.590 --> 06:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
understanding that's not how the
 
06:08:04.350 --> 06:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
06:08:05.750 --> 06:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
determines how they're going to purchase
 
06:08:07.670 --> 06:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
equipment and that's what this is about
 
06:08:09.030 --> 06:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
so I hear what you're saying and that
 
06:08:10.230 --> 06:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
this became part of that larger
 
06:08:12.310 --> 06:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
discussion in the committee right and
 
06:08:14.190 --> 06:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
that's an important discussion to have
 
06:08:15.510 --> 06:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
and it's very complex for all the
 
06:08:17.350 --> 06:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
reasons that you indicate that's not
 
06:08:19.190 --> 06:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
what this is about and the department of
 
06:08:21.350 --> 06:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
administrative Service as I said to my
 
06:08:23.430 --> 06:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
understanding does not use any of those
 
06:08:25.510 --> 06:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
things when it determines what kinds of
 
06:08:26.910 --> 06:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
equipment to buy the question is how how
 
06:08:32.350 --> 06:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
do we how do we um do a test or an
 
06:08:35.070 --> 06:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
analysis that's not
 
06:08:36.628 --> 06:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
open-ended and I think the
 
06:08:38.788 --> 06:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
representative groda Madam chair
 
06:08:40.190 --> 06:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
referred to that so two things I would
 
06:08:43.270 --> 06:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
say one I'm I'm happy to I've asked OS
 
06:08:44.708 --> 06:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
for some language they haven't been able
 
06:08:46.150 --> 06:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
to get back to me that I would share
 
06:08:48.070 --> 06:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
with you all that again would make it
 
06:08:49.750 --> 06:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
non-binding so in that case we're
 
06:08:53.270 --> 06:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
Gathering data and then um you know if
 
06:08:55.430 --> 06:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
if we want to talk about what kind of
 
06:08:57.270 --> 06:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
time period we're looking at
 
06:08:59.548 --> 06:08:59.558 align:start position:0%
I mean to say that it's open-ended I I
 
06:09:01.628 --> 06:09:01.638 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily think is a bad thing
 
06:09:03.070 --> 06:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
because it would require further
 
06:09:05.830 --> 06:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to change it into something
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
that was generally binding right so if
 
06:09:10.190 --> 06:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
there's no further legislation and we're
 
06:09:12.788 --> 06:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
just Gathering data for five or 10 years
 
06:09:14.788 --> 06:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
whatever we have five or 10 years worth
 
06:09:17.110 --> 06:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
of data to look back at and again if
 
06:09:19.030 --> 06:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
someone comes before the committee with
 
06:09:21.510 --> 06:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
a bill that wants to make it binding we
 
06:09:24.030 --> 06:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
then can say well we we now have say a
 
06:09:26.110 --> 06:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
decade's worth of data so I I personally
 
06:09:28.030 --> 06:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
don't see any need to put into the
 
06:09:30.628 --> 06:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
legislation a Sunset date date for this
 
06:09:33.150 --> 06:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
because it's not going to enact anything
 
06:09:35.190 --> 06:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's not going to make it binding after
 
06:09:37.150 --> 06:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
a certain period of time so I don't
 
06:09:39.070 --> 06:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
personally see that as as being
 
06:09:41.910 --> 06:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
necessary but I'm we typically don't
 
06:09:44.948 --> 06:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
keep things running forever we typically
 
06:09:46.590 --> 06:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
have a sunset
 
06:09:49.788 --> 06:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
time okay and so whatever the committee
 
06:09:51.390 --> 06:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
thinks is reasonable I would certainly
 
06:09:53.830 --> 06:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to have that as part of an
 
06:09:55.990 --> 06:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
amendment oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to
 
06:09:58.628 --> 06:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
step on you that's
 
06:10:00.910 --> 06:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay guess I need
 
06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
this um I've lived in a house with heat
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
pumps and they're fine but they use
 
06:10:10.590 --> 06:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
electricity and electricity is going to
 
06:10:13.590 --> 06:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
put whatever in the in the air plus the
 
06:10:17.070 --> 06:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity is going to go up so
 
06:10:18.948 --> 06:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
we're not gaining
 
06:10:21.990 --> 06:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
anything by using something like a heat
 
06:10:26.030 --> 06:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
pump um we're going to still end up Uh
 
06:10:27.868 --> 06:10:27.878 align:start position:0%
something's got I mean granted maybe
 
06:10:29.868 --> 06:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
they'll put solar panels or they'll have
 
06:10:32.190 --> 06:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
wind or something to generate the
 
06:10:34.830 --> 06:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
electricity but until we get to that
 
06:10:37.430 --> 06:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
point we're a long way from
 
06:10:39.990 --> 06:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
it those aren't
 
06:10:43.750 --> 06:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
practical just for pollution purposes
 
06:10:45.310 --> 06:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
well what I would say I I appreciate
 
06:10:46.350 --> 06:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
that and that came up in the in the
 
06:10:48.230 --> 06:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing too in terms of a lot
 
06:10:49.390 --> 06:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
of the things we power through
 
06:10:52.430 --> 06:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
electricity right you know 50% I believe
 
06:10:54.990 --> 06:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
of our of our electricity is is
 
06:10:56.910 --> 06:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
generated on fossil fuels and that would
 
06:11:00.590 --> 06:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
be calculated into the the price so
 
06:11:01.910 --> 06:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
again in this case if we were talking
 
06:11:03.548 --> 06:11:03.558 align:start position:0%
about a non-binding price we're just
 
06:11:05.590 --> 06:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
trying to gather data that we can use
 
06:11:07.708 --> 06:11:07.718 align:start position:0%
over time if the state is looking at
 
06:11:09.830 --> 06:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
different ways to heat a building and
 
06:11:11.270 --> 06:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
they looked at a heat pump they would
 
06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
have to look at the carbon price
 
06:11:15.310 --> 06:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
attached to electrification and then you
 
06:11:18.468 --> 06:11:18.478 align:start position:0%
would just look at again what is the
 
06:11:21.070 --> 06:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
cost efficient
 
06:11:23.990 --> 06:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
decision yeah yeah I I don't know maybe
 
06:11:26.070 --> 06:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
insulating the house more would help or
 
06:11:28.270 --> 06:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
something on on that order new window so
 
06:11:30.910 --> 06:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
your air doesn't come in but whatever
 
06:11:33.230 --> 06:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
heat pump is perfectly fine it has good
 
06:11:35.708 --> 06:11:35.718 align:start position:0%
heat no problem
 
06:11:38.310 --> 06:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that Jackie agrees with
 
06:11:40.788 --> 06:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
that statement but no no I do I do I
 
06:11:45.230 --> 06:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
just that I feel like we're talking
 
06:11:47.788 --> 06:11:47.798 align:start position:0%
about we're not talking about existing
 
06:11:51.750 --> 06:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
things because we're talking
 
06:11:55.150 --> 06:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
about things that the state would would
 
06:11:59.110 --> 06:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
purchase that require energy and they
 
06:12:01.708 --> 06:12:01.718 align:start position:0%
can purchase whatever they want all
 
06:12:03.910 --> 06:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing is going to be creating a
 
06:12:08.110 --> 06:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
database that says yes you know if they
 
06:12:11.430 --> 06:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
had if this if this had been considered
 
06:12:14.310 --> 06:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
this would be the cost and maybe we're
 
06:12:16.910 --> 06:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
going to find out that that that system
 
06:12:19.750 --> 06:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
let's just let's just say for
 
06:12:24.110 --> 06:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
example you buy a car that runs on uh
 
06:12:27.510 --> 06:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
gasoline they buy a car runs on
 
06:12:33.270 --> 06:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
diesel and and then in the in the non
 
06:12:36.510 --> 06:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
non-mandated uh column they have a car
 
06:12:38.788 --> 06:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
that that's a hybrid let's just let's
 
06:12:42.670 --> 06:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
just use those examples okay so how much
 
06:12:45.708 --> 06:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
is the car that runs on gas cost how
 
06:12:48.510 --> 06:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
much is the gas the car that runs on div
 
06:12:52.868 --> 06:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
cost how much is the hybrid cost right
 
06:12:57.190 --> 06:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
now long term if you were to look at the
 
06:13:00.670 --> 06:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
you know the price of gas is the same or
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
the price of
 
06:13:04.510 --> 06:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
diesel you know they have to look at the
 
06:13:07.868 --> 06:13:07.878 align:start position:0%
that which car was the most effective
 
06:13:09.750 --> 06:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
purchase at the
 
06:13:12.548 --> 06:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
time right so that and so basically
 
06:13:14.750 --> 06:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
nobody mandated the town to buy the
 
06:13:18.670 --> 06:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
diesel car but had they bought the car
 
06:13:22.430 --> 06:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
would that number be lower long term
 
06:13:25.990 --> 06:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
than the diesel car or the gas car and
 
06:13:28.708 --> 06:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
that be you can you can substitute a gas
 
06:13:32.390 --> 06:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
thing gas car diesel car hybrid car for
 
06:13:36.070 --> 06:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it could be a heat back system
 
06:13:38.350 --> 06:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
one with heat pumps one without heat
 
06:13:41.070 --> 06:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
pumps and one with you know I have no
 
06:13:44.548 --> 06:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
idea what so you know
 
06:13:46.868 --> 06:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
or um I'm trying to think of something
 
06:13:49.350 --> 06:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
else that runs on uh those those heating
 
06:13:51.750 --> 06:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
systems that run stuff on they run pipes
 
06:13:55.670 --> 06:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
under the ground radi yeah radiation not
 
06:13:57.628 --> 06:13:57.638 align:start position:0%
radi it's you know I'm sure you know
 
06:14:01.788 --> 06:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
what it's called where heat no it's you
 
06:14:04.670 --> 06:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
you send the oh Thermo Thermo when they
 
06:14:06.468 --> 06:14:06.478 align:start position:0%
run something down to the ground yeah
 
06:14:07.310 --> 06:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
they run
 
06:14:10.430 --> 06:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
ital geothermal yeah that's another one
 
06:14:13.590 --> 06:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
right so is that kind of thing and we
 
06:14:15.708 --> 06:14:15.718 align:start position:0%
and basically what we're saying is in
 
06:14:17.390 --> 06:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
the decisions that the
 
06:14:19.590 --> 06:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
state makes when they're buying
 
06:14:22.590 --> 06:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
something we want them to run this
 
06:14:26.868 --> 06:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
experiment based on what an alternative
 
06:14:29.150 --> 06:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
it could be that in the they decide to
 
06:14:32.708 --> 06:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
buy the hybrid car the gas the gas
 
06:14:35.868 --> 06:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
car and they put the diesel car in the
 
06:14:37.750 --> 06:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what they put in there
 
06:14:40.270 --> 06:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
right no that's right I mean it's how
 
06:14:42.350 --> 06:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
they designed the experiment that we're
 
06:14:44.350 --> 06:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
not going to tell them how to do that no
 
06:14:46.510 --> 06:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
all we want them to do is consider this
 
06:14:49.628 --> 06:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
experiment so that they can cons collect
 
06:14:52.990 --> 06:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
data Che well isn't the the purpose of
 
06:14:55.390 --> 06:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
it to try to figure out what the carbon
 
06:15:00.030 --> 06:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
footprint is no afterwards no no no and
 
06:15:02.150 --> 06:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
and that's why I was saying I I hope
 
06:15:04.070 --> 06:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
that would address some of your concerns
 
06:15:06.708 --> 06:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
because the bottom line is cost cost
 
06:15:09.070 --> 06:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
cost is is the driver here so another
 
06:15:10.990 --> 06:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
example trying to convert Co carbon
 
06:15:14.350 --> 06:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
footprint into cost our and I I like the
 
06:15:16.628 --> 06:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
idea of of uh Madam
 
06:15:21.310 --> 06:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
chair's example because our argument our
 
06:15:24.590 --> 06:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
bet if you will is that over the long
 
06:15:27.350 --> 06:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
term reducing our carbon footprint is
 
06:15:29.190 --> 06:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
going to save money right now that's
 
06:15:32.230 --> 06:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
debatable but that's but that but that's
 
06:15:35.510 --> 06:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
not what this bill does right so that we
 
06:15:37.990 --> 06:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
would especially if we amend it so that
 
06:15:40.390 --> 06:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
it is is gathering data so again 10
 
06:15:42.910 --> 06:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
years from now you and I could sit here
 
06:15:44.390 --> 06:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
and we could look at that 10 years worth
 
06:15:46.070 --> 06:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
of data and one of us could say to the
 
06:15:47.510 --> 06:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
other one C I was
 
06:15:49.990 --> 06:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
right all right so so what's the what's
 
06:15:52.548 --> 06:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
the calendar look like well how long are
 
06:15:54.910 --> 06:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
we going to run the experiment yeah well
 
06:15:56.510 --> 06:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should run it for in
 
06:15:57.750 --> 06:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
five years because I don't think that
 
06:16:00.190 --> 06:16:00.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to gather any data that's
 
06:16:02.390 --> 06:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
meaningful because first of all how many
 
06:16:04.670 --> 06:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
things do the state Buy number one
 
06:16:07.150 --> 06:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
number two how long do these things last
 
06:16:09.070 --> 06:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
know if it's a vehicle they last for a
 
06:16:11.350 --> 06:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
long time but the first five years of a
 
06:16:13.708 --> 06:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
vehicle they're pretty efficient and
 
06:16:14.990 --> 06:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
they they're you know they're not
 
06:16:17.030 --> 06:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
they're not falling apart so I think
 
06:16:18.590 --> 06:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
five years is a good
 
06:16:20.708 --> 06:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
number I mean that's what would the
 
06:16:22.948 --> 06:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
legislation look like though for for a
 
06:16:24.628 --> 06:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
fiveyear experiment they're going to put
 
06:16:26.708 --> 06:16:26.718 align:start position:0%
it in he's going to put it in in an
 
06:16:29.390 --> 06:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
amendment and we're going to look at and
 
06:16:30.830 --> 06:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
it would be so it there would be a
 
06:16:33.948 --> 06:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
sunset Clause be a study for five years
 
06:16:35.750 --> 06:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
well I I think what we would do because
 
06:16:37.670 --> 06:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
we can't bind a future legislature right
 
06:16:40.230 --> 06:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
so we would Sunset it and then in that
 
06:16:43.150 --> 06:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
last year uh if if somebody wanted it to
 
06:16:45.510 --> 06:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
continue then they probably would submit
 
06:16:48.510 --> 06:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
a bill maybe me uh for a study committee
 
06:16:50.070 --> 06:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
based and then you could use data that
 
06:16:51.750 --> 06:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
you would gather as the foundation of a
 
06:16:54.910 --> 06:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
sub as as a study committee uh but but
 
06:16:57.390 --> 06:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
what I'm suggesting is as as The Madam
 
06:17:00.430 --> 06:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
chair pointed out is that uh I we can
 
06:17:03.190 --> 06:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
put a sunset clause in and then we have
 
06:17:04.468 --> 06:17:04.478 align:start position:0%
this as something that the state
 
06:17:07.350 --> 06:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
calculates but does not use as a part of
 
06:17:10.110 --> 06:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
its decision making what agcy would do
 
06:17:11.390 --> 06:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
this do you think Department of
 
06:17:14.030 --> 06:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
administrative Services
 
06:17:16.430 --> 06:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
Charlie and I think the other point is
 
06:17:19.628 --> 06:17:19.638 align:start position:0%
you know and I I I like uh Madam chair's
 
06:17:20.948 --> 06:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
example the other one I was thinking of
 
06:17:24.628 --> 06:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
is if you were to buy an HVAC system or
 
06:17:26.468 --> 06:17:26.478 align:start position:0%
a car either way right if you were to
 
06:17:28.110 --> 06:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
kind of do your own experiment and say
 
06:17:30.390 --> 06:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay well I'm I'm I'm trying to decide
 
06:17:32.270 --> 06:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
between these two right well you have to
 
06:17:35.510 --> 06:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
choose one let's say you choose one but
 
06:17:38.548 --> 06:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
you also kind of keep the records well
 
06:17:40.230 --> 06:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
what if I had bought that other heating
 
06:17:42.750 --> 06:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
system right and then you can compare
 
06:17:44.910 --> 06:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
five 10 years out five years out in this
 
06:17:48.150 --> 06:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
case right you can look back and either
 
06:17:50.548 --> 06:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
feel really good because you made the
 
06:17:52.310 --> 06:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
right decision or feel bad because you
 
06:17:54.708 --> 06:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
think man I'm losing money but so it
 
06:17:56.590 --> 06:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
would be like that right we're Mak
 
06:17:59.230 --> 06:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
making a a purchasing decision using the
 
06:18:03.430 --> 06:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
same metrics we currently use and
 
06:18:08.030 --> 06:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
keeping the you know the carbon proxy
 
06:18:10.868 --> 06:18:10.878 align:start position:0%
price as a data point that just for
 
06:18:12.990 --> 06:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
informational purposes so that as you
 
06:18:14.670 --> 06:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
said down the line perhaps there's a
 
06:18:18.070 --> 06:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
study committee that then can do what
 
06:18:19.868 --> 06:18:19.878 align:start position:0%
the original bill here intended to do
 
06:18:21.868 --> 06:18:21.878 align:start position:0%
but we would have data to base that on
 
06:18:24.468 --> 06:18:24.478 align:start position:0%
now would we think that Edna would be
 
06:18:27.150 --> 06:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
the monitoring
 
06:18:27.160 --> 06:18:28.270 align:start position:0%
the monitoring
come

06:18:28.270 --> 06:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
come
 
06:18:33.548 --> 06:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
me well I think members of they'd have
 
06:18:35.788 --> 06:18:35.798 align:start position:0%
to well we wouldn't have a study
 
06:18:37.868 --> 06:18:37.878 align:start position:0%
committee what we would have to do is
 
06:18:41.110 --> 06:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
after the two-year period if and we
 
06:18:45.670 --> 06:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
renewed it Das I'll speak to to um we
 
06:18:47.750 --> 06:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be this would be something that
 
06:18:50.830 --> 06:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
Das would could report to our committee
 
06:18:52.750 --> 06:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
after they've collected the data yes
 
06:18:54.510 --> 06:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
they would report it to us because then
 
06:18:57.070 --> 06:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
we could say we together the study
 
06:18:59.948 --> 06:18:59.958 align:start position:0%
committee because the reason why we are
 
06:19:03.590 --> 06:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
the reason why this bill is before us
 
06:19:05.830 --> 06:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
and not before science technology and
 
06:19:08.230 --> 06:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
energy is because it involves
 
06:19:12.030 --> 06:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
Das right and because it involves Das
 
06:19:13.948 --> 06:19:13.958 align:start position:0%
they would be the ones who could come to
 
06:19:15.670 --> 06:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
us and say we did the study committee
 
06:19:18.990 --> 06:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
and this is what we found right yeah I I
 
06:19:21.468 --> 06:19:21.478 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of of keeping it in
 
06:19:21.478 --> 06:19:22.948 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of of keeping it in
Edna

06:19:22.948 --> 06:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
Edna
 
06:19:26.430 --> 06:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay good yes so that we don't lose
 
06:19:28.390 --> 06:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
track of it right right okay I think
 
06:19:31.390 --> 06:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
that's good especially since this is a
 
06:19:31.400 --> 06:19:33.030 align:start position:0%
that's good especially since this is a
yeah

06:19:33.030 --> 06:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:19:37.150 --> 06:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
okay so I don't think that do we agree
 
06:19:40.150 --> 06:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
that we want um representative ger to go
 
06:19:44.150 --> 06:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
to OS and and draft this amendment and
 
06:19:46.628 --> 06:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
then do we want to look at it and meet
 
06:19:50.788 --> 06:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
again or yes okay so we're going to do
 
06:19:50.798 --> 06:19:52.468 align:start position:0%
again or yes okay so we're going to do
that

06:19:52.468 --> 06:19:52.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:19:58.310 --> 06:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:01.468 --> 06:20:01.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:04.070 --> 06:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
um we're meeting Friday morning but
 
06:20:05.670 --> 06:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's probably to that's a that
 
06:20:08.310 --> 06:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
different uh that's that's different
 
06:20:08.320 --> 06:20:09.110 align:start position:0%
different uh that's that's different
that's

06:20:09.110 --> 06:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:20:13.510 --> 06:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
on is it possible to meet can you have
 
06:20:15.788 --> 06:20:15.798 align:start position:0%
see if you can get the amendment by
 
06:20:18.548 --> 06:20:18.558 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning by thir oh no yeah get
 
06:20:20.590 --> 06:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
try to get it to us by
 
06:20:22.430 --> 06:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
Thursday right because we have a house
 
06:20:24.990 --> 06:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
session on Thursday and then we have an
 
06:20:25.000 --> 06:20:26.350 align:start position:0%
session on Thursday and then we have an
exec

06:20:26.350 --> 06:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
exec
 
06:20:28.270 --> 06:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
executive session that
 
06:20:31.948 --> 06:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
afternoon so we could meet before the
 
06:20:31.958 --> 06:20:33.150 align:start position:0%
afternoon so we could meet before the
executive

06:20:33.150 --> 06:20:33.160 align:start position:0%
executive
 
06:20:37.390 --> 06:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
session and let's try to do that I won't
 
06:20:39.788 --> 06:20:39.798 align:start position:0%
be I won't be here Thursday afternoon
 
06:20:39.798 --> 06:20:43.948 align:start position:0%
be I won't be here Thursday afternoon
you

06:20:43.948 --> 06:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:43.958 --> 06:20:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
won't

06:20:46.990 --> 06:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:50.270 --> 06:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay Nick you're g go get any
 
06:20:52.510 --> 06:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes and I'll have to ask them
 
06:20:54.750 --> 06:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
to add a 5year Sunset date that wasn't
 
06:20:56.150 --> 06:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
part of the original
 
06:20:58.590 --> 06:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
so doesn't take very long yeah that's
 
06:21:01.830 --> 06:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's the easy part and the report to
 
06:21:04.868 --> 06:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
provide the report to us to our commit
 
06:21:04.878 --> 06:21:06.548 align:start position:0%
provide the report to us to our commit
yeah

06:21:06.548 --> 06:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:21:08.788 --> 06:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
that attendance could be a problem
 
06:21:10.350 --> 06:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
because I would be missing and you'd be
 
06:21:13.310 --> 06:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
adding someone new ma Matthew would be
 
06:21:15.230 --> 06:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
added he would have the benefit of this
 
06:21:20.270 --> 06:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
discussion no I know okay so let me um
 
06:21:21.468 --> 06:21:21.478 align:start position:0%
but I can meet
 
06:21:23.510 --> 06:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
Friday okay well
 
06:21:26.430 --> 06:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
Friday mid Friday
 
06:21:29.190 --> 06:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
and I did also based on uh chairwoman
 
06:21:32.590 --> 06:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
Maguire's suggestion I asked OSS to tell
 
06:21:35.510 --> 06:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
me what kind of uh rule writing
 
06:21:37.868 --> 06:21:37.878 align:start position:0%
empowerment language is required uh I'm
 
06:21:39.948 --> 06:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
not you know my understanding was that
 
06:21:42.590 --> 06:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
if we instructed the department to do
 
06:21:44.750 --> 06:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
this that they would then therefore
 
06:21:46.750 --> 06:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
simply have to write the rules about how
 
06:21:49.350 --> 06:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
they do it uh the chairwoman said that
 
06:21:49.360 --> 06:21:51.230 align:start position:0%
