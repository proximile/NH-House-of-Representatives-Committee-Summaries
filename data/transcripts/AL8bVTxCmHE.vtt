00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everybody this is the
 
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 align:start position:0%
interim study committee on house bill
 
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
1229 we have been referring to it as the
 
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
school meals bills
 
00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'm representative Sue
 
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
Mullen from Bedford the chair of the
 
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee and with me at present our
 
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
representative Alicia Lucas
 
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve Woodcock and
 
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative Arthur Ellison good
 
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you two documents
 
00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
this morning that I want to draw your
 
00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
um I I think we'll actually put the
 
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
the cart before the horse and look at
 
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
the committee report first because I
 
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
think that the robust discussion that
 
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
might take place on the subsequent
 
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
information that we had to our vote last
 
00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 align:start position:0%
time we met uh
 
00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 align:start position:0%
is something that we're going to want to
 
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
have but I'm not sure that we will have
 
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
adequate time to do both so
 
00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 align:start position:0%
okay so you have all seen the uh
 
00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 align:start position:0%
committee report I will just review it
 
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
for uh the Publix consumption it says
 
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
the interim study committee on house
 
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill 1229 voted 5-0 on October 6 not to
 
00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
recommend further legislation pertaining
 
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
to the bill as written
 
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
the committee heard comments from
 
00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
professional organizations such as the
 
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hunger project the
 
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association and the
 
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and was privy to
 
00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
considerable research conducted by
 
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
Jennifer fore assistant director of
 
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
House communications Services regarding
 
00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%
actions taken by states with similar
 
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
demographics towards ending student
 
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 align:start position:0%
hunger consequently we do not feel any
 
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
additional study is warranted I'll
 
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
remind you that house bill 1229 was the
 
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
stud at the interim study to determine
 
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
if we needed a study of the study of the
 
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.290 align:start position:0%
if we needed a study of the study of the
study

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
so uh we're we're back to Ground Zero
 
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.210 align:start position:0%
so uh we're we're back to Ground Zero
again

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 align:start position:0%
however the committee does recognize
 
00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
that addressing student hunger is both
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
important and necessary
 
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
future legislation regarding how to
 
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 align:start position:0%
increase the participation of eligible
 
00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
families funding mechanisms accessing
 
00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
maximum federal dollars available and
 
00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
implementing measures already instituted
 
00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
by states with similar demographics such
 
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
as Maine Vermont New Mexico Delaware and
 
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
West Virginia should be considered
 
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
I uh intend upon entering this report on
 
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
behalf of the committee uh if anybody
 
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
has any objections speak them now or
 
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
forever hold your peace
 
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a question as regarding
 
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
the report I support the work you've
 
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
done uh it's been terrific and you've
 
00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
done a super job in this committee as
 
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 align:start position:0%
well as the support from uh Kelly and
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
doe uh and Jennifer my my question is
 
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
just my understanding uh in the second
 
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
paragraph when you're talking about the
 
00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
the things that percolated out of the
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
dialogue over the multiple meetings you
 
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
had so
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
all of those issues then would be the
 
00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the next legislature
 
00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
for people to bring in legislation that
 
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
may be appropriate to those particular
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
issues but the report that we're
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
submitting uh now that we were on the
 
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
last minute is no for any more study but
 
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
rather now it's up to the independent
 
00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
legislators to take actions that correct
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay thank you very much
 
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 align:start position:0%
you're welcome appreciate it
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
additional comments
 
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
all right oh representative fleckis
 
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
well done Sue thank you very much I
 
00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
appreciate your support
 
00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
um all right so without any objection
 
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
then I will submit this report on behalf
 
00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
to the second piece of information that
 
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
you have in uh in front of us our
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
friends at the doe Kelly Rambo being in
 
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
the audience this morning uh
 
00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
followed through on the request that was
 
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
made at the last meeting to look at what
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
the total cost to the state of New
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
if we fed every school-aged child every
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
meal and did not require eligibility
 
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
into the program so that's breakfast and
 
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
lunch for everybody
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
you have those figures in front of you
 
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
um with eligibility numbers as well
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
the bottom line here is that the total
 
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 align:start position:0%
cost to the state with no eligibility
 
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
requirements so to feed everyone would
 
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
be 111 million two hundred and fifty
 
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
thousand nine hundred and eighteen
 
00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 align:start position:0%
dollars and 80 cents now I don't know
 
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
about you but I'm curious about those 80
 
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
cents I want I want to know where they
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
came from and how Kelly uh was able to
 
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 align:start position:0%
come up with that exact figure
 
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
if in fact we looked at
 
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 align:start position:0%
just eligible
 
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
participants so we're talking about kids
 
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
who are qua who qualify for free and
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
reduce free or reduced lunch then the
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
cost to the state would be 654
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
822 dollars
 
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
so everybody's follow along with that
 
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
so this you know this is obviously this
 
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
is a data point that is necessary in the
 
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
discussion of School meals uh and in to
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock's point
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
future legislation legislation which
 
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
would be legislation that would be
 
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
written and submitted in the fall of
 
00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
2022 after we know who's been elected
 
00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:39.710 align:start position:0%
2022 after we know who's been elected
um

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 align:start position:0%
will have access to these numbers now in
 
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
a way that they didn't meaningfully
 
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
before now
 
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
and I certainly thank
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
the doe for the work that went into it
 
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
and uh I will take any questions or as I
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have Kelly Rambo from the
 
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
doe with us this morning if anybody
 
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
would like to hear from her just let me
 
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.909 align:start position:0%
would like to hear from her just let me
know

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock yeah thank you
 
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
madam chair you may be able to answer
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
this or Mr Rambo uh if you can't but I'd
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
be surprised if you couldn't uh
 
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 align:start position:0%
if the proposal in the future was to
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
provide uh lunches and breakfast for all
 
00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
student youngsters in the school uh how
 
00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
would we go about then filing for
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility for federal reimbursement
 
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
it's a great question I I I
 
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock despite your
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
vote of confidence do not have the
 
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
answer to that so I'm going to direct it
 
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
to Kelly Rambo who has already taken a
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
seat at the table
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
good morning Kelly Rambo from the
 
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Education thank you for
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
um the long of the short answer is we
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
can't so we need
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and just to clarify the the number
 
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
that is in front of you I did take the
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
free and reduced eligibility from 2122
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
to apply to those numbers so there is
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
some free and reduced in there although
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
the data is due to covid
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
um not as
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
um accurate as it as it could be so we
 
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
could do it for this year once we have
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
that data but we need a
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
a point to start with to be able to say
 
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
we have this many free students we have
 
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
this many reduced students we have this
 
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
many paid students and that's going to
 
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
be the determinator for our federal
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and we have to identify
 
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
those students based off of the um
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
direct certification that we currently
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
have or the free and reduced
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
applications process that we currently
 
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:03.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
material just then so
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
youngsters or families of youngsters
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
that are uh eligible for either free or
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
free reduced lines but still if this if
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
we went through that package that way we
 
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
still have to uh do some type of
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
paperwork and apply so the state could
 
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
get the federal funding to supplement
 
00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:26.459 align:start position:0%
the state costs that's correct okay
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
 
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.490 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
chair

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
other questions by members of the
 
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.389 align:start position:0%
other questions by members of the
committee

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.730 align:start position:0%
committee
yeah

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:36.740 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
well but representative luno we would
 
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:41.459 align:start position:0%
welcome a question thank you very much
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
um and and thanks for taking my question
 
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not on this um this uh uh interim
 
00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
study subcommittee but um I heard you
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned direct certification and that
 
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
was a tool that the the New Hampshire Ed
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
has and I was wondering
 
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I I what you meant by that
 
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
sure so that's the students that are
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
directly certified by DHHS snap TANF
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
along those lines that's that's a list
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
that's given to us from from Department
 
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services
 
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.650 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services
foreign

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:17.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid eligible students that does not
 
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
include Medicaid thank you so that was
 
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
the that's the direct certification that
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments for uh
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:47.339 align:start position:0%
all right unless the committee uh wants
 
00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:50.339 align:start position:0%
discussion amongst themselves and
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock I'm looking
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
towards you because I know that uh these
 
00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
numbers were requested by you earlier on
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
I have no further discussion I think
 
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
that the data she provided I appreciate
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
the fact she went back and we did
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
mid-current data which I know took a lot
 
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
of time and I I do wonder where that 80
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
cents come from it came from as well
 
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
um I noticed she didn't get to that 80
 
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
cents but
 
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
um I I would hope that the state uh
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
Regals the fact that they didn't provide
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for the Medicare
 
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
reimbursement which they could have that
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
slipped out of our hands
 
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
um beyond that I'm hoping that next year
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
that we'll be able to recognize the need
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
of feeding every single youngster in our
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
schools and uh anecdotally and as I
 
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
think I said last time speaking with
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
some of the elementary school now the
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
Middle School folks the number of middle
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
class kids who would be on that border
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh has increased and those kids today
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
again coming to school hungry uh and are
 
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
hungry because of the fact that parents
 
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:53.579 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money based on the way
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
the living circumstances particularly
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
Apple we are in the tourist area of
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
Northern New Hampshire so I think it's
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
our responsibility if we everyone around
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
this table who's been involved in
 
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
education knows the importance of the
 
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
nutritional development of the brand the
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
youngster and we can go right back to
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
Maslow's theory if you don't have a
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
place to live and you're hungry you're
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
not going to learn now this is ancient
 
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a time that we do that
 
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:19.100 align:start position:0%
and I hope uh look forward to find
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors that will support that uh
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
next year so we can move that forward
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
other comments or questions
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
that did bring up a question and that's
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
where is the state going to come up with
 
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:43.860 align:start position:0%
a hundred and eleven million dollars
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
to pay for feeding every child breakfast
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
and lunch if I may respond I'm not sure
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
certainly well we're looking at
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
multi-millions of dollars for school
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
lunch we give it for I mean school aid
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
we're giving away right now under the
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
trust fund uh to Senate we keep kids
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
home and send them to religious schools
 
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
and we cut a hundred million dollars a
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars we cut out a
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
financial out of the trust fund to give
 
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
so that that hundred million we cut out
 
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
is a wonderful tax piece out of trust
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
fund to start the year could pay for
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
every youngster in this school district
 
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
every school district e so the money's
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
there representative this is the fact
 
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
that we have to determine how we want to
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
prioritize fee kids I think that's the
 
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative luno thank you very much
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
Madam Sharon don't don't forget about
 
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
the uh the 10 million dollars that the
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
state is giving to wealthy investors who
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
lost money in a get rich quick scheme
 
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
um it's the only state in the country
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
it's ever bailed out investors and uh
 
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
and uh you know hopefully we won't be
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
doing that again and that's 10 million
 
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
dollars that could go towards I think a
 
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
program with much higher should have
 
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.260 align:start position:0%

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
caucus right from the beginning here so
 
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
the individual saw you know positions
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
can be be communicated
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
um so at this point in time we'll go
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
into about a five minute caucus and then
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
come back and start trying to get
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
through these bills today these are
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
interim study bills as everybody needs
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
to know the the way you go on the
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
inter-study bill is you either recommend
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
it go forward or it's not recommended
 
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
for future legislation there's two
 
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
options and you can put some you know
 
00:32:54.169 --> 00:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
little bullets associated with each one
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
of those positions so but in large part
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
we have two options which we can go in
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.209 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:08.219 align:start position:0%

into the other and take make take a
 
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
motion from you uh I'll I'll just speak
 
01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
to the bill and just for clarity's sake
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Ladd
 
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
we did not recommend future action on
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
the bill because the bill itself was to
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
establish a study committee the
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
committee studied as you well know uh we
 
01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
we studied a lot from June until this
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
morning so the recommendation of moving
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
forward with the study committee is is
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's not recommended however
 
01:10:49.209 --> 01:10:49.219 align:start position:0%
we had fruitful
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
eye-opening conversations about student
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
hunger in New Hampshire throughout the
 
01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
process and the report does indicate
 
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
that there are a variety of topics that
 
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:03.900 align:start position:0%
should be considered for future
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
legislation uh primarily around
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility Federal funding how to
 
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
access federal dollars that kind of
 
01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:17.060 align:start position:0%
thing so we we support
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
eradicating student hunger
 
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
we just don't think we need to study it
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
anymore thank you very much you're
 
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.229 align:start position:0%

so with that uh if there's further let's
 
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
go ahead we can have also a discussion
 
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:31.140 align:start position:0%

01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:34.140 align:start position:0%

01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
I think yes representative Woodcock
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you under the further discussion I
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
just want to highlight the fact that it
 
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
became very obvious to us that during
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
the pandemic when there was food being
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
provided for all youngsters that there
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
was a better base of nutrition in the
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
schools and that we now see today with
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
youngsters back to school that the
 
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
significant need to feed all youngsters
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's the base for uh their
 
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
daily lives and I hope that uh if this
 
01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
if if re-election works that
 
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:33.780 align:start position:0%

for uh for some security issues uh for
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
um for school districts if uh if they're
 
01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
in fact to um to disclose
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
um uh uh their um their policies with
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
respect to um to classroom recordings
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
and observations so so it it you know I
 
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's probably very premature for this
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
committee to be recommending future
 
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
legislation uh given the really the
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
dearth of um of of formal testimony
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
during the um during the hearing and um
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
and I think this is the type of thing
 
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
that that the legislature should uh
 
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
should most definitely proceed with
 
01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
caution uh thanks Mr chair yes
 
01:16:56.770 --> 01:16:56.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr uh I think I believe
 
01:16:59.209 --> 01:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
representative luno misspoke uh there
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
was no OTP motion or vote of eight to
 
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
ten it was the motion was to send it to
 
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
interim study which it did it went to
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
interim study we had two sessions and
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee voted uh four to three
 
01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
to recommend uh future legislation
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
um just to rebuttal on that I I
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
mean we can we can double check this in
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
the I mean does the clerk have the the
 
01:17:25.630 --> 01:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
the bill file
 
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh I don't have that here but I don't
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
I've got February 24th an OTP motion was
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
made uh and if and the vote was eight to
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
ten on that I don't know if anybody else
 
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
has notes from the bill and I don't
 
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
believe I misspoke you can easily go to
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
the docket right but and y'all see that
 
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
if if this if this is a point of
 
01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
if if this if this is a point of
contention

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
contention
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
um then um
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah actually you're right we can go to
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh yeah yeah thank you representative my
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
recollection I don't have the notes Here
 
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
was that the motion that came out of the
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee was interim study no that was
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
the motion that came out of the
 
01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
committee but correct the
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
yeah previous motion had failed right
 
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
so the bill docket doesn't only reflects
 
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
the the past motions that's right okay
 
01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you but the but the bill file
 
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
so uh you know in looking at the nature
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
of what the interim studies bills we
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
have here obviously they're just going
 
01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:42.380 align:start position:0%
to go forward and be in in the calendar
 
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to probably see on a number
 
01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:47.540 align:start position:0%
of these things even no matter how we go
 
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
bills are going to come forward
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if we want to get into a
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
long discussion on this particular
 
01:18:59.570 --> 01:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
aspect right now or we want to move on
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm good yeah just move on okay
 
01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
so any further discussion so
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%

01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
I've had since I put this in I've had a
 
01:20:44.570 --> 01:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of opportunity to work with uh the
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
university system in fact I was doing
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
that on Wednesday Thursday and Friday
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
this past week at the trustee meeting up
 
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
at Plymouth State
 
01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
um and we we've talked about issues such
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
as diversity inclusion and Equity
 
01:20:58.800 --> 01:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
as diversity inclusion and Equity
um

01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:01.729 --> 01:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
providing university-level professors
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
with the freedom to teach important
 
01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
ideas and encourage critical thinking
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
among students is key to Freedom
 
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
economic prosperity and innovation
 
01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
and there are some issues which yes we
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
have to look at at the University system
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire as well as the
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
community college system New Hampshire
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
but they're not so much in this domain
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
as they're in other domains and
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
administration and how we're handling
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
some things there so
 
01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:30.140 align:start position:0%
um I I feel at this point in time that
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
this bill should not move forward and
 
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
that we should respect the academic
 
01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
freedom that we've provided to our
 
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
professors and with the understanding
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
that as with all issues issues that may
 
01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
be controversial we want to have open
 
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
and open discussion and debate within
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
the classroom
 
01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:53.340 align:start position:0%

the Cooperative school districts

01:23:38.209 --> 01:23:38.219 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts no secret
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
that that's the case we have an active
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
case right now up in Carroll uh that's
 
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
going on we've have others as well where
 
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
the tuition rates of uh within that
 
01:23:54.890 --> 01:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
those cooperatives are very Divergent in
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
the amount of money which they're
 
01:23:58.010 --> 01:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
spending in Carol spending what forty
 
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
six thousand dollars per pupil per year
 
01:24:03.890 --> 01:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
whereas others within that particular
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
District are spending much much much
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
less down in the 9000 plus dollars
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
so there is there's uh that issue that
 
01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
they have and they've gone three times
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
through the process all the way through
 
01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:19.460 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
appealing the decisions seeing that they
 
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
don't have the votes of course to get
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
out and they're trying to figure out how
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
they can do that and so they can work
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
towards trying to find an environment
 
01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:32.219 align:start position:0%
which is more satisfactory to themselves
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
up there in Carrollton
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
that's not unique to the state though so
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
it's a huge huge issue in terms of
 
01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
disillusionment into the original
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
articles or agreement which may have
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
been made back in the 1960s and since uh
 
01:24:51.649 --> 01:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
really I haven't changed in accordance
 
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
with the demographic within the
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
community the population student
 
01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
population or the value of property
 
01:24:59.630 --> 01:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
within the community in that particular
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District
 
01:25:05.209 --> 01:25:05.219 align:start position:0%
uh there's uh a number of those issues
 
01:25:07.130 --> 01:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
where people are saying well now things
 
01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
have changed but our agreements we can't
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
get them changed because we don't have
 
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
the votes on the co-op to change them
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh there's so many issues that we felt
 
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
that in terms of moving forward that
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
there is need to study this thing but to
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
do it in a way that is going to be more
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than we've done in the
 
01:25:25.679 --> 01:25:27.649 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than we've done in the
past

01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I myself from really
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
saying here we are kicking the can again
 
01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
because this is the structured
 
01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
organization of the state and we're kind
 
01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:38.060 align:start position:0%
of Trapped into some of this
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
and we also did that for the purpose of
 
01:25:42.649 --> 01:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
consolidating districts so we could
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
eliminate some of the costs of running
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
these districts that was definitely a a
 
01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:48.860 align:start position:0%
keen interest of the groups back then
 
01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
even though I was just a young kid at
 
01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
I I you know I I feel that there's uh
 
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
a need to study and we are reminded that
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
we passed legislation last year with any
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
Commission Now the majority of people on
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
the commission have to be elected folks
 
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
from the senate or the house
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
so if you have and you can't have a
 
01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
commission that's any larger than 15
 
01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:17.229 align:start position:0%
commission that's any larger than 15
folks

01:26:17.229 --> 01:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
I was reminded of that by Jennifer fore
 
01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
who brought that to our attention here
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
about a month ago
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
so with that said we are looking at a
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
motion to be made on that and I will
 
01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:35.699 align:start position:0%
recognize represent cordelli for emotion
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you for House Bill 1366 I
 
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
would like to move uh not recommended
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative Bowman made a second
 
01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
there so represent cordelli make your
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
other motion do you have any discussion
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh I think you covered a number of
 
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
points thank you
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:26:59.159 --> 01:27:00.649 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
yes

01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to make a point that
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that I made when we were
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
talking about this that we also need to
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
study the co-ops that are doing well and
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
to recognize that economy of scale is is
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
one of the issues with a lot of these
 
01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
small school districts in in the state
 
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that's why the co-ops
 
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
were put together in the first place and
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
that perhaps we also include in this
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
commission a study on what can be done
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
to help these co-ops come together and
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
stay together rather than all this
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
effort and energy being put into
 
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
breaking them apart yes that's the
 
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
conundrum we have
 
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
and we know that there are some that
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to disband they're happy the
 
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
way they are so that that's the problem
 
01:27:50.209 --> 01:27:50.219 align:start position:0%
that's the issue representative yeah
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
Rick thanks I'm um at your request I did
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
put together some draft language for for
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
these three bills and the common the
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
common part
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
um in in each of them is um is as such
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
the bill uh the committee recommends
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
further legislation to establish a
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
commission to study matters regarding
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts concluding
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
but not limited to articles of agreement
 
01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
withdrawal and dissolution joining in
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
formation funding best practices and
 
01:28:20.209 --> 01:28:20.219 align:start position:0%
operation and administration and any
 
01:28:21.770 --> 01:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
other matters related to the governance
 
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
of a Cooperative School District
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
yeah and those are the important topics
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
of which you know when you disillusion
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
you're also talking about all those
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
assets that are within how they divvied
 
01:28:39.129 --> 01:28:39.139 align:start position:0%
up and that's another tremendous issue
 
01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
where if there is a commission that
 
01:28:43.250 --> 01:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
moves forward somewhere along the way
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
here through future legislation
 
01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the folks that are on
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
that commission have a good
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of this area of fiscal
 
01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
management uh would be facilities now
 
01:28:59.149 --> 01:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
would be very important that folks like
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
that beyond that particular commission
 
01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
represent Myler did you also have a
 
01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:06.410 align:start position:0%
represent Myler did you also have a

01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I believe that after submission of
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
this bill the issue at hand was resolved
 
01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
uh between the family and the schools so
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the legislation is not needed
 
01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
Is there further discussion I you were
 
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:52.139 align:start position:0%

recognize representative cordelli for a
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
motion uh thank you Mr chairman I would
 
01:32:10.610 --> 01:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
like to move uh that this be recommended
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.649 --> 01:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
uh the motion is to move the bill
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.370 --> 01:32:27.380 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli would you please
 
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh discuss your your motion yes thank
 
01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:32.629 align:start position:0%
uh discuss your your motion yes thank
you

01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
um irregardless of a commission that
 
01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
will take at least a year into the end
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
of 2024
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from a Cooperative school
 
01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
district is I think the Crux of the
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
matter with Cooperative districts and we
 
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:50.540 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
not wait for another year and a half to
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
go by to have legislation for this this
 
01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
matter we have had 17 bills on
 
01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts in the past
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
four years there is clearly a a problem
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out and I would recommend
 
01:33:15.470 --> 01:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
future legislation on this withdrawal
 
01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:17.570 align:start position:0%
future legislation on this withdrawal
matter

01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
matter
 
01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
may I ask why you you've chose this bill
 
01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
as to move this one forward
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
um I I think it was similar in some
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
regards to 1366 but
 
01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
um I think that this was uh specific to
 
01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
withdrawal process I think there might
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
be some tweaks needed but I think it is
 
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
the basis for something
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
that we can put forward in legislation
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Mila
 
01:33:52.970 --> 01:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh I I will vote
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
against this
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
we've already had a conversation about
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
this earlier this morning
 
01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'm Mr chair you uh outlined the issues
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
very appropriately
 
01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
to the breadth of this particular
 
01:34:05.219 --> 01:34:06.470 align:start position:0%
to the breadth of this particular
problem

01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
and to take one bill and isolate it from
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
a full study
 
01:34:14.110 --> 01:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
to me would be inappropriate
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the problem that is
 
01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:19.739 align:start position:0%
there with co-ops but in order to solve
 
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
the co-op there needs to be a detailed
 
01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
study around this and this is just an
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
isolated way to try to deal with it and
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
I would have encouraged the committee to
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
vote against this motion thank you
 
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative luno thank you very much
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yeah I agree with what
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative Miler just said I think
 
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
um I think taking a position the
 
01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
committee to take a position that this
 
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
bill should uh should move forward
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
undermines the uh the the the entire
 
01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
premise behind having a um a
 
01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
comprehensive commission to study comp
 
01:34:55.970 --> 01:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
issues comprehensive to um uh to
 
01:34:57.649 --> 01:34:57.659 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts and and
 
01:34:57.659 --> 01:34:59.149 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts and and
obviously

01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
um withdrawal and dissolution being uh
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
being one of them but I think
 
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
recommending 1399 going forward is uh is
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
very much akin to uh uh to what another
 
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
bill we're going to take up which is
 
01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
1679 which would actually require all
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts to um uh to
 
01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:19.070 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts to um uh to
abandon

01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
abandon
 
01:35:22.729 --> 01:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
um so um uh so so
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
without with without being able to take
 
01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:28.699 align:start position:0%
into consideration thoughtful
 
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
deliberation among a broad base of
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I think does a disservice
 
01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:36.179 align:start position:0%
to every Cooperative School District
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
every family every taxpayer every
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
student in those districts and I urge
 
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
people to vote against the motion thank
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
you you know representative
 
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
we know
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
of all the years I've been here there's
 
01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
going to be a bill next year
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
God is what we do on withdrawing from a
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
and so I think this is the one really
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
need to go forward and really needs to
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
look at even though we have a commission
 
01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:09.179 align:start position:0%
we've had those for you know how many
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
times and this really needs to be looked
 
01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
at because there are a lot of schools
 
01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
trying to withdraw and they like you
 
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
said before they don't have the votes to
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
do it so we need to really look at
 
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
withdrawing from a co-op thank you
 
01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Mullen
 
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
um it's a question more than uh more
 
01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
than a comment um did we know we had a
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
full committee study session on these
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
Cooperative bills correct that's correct
 
01:36:42.610 --> 01:36:42.620 align:start position:0%
and did we not come out of that meeting
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
saying that we were all in agreement to
 
01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:49.820 align:start position:0%
a commission that would look at things
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensively without separating the
 
01:36:55.850 --> 01:36:55.860 align:start position:0%
bills into their individual parts and
 
01:36:59.209 --> 01:36:59.219 align:start position:0%
pieces that's correct so this represents
 
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
a change from what we did in that study
 
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
committee yeah I think that some of the
 
01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:05.090 align:start position:0%
committee yeah I think that some of the
change

01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
that's are some of the issues which are
 
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
giving folks to really look back at what
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
we did as a committee of the whole
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
is that I for one have also been
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
contacted by a district several
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
districts which have gone through the
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
appeal process twice
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
and still are coming up short
 
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
and they're advocating the they're
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
looking for an experience which is best
 
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
for the students in their District
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
and one of which they can afford
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
um so I know that we're going to have
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
these bills coming at us there are
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
Cooperative bills that are going to come
 
01:37:45.649 --> 01:37:45.659 align:start position:0%
at us that may perhaps not be already
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
filed but they they are in the the
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
process of being drafted uh these
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
districts are looking for some you know
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
answers now
 
01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.689 align:start position:0%

um

01:37:56.689 --> 01:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
and so I I myself support the the
 
01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
commissions uh these studies
 
01:38:06.169 --> 01:38:06.179 align:start position:0%
recommendation that a commission be
 
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
formed I think that's absolutely
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
imperative however on the other side we
 
01:38:12.530 --> 01:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
have the the districts which come forth
 
01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:15.179 align:start position:0%
and they're not a lot there's just less
 
01:38:18.410 --> 01:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
than a handful but they are needing some
 
01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:21.179 align:start position:0%
direction right now or some help
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
so I I myself am not opposed to putting
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
one of these bills forward I would not
 
01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
put forward the louder Bill uh 16 19 79
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
79 that just you know acts the whole
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
thing uh co-ops would be totally gone
 
01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:42.179 align:start position:0%
and I think co-ops as represent Tanner
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
said some are are functioning very well
 
01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
but others are not and I think as a
 
01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:50.270 align:start position:0%
but others are not and I think as a
legislature

01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
were responsible for trying to listen to
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
even those which are in the minority on
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
this right now that are having those
 
01:38:59.570 --> 01:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
problems so I'm not objecting to
 
01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
a bill coming forward in the future
 
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
which deals with
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
with the issues that they have and it
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
may even give more input and support to
 
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
a commission study which is imperative
 
01:39:12.169 --> 01:39:12.179 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
um school boards associations in support
 
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
of a larger study that we've talked
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
about numerous groups are I I think
 
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
that's the way to go but I also am
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
worried and concerns that maybe were not
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
able to address where we should be as
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative boam says 17 bills come
 
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a bill dealing with co-ops
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
just about every year that I've been in
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
this house I don't know if we'll ever
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
get resolution but I don't see any harm
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
in this topic being discussed and are
 
01:39:46.129 --> 01:39:46.139 align:start position:0%
looking at it and trying to find
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
maybe an Open Door somewhere if it's
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary or maybe fixing it
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
so that they don't want the door to open
 
01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
that they can in fact fix it internally
 
01:39:55.729 --> 01:39:55.739 align:start position:0%
on the local level
 
01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
many of them however are just not
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
successful at the local control issues
 
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
so I think there's time for
 
01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
some help from us
 
01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
so that's I'm trying to respond to what
 
01:40:10.729 --> 01:40:10.739 align:start position:0%
you asked yes we did do the committee
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hall but uh so just could I ask you a
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up question chairman lad thanks
 
01:40:19.370 --> 01:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
so the original Bill 1399 went to
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
interim study because it had ish it had
 
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.649 align:start position:0%
interim study because it had ish it had
issues

01:40:24.649 --> 01:40:24.659 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
so if we move forward or if you're
 
01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
proposing to move forward with uh with
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
legislation are we saying a new bill is
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
to be written what happens to the
 
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
language of 1399. I'm looking at the
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
title of that bill which is looking at
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
primarily at how to withdraw from equal
 
01:40:46.970 --> 01:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
op I understand for example we had
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
another bill that was put forth by
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
representative Litchfield as you recall
 
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
in her district there and we have that
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
that bill didn't go anywhere uh but it's
 
01:40:59.689 --> 01:40:59.699 align:start position:0%
it's more in the same lines and you know
 
01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
I I'm not interested in getting down
 
01:41:06.590 --> 01:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
into the discussion on on do I get one
 
01:41:08.689 --> 01:41:08.699 align:start position:0%
man one vote type thing from my
 
01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
districts and then we split the rest up
 
01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
in accordance that's that's that that
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
attacks the articles of agreement that
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
many districts have in place right now
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
uh some are strictly one man one vote I
 
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
believe that that was very close to what
 
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
they had up in in in Gorham
 
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the Shelburne area
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
however I do believe that by by moving
 
01:41:35.209 --> 01:41:35.219 align:start position:0%
and saying yes we are open to business
 
01:41:37.490 --> 01:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
and trying to deal with this topic that
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
this is the signal that maybe these
 
01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
districts that have appealed and
 
01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:42.590 align:start position:0%
districts that have appealed and
appealed

01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
appealed
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
and spent money on it and not come out
 
01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
successful they have concerns uh I'm I'm
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
all ears trying to listen to it I'm in a
 
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
co-op District where we're very happy of
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
course there's only one town in it and
 
01:41:56.330 --> 01:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
they're all seven at large so they would
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
be uh and that's a set they're all
 
01:41:59.159 --> 01:42:00.050 align:start position:0%
be uh and that's a set they're all
different

01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
so representative luno so thanks Rick
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
and I I appreciate that and I appreciate
 
01:42:08.930 --> 01:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
the fact that that uh there are a
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
handful of Cooperative school districts
 
01:42:13.370 --> 01:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
I I and I shouldn't I shouldn't say that
 
01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
that there are a handful in of towns or
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
pre-existing school districts within
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts that may um
 
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
may may have have certain reasons why
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
they're looking to uh to exit the um the
 
01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:30.179 align:start position:0%
co-op but uh again just like what
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative Baume said this is
 
01:42:33.609 --> 01:42:33.619 align:start position:0%
something that should be looked into
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
instead what we're recommending is
 
01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:37.189 align:start position:0%
instead what we're recommending is
taking

01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
future action obviously not not with
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
this bill but but future affirmative
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
action on policies that would uh would
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
Define how a um how how a division how
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
there would be a division of property
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
and liabilities should a um should a
 
01:42:56.090 --> 01:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
pre-existing School District you know a
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
town want to um want to withdraw from a
 
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
uh from a co-op and what we're what
 
01:43:04.129 --> 01:43:04.139 align:start position:0%
we're essentially saying if we're
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
recommending this for future legislation
 
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh as opposed to study is um is things
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
like um uh like Roman 3 online 26 of the
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
bill a pre-existing School District that
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
withdraws from or as part of a
 
01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
dissolution of a Cooperative School
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
District shall be paid by The
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District the
 
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
pre-existing School District's
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
proportional share of net Equity so so
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
if if if these Cooperative school
 
01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
districts had recently let's say
 
01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
um uh uh invested in in um in in school
 
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
buildings or other infrastructure it
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
basically puts the remaining towns in
 
01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
that District on the hook
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
to pay back the um the uh the
 
01:43:52.609 --> 01:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
withdrawing School District I think
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
these things deserve further study and
 
01:43:58.970 --> 01:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh and and thoughtful study involving
 
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
all the all the stakeholders and not
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
some sort of affirming policy action
 
01:44:06.649 --> 01:44:06.659 align:start position:0%
from uh from this committee saying oh
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
yeah this is this is Full Speed Ahead
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
with uh with this policy because I I
 
01:44:14.770 --> 01:44:14.780 align:start position:0%
think these these things have uh have
 
01:44:18.109 --> 01:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
significant consequences to
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
um to you know not only the withdrawing
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
District but the remaining
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
um I mean the withdrawing town but uh
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
but but especially the towns that remain
 
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
within the um the co-op District I I
 
01:44:34.609 --> 01:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
think it's a very dangerous move
 
01:44:38.090 --> 01:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh thank you
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
um over the weekend I had a discussion
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
with one of the principals from Carol uh
 
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and they were
 
01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:46.310 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and they were
um

01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
they've gone through the process
 
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
multiple times very recently up through
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
a investigation by the State Board of
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
Education into the whole process that
 
01:45:00.010 --> 01:45:00.020 align:start position:0%
they went through this last time
 
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
they're very distressed to hear that
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
we're might be doing nothing for another
 
01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:09.179 align:start position:0%
year and a half two years
 
01:45:09.179 --> 01:45:10.510 align:start position:0%
year and a half two years
um

01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
so I I think that recommending this for
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
um also sends a message to those towns
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
that do want to get out of their uh
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
Co-op districts that
 
01:45:32.290 --> 01:45:32.300 align:start position:0%
um we hear them and we want to help them
 
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
and waiting just uh for a year and a
 
01:45:39.410 --> 01:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
half two years we we want to try and do
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
something uh in the meantime there are
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
plenty of things that can be looked at
 
01:45:45.530 --> 01:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
in addition to the withdrawal process by
 
01:45:48.250 --> 01:45:48.260 align:start position:0%
uh by a committee but
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
I feel that you know we need to listen
 
01:45:55.609 --> 01:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
to those districts that do want to find
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
a different solution and Carol had
 
01:45:59.930 --> 01:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
already worked out agreements tuition
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
agreements with um to provide for all
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
their students at less than half the
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
cost of what they are currently paying
 
01:46:10.729 --> 01:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
in The Cooperative District so it's a
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
huge issue for them and in other
 
01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:14.940 align:start position:0%
districts as well and I don't think we
 
01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
yes represent Alexis
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
some questions
 
01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
so if we
 
01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:29.570 align:start position:0%
so if we
recommend

01:46:29.570 --> 01:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:33.179 align:start position:0%
yes are we just saying are we saying
 
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:35.820 align:start position:0%
this bill the way it was we want to go
 
01:46:37.609 --> 01:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
forward or just
 
01:46:40.729 --> 01:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
future legislation regarding how to get
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
out of a Cooperative School District
 
01:46:47.629 --> 01:46:47.639 align:start position:0%
as I stated at the beginning when we
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
talk about the concept of interim study
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
and the two motions we can make but
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's also those little bullets you
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
can put underneath trying to orient
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
where you're going and what you're
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
recommending for example there may be
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
under 13.99 a school district that or a
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
district within the co-op that wants to
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
get out and we don't want to take any of
 
01:47:11.209 --> 01:47:11.219 align:start position:0%
the net Equity that that we have in that
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
other building we don't want you
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
captured you keep it you don't have to
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
pay us a thing we just want out
 
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
there may be some special circumstances
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
where that is and that is a an issue
 
01:47:24.169 --> 01:47:24.179 align:start position:0%
that's happening in one of the districts
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
we haven't talked about here at the
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
table today they don't want anything
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
represent boom
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
thank you and one of one of the problems
 
01:47:38.990 --> 01:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
we have if you have a very little tiny
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
small school district that has very few
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
votes on whether or not anything gets
 
01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
done and the other two big districts
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
that this is a co-op with wants to build
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
this big gigantic new school
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
the one of the reasons they want to get
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
out of the school district is they won't
 
01:47:58.850 --> 01:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
don't want to be able to don't have the
 
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
resources to pay for that new big school
 
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the problems also and
 
01:48:07.729 --> 01:48:07.739 align:start position:0%
all of that can be even in this moved
 
01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
this forward the bills can all be also
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
be amended to be what we want anyway
 
01:48:15.169 --> 01:48:15.179 align:start position:0%
like we all we've done so yeah one of
 
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
the problems is a lot of these tiny
 
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
school districts can no longer afford to
 
01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
pay for those big schools the biggest
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
school districts decided to vote on and
 
01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's been an issue over the years
 
01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
further disrepresent Tanner
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
this is a question
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
um since the committee as the whole when
 
01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
we got through studying this we came up
 
01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:41.030 align:start position:0%
we got through studying this we came up
with

01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
um a recommendation is that also listed
 
01:48:47.930 --> 01:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
on uh whatever's going forward that that
 
01:48:50.050 --> 01:48:50.060 align:start position:0%
this bill was actually part of a
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole that that the
 
01:48:54.410 --> 01:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole recommended a
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
commission and not individual bills so
 
01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:57.649 align:start position:0%
commission and not individual bills so
that

01:48:57.649 --> 01:48:57.659 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:59.570 --> 01:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
um there's some record of that available
 
01:49:01.129 --> 01:49:01.139 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any objection to
 
01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
that uh it's it's fact it occurred uh
 
01:49:06.590 --> 01:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
the committee a whole recommended this
 
01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
however when we're taking action in the
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
this is not the direction that we would
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
be going and there's I think there's
 
01:49:16.729 --> 01:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
been a rationale or a perspective given
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
to why that motion would go the other
 
01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.770 align:start position:0%
to why that motion would go the other
way

01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
represent Mullen
 
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I'm not sure that
 
01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
I understand whether or not
 
01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative Leck has got an answer to
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
her question the question was if you
 
01:49:36.410 --> 01:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
vote Yes to move forward with
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
legislation is it this exact bill that
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
moves forward or is it the concept that
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
moves forward and what happens to all of
 
01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
the concerns and and questions that we
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
had about the original Bill thank you
 
01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh thank you
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
um I just I have some um
 
01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:03.410 align:start position:0%
um I just I have some um
previous

01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
um reports uh from
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
um committees on interim study bills and
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at one
 
01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:11.689 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at one
um

01:50:11.689 --> 01:50:11.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
HB 1652 teacher preparation for
 
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
mathematics scholarship program and the
 
01:50:21.250 --> 01:50:21.260 align:start position:0%
report was authored by Mary Gile
 
01:50:24.229 --> 01:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
and in her report she said talks about
 
01:50:26.689 --> 01:50:26.699 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill to recruit high
 
01:50:28.490 --> 01:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
school students
 
01:50:31.729 --> 01:50:31.739 align:start position:0%
she goes on to say however more work is
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
needed on this bill so I don't think
 
01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:35.169 align:start position:0%
needed on this bill so I don't think
that

01:50:35.169 --> 01:50:35.179 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:39.229 --> 01:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily has to be that bill
 
01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
um word for word as indicated in this by
 
01:50:49.490 --> 01:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
Luna yeah thanks very much Mr chair
 
01:50:58.129 --> 01:50:58.139 align:start position:0%
um just on this on this similar string
 
01:51:00.609 --> 01:51:00.619 align:start position:0%
that I think representative Lucas
 
01:51:03.050 --> 01:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
started here
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
what what what what happens today has no
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
bearing really on on what gets what's
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
what gets filed and I think we all you
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
know recognize that but but the vote
 
01:51:16.609 --> 01:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
that we take today
 
01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
um is is
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
particularly if it's a vote to recommend
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
it it is a taking a position affirming
 
01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
material you know Clauses in this uh
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
material provisions
 
01:51:32.990 --> 01:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
in this build particularly the one that
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
that I read off from Roman three with
 
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
respect to uh withdrawing uh
 
01:51:39.770 --> 01:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
pre-existing School District that
 
01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:41.570 align:start position:0%
pre-existing School District that
withdraws

01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
withdraws
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
um uh shall be paid by The Cooperative
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
school district for its uh Equity so so
 
01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's basically saying okay
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
we're affirming that I mean may not be
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
the exact language or or something like
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
that throughout it but we're affirming
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
these these material Provisions in the
 
01:52:05.570 --> 01:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
bill and and saying that that's okay
 
01:52:08.209 --> 01:52:08.219 align:start position:0%
um absent having a uh really hearing
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
from from what about the what about the
 
01:52:12.410 --> 01:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
remaining School District what about the
 
01:52:14.930 --> 01:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
remaining towns in that in that school
 
01:52:16.609 --> 01:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
district that are then going to be on
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
the hook to then raise their local
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
budgets to pay off a a town that that
 
01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
wants to exit what's going to happen to
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
them what's going to happen to their tax
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
rates what's going to happen to their
 
01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
credit worthiness if they're if they're
 
01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
going to have to bond this and I think
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of unanswered questions
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
associated with that obviously you know
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
a new bill would come forward may or may
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
not have these Provisions in it it'll go
 
01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
through a full hearing and and stuff
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
like that we'll probably get answers to
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
some of these questions but until we get
 
01:52:53.209 --> 01:52:53.219 align:start position:0%
answered until we know what where what
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
what what would happen to these um to
 
01:52:58.850 --> 01:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
these school districts or to these towns
 
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
who would be on the hook
 
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know why this committee
 
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
would take an affirming position on
 
01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
these policies well I don't think the
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
the nature of the title of this bill it
 
01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
says relative to school district
 
01:53:14.209 --> 01:53:14.219 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from a Cooperative School
 
01:53:16.129 --> 01:53:16.139 align:start position:0%
District so you definitely would be
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
looking at both situations you speak to
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
how is this going to impact those within
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
the district how it's going to impact
 
01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:23.149 align:start position:0%
the district how it's going to impact
out

01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
01:53:29.530 --> 01:53:29.540 align:start position:0%
what may be being proposed in a specific
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh bill that comes forward I would want
 
01:53:34.490 --> 01:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
to look at the condition and criteria
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
that there that that Bill's talking
 
01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
about so I I think what this is
 
01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
basically saying yes we understand this
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
is such a deep
 
01:53:46.609 --> 01:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
subject that we do need further work on
 
01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
and I hate to say study though we need
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
some really solid work done on this you
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
know it hasn't been successful up to
 
01:53:54.649 --> 01:53:54.659 align:start position:0%
this point other than what we chipped
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
around the side with Jim grenier's uh
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
particular group however we do have an
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
issue out to this nagging at us and I
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to slam the door saying we're
 
01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
not going to talk about this or we're
 
01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
recommending we not talk about it until
 
01:54:11.209 --> 01:54:11.219 align:start position:0%
after we have this study there may be
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
something comes to us that has some
 
01:54:15.169 --> 01:54:15.179 align:start position:0%
specifics in it and Criterion conditions
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
which address some of the concerns you
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned representative luno so I'm
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
open to you know having this this crack
 
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
so that we can you know send the message
 
01:54:31.010 --> 01:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
you know you know that we're we're
 
01:54:33.890 --> 01:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
involved with both the study and the
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
we're listening to your needs right now
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
and perhaps we may be able to help you
 
01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:42.109 align:start position:0%
and perhaps we may be able to help you
representative

01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I've got this
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
right because I've heard all these
 
01:54:49.250 --> 01:54:49.260 align:start position:0%
different opinions on what this means if
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
we vote Yes all we're doing is saying
 
01:54:55.090 --> 01:54:55.100 align:start position:0%
yes some legislation should come through
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
before and I think it's probably going
 
01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
to be closer to three years because we
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
already decided that a study that's only
 
01:55:04.250 --> 01:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
one year isn't long enough because
 
01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
that's what a commission because the
 
01:55:07.729 --> 01:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
last one was one year and so we were
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
talking two years
 
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
but then it would be the following
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
Year's legislation and so this is just
 
01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
all we're saying is yes in the meantime
 
01:55:19.729 --> 01:55:19.739 align:start position:0%
we should do
 
01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
something but not necessarily
 
01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
the concept represent Nelson
 
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have a question
 
01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
may seem silly but they live in a small
 
01:55:41.209 --> 01:55:41.219 align:start position:0%
town and we they want to pull out and
 
01:55:43.250 --> 01:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
let's say there's 10 million dollars of
 
01:55:44.930 --> 01:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
debt they owe now
 
01:55:46.609 --> 01:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
a couple years that they're willing to
 
01:55:50.090 --> 01:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
sit out pay off their debt and the towns
 
01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
decide the next year they're going to
 
01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
build this monstrous
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
new school are they required to have to
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
continue paying that or are they
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
forgiven for the new building that's
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
part of the question of what you're
 
01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
dealing with right now in one small
 
01:56:06.490 --> 01:56:06.500 align:start position:0%
village in this state
 
01:56:09.590 --> 01:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
and it's on the horizon and they're
 
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
looking for some assistance in trying to
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
better understand what you're saying
 
01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's a real issue
 
01:56:18.290 --> 01:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
they're basically locked in
 
01:56:20.290 --> 01:56:20.300 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
the debt that's in you know uh gotten by
 
01:56:26.689 --> 01:56:26.699 align:start position:0%
that new facility
 
01:56:29.330 --> 01:56:29.340 align:start position:0%
and see therapy okay thank you
 
01:56:31.970 --> 01:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock yeah
 
01:56:33.649 --> 01:56:33.659 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to go back through represent
 
01:56:35.689 --> 01:56:35.699 align:start position:0%
weeks the question could I must have
 
01:56:37.970 --> 01:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
missed your response I heard she had a
 
01:56:39.410 --> 01:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
pretty direct question to you and I
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
didn't hear the response
 
01:56:44.450 --> 01:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
the timeline on anything that we put
 
01:56:47.209 --> 01:56:47.219 align:start position:0%
forward if you if the a bill comes in
 
01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
you know it's not going to go in effect
 
01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
until the governor signs it in law if
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
that in fact even happens that's going
 
01:56:55.129 --> 01:56:55.139 align:start position:0%
to be next summer
 
01:56:57.229 --> 01:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
around that area then you put the
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
commission together and by the
 
01:57:00.169 --> 01:57:00.179 align:start position:0%
commissions put together you're probably
 
01:57:01.609 --> 01:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
in the fall
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
and you're now studying it on the second
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
year out
 
01:57:07.609 --> 01:57:07.619 align:start position:0%
um then it's going to be the third year
 
01:57:10.570 --> 01:57:10.580 align:start position:0%
where you have implementation if that
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
because there's going to be from the
 
01:57:14.089 --> 01:57:14.099 align:start position:0%
commission there's going to be statutory
 
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
change comes out of that and you're
 
01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
going to go through the process of
 
01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
another bill of sorts so it's going to
 
01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
be a a commission report is going to uh
 
01:57:25.970 --> 01:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
and and putting it all into works it's
 
01:57:28.129 --> 01:57:28.139 align:start position:0%
going to be I would say three four years
 
01:57:31.790 --> 01:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
out in front of us and these districts
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
some of them can't wait that long that's
 
01:57:36.290 --> 01:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
why I believe that we should be open to
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
listening to their proposals listening
 
01:57:41.570 --> 01:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
to legislation that comes in and
 
01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and try to assist them everywhere we
 
01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:46.550 align:start position:0%
um and try to assist them everywhere we
can

01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
represent Heath I see over there
 
01:57:53.149 --> 01:57:53.159 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair isn't it possible
 
01:57:53.159 --> 01:57:54.169 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair isn't it possible
though

01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
um in with an urgent situation that the
 
01:57:59.209 --> 01:57:59.219 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education has some
 
01:58:01.970 --> 01:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
authority over this
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent cordelli uh no
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
um I'd be glad to send you the uh study
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
that they just did or the investigation
 
01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
they just did into the withdrawal
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
process in Carroll
 
01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and their attempt to withdraw from

Co-op district and the and the uh
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation that they made in that
 
01:58:27.169 --> 01:58:27.179 align:start position:0%
last sentence it's basically throwing it
 
01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:35.930 --> 01:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
okay let's go ahead and and take a vote
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
on this right now uh the motion is on

you know leaving today that's 1680 and
 
02:00:04.129 --> 02:00:04.139 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take a five minute caucus

02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
which information
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
this if this is something that
 
02:01:02.089 --> 02:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
um that are uh
 
02:01:02.099 --> 02:15:10.069 align:start position:0%
um that are uh
um

02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.109 --> 02:15:12.119 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go ahead and we're going
 
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
to go on 1680 first
 
02:15:18.890 --> 02:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
and I Look to represent Lakers for a
 
02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:20.689 align:start position:0%
and I Look to represent Lakers for a
motion

02:15:20.689 --> 02:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
I move that we not recommend
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:31.250 --> 02:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
and represent Hobson second
 
02:15:33.649 --> 02:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
okay we have motion on the table to not
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
recommend that uh 1680 move forward
 
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
and second by represent Hobson uh
 
02:15:43.970 --> 02:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
represent Lakers do you have any
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
arcs any discussion
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
there are a whole lot of problems with
 
02:15:51.229 --> 02:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
this so
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.470 --> 02:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:15:59.569 --> 02:15:59.579 align:start position:0%
yes represent luno thank you very much
 
02:16:00.830 --> 02:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:16:02.569 --> 02:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
um so just for the record
 
02:16:04.729 --> 02:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
um uh we have filed uh language
 
02:16:07.490 --> 02:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
identical to 1680 to bring forward in
 
02:16:10.069 --> 02:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
this coming session I hope voters from
 
02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
all across the state recognize that that
 
02:16:15.229 --> 02:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
at least house Democrats are serious
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
about solving school funding problems um
 
02:16:20.689 --> 02:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
really important thing to note
 
02:16:23.870 --> 02:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
about 1680 is that it was a good faith
 
02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh attempt uh working across the aisle
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
with actually the governor's appointment
 
02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
to the school funding Commission in uh
 
02:16:34.490 --> 02:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
in developing all the provisions in um
 
02:16:38.509 --> 02:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
in 1680. most importantly it uh it
 
02:16:40.730 --> 02:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
focuses on closing student opportunity
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
gaps because when you close student
 
02:16:45.889 --> 02:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
opportunity gaps you're you're doing
 
02:16:47.690 --> 02:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
right by students you're doing right by
 
02:16:50.410 --> 02:16:50.420 align:start position:0%
kids you're doing right by families and
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
taxpayer fairness follows
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
follows that so um so you know in the
 
02:17:00.110 --> 02:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
nutshell when um when when when we're
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
going around knocking doors yeah there's
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues that I think um that I
 
02:17:07.129 --> 02:17:07.139 align:start position:0%
think voters from across the state have
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
on the top of their minds but top
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
priority of among the top priorities is
 
02:17:13.549 --> 02:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
property taxes what are you doing about
 
02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
my property taxes what are you doing
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
about school funding voters get it and
 
02:17:21.410 --> 02:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
um and Democrats get it and uh and
 
02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
that's something that we'll be bringing
 
02:17:23.399 --> 02:17:24.349 align:start position:0%
that's something that we'll be bringing
forward

02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:17:27.410 --> 02:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
um you know a major part of uh 1680 is
 
02:17:29.330 --> 02:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
also a meaningful property tax relief
 
02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:30.230 align:start position:0%
also a meaningful property tax relief
plan

02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
so so uh you know not only does uh does
 
02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:36.110 align:start position:0%
so so uh you know not only does uh does
does 1680

02:17:36.110 --> 02:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
does 1680
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
um uh improve opportunities for students
 
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
but it establishes a um a fair uh uh
 
02:17:46.310 --> 02:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
property tax rate that in any town
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
across the state wouldn't have to exceed
 
02:17:52.310 --> 02:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
five dollars per thousand so um so um
 
02:17:54.530 --> 02:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
you know if this committee wants to take
 
02:17:58.009 --> 02:17:58.019 align:start position:0%
a a partisan position against 1680 then
 
02:18:00.049 --> 02:18:00.059 align:start position:0%
uh then I hope uh I hope voters all
 
02:18:01.849 --> 02:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
across the state uh recognize that
 
02:18:05.330 --> 02:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:09.070 --> 02:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
represent Miler uh thank you Mr chair uh
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
this uh recommendation by the Republican
 
02:18:15.169 --> 02:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
caucus is indeed disappointing
 
02:18:17.929 --> 02:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
I shared with the with those of us that
 
02:18:19.730 --> 02:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
were here that were studying this
 
02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
an article
 
02:18:24.589 --> 02:18:24.599 align:start position:0%
that was printed in 1984.
 
02:18:26.810 --> 02:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
that compared the disparity between the
 
02:18:28.490 --> 02:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton school district and the
 
02:18:31.009 --> 02:18:31.019 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield school district
 
02:18:33.770 --> 02:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
that disparity has increased in the last
 
02:18:36.410 --> 02:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
40 years not decreased
 
02:18:39.889 --> 02:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
we had a uh we had a commission to study
 
02:18:41.690 --> 02:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
school funding
 
02:18:44.089 --> 02:18:44.099 align:start position:0%
that commission for the first time in 40
 
02:18:44.099 --> 02:18:45.410 align:start position:0%
that commission for the first time in 40
years

02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:18:47.389 --> 02:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
had an outside group that came in and
 
02:18:49.969 --> 02:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
looked at our data from school districts
 
02:18:52.610 --> 02:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
that basically said that the disparity
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
within the school districts is
 
02:18:58.370 --> 02:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
increasing not to decreasing
 
02:19:01.129 --> 02:19:01.139 align:start position:0%
we came up with a formula for the first
 
02:19:01.139 --> 02:19:02.030 align:start position:0%
we came up with a formula for the first
time

02:19:02.030 --> 02:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:19:05.389 --> 02:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
that provided a reallocation of current
 
02:19:08.330 --> 02:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
school funding not an increase in taxes
 
02:19:11.570 --> 02:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
but taking the current school funding
 
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
that provided a different way of
 
02:19:16.730 --> 02:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
allocating those resources to those
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
schools that are in need
 
02:19:21.349 --> 02:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
we talk about student Equity we talk
 
02:19:24.770 --> 02:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
about equal educational opportunities
 
02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
this bill provides that
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
we have more data now than we've ever
 
02:19:33.290 --> 02:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
had before when the original input model
 
02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
was created that basically said in the
 
02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
input model here's a same amount of
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
money for every student regardless of
 
02:19:41.929 --> 02:19:41.939 align:start position:0%
what the need is
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
what we're proposing here is a different
 
02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
way of funding schools that provides
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
equity for kids
 
02:19:53.090 --> 02:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
very disappointed we had hoped uh that
 
02:19:55.130 --> 02:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
we could have some bipartisan support on
 
02:19:55.140 --> 02:19:55.969 align:start position:0%
we could have some bipartisan support on
this

02:19:55.969 --> 02:19:55.979 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
because of the need across the state
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
and this is very disappointing from a
 
02:20:04.490 --> 02:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
standpoint of not recognizing the true
 
02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
nature of the of the uh the disparity
 
02:20:09.310 --> 02:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
that's there
 
02:20:12.770 --> 02:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
the inequitable opportunity for students
 
02:20:16.310 --> 02:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
across the state and um we will be
 
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
visiting this again next uh next session
 
02:20:21.469 --> 02:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
Big Time thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
very much representative
 
02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:25.969 align:start position:0%
very much representative
Lucas

02:20:25.969 --> 02:20:25.979 align:start position:0%
Lucas
 
02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
just very briefly I want to say that
 
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
putting more money to change outcomes
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
has been tried for decades and there is
 
02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
no correlation between money in and
 
02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
results out and so that is one of the
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
top issues here and yes we need to
 
02:20:47.450 --> 02:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
figure out something but this is not it
 
02:20:49.010 --> 02:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:51.650 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:20:54.170 --> 02:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair we just got through
 
02:20:54.180 --> 02:20:56.450 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair we just got through
discussing

02:20:56.450 --> 02:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
02:20:58.670 --> 02:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
um The Cooperative breakups and how
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's a handful of schools
 
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
that were sending a message that were
 
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
giving them hope
 
02:21:07.490 --> 02:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
and I'm just looking at the the lawsuits
 
02:21:10.730 --> 02:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
that we've had for over well a couple of
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
decades anyway about school funding and
 
02:21:15.950 --> 02:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
Newport a town that I represent right
 
02:21:20.929 --> 02:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
now Claremont Town nearby and I'm
 
02:21:22.910 --> 02:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the taxpayers in those towns
 
02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
and the students in those towns who are
 
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
suffering and that they're not the only
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
ones we know that there are many schools
 
02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
across the state we know this is a big
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
issue and we are sending a message that
 
02:21:37.250 --> 02:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
we don't really
 
02:21:40.610 --> 02:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
think it's a big deal and I think that
 
02:21:42.349 --> 02:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
02:21:45.290 --> 02:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
um put in in context of what we did with
 
02:21:47.809 --> 02:21:47.819 align:start position:0%
the Cooperative bill that that um we
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
recommended that I think we should
 
02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill to give hope to
 
02:21:54.530 --> 02:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
those schools and those kids
 
02:21:57.410 --> 02:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
and those taxpayers that are suffering
 
02:21:59.389 --> 02:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
under the current school funding process
 
02:22:01.730 --> 02:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I'm going to take
 
02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
one more
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
02:22:12.349 --> 02:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
um

02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:19.309 --> 02:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
I'm amazed that a bill of this magnitude
 
02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
that had commissioned study was
 
02:22:21.359 --> 02:22:22.550 align:start position:0%
that had commissioned study was
presented

02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
presented
 
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
with like a five-word
 
02:22:28.969 --> 02:22:28.979 align:start position:0%
answer is too much to take care of
 
02:22:30.410 --> 02:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
I would question the data that the
 
02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative is using when she said
 
02:22:38.330 --> 02:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
there's no correlation between money in
 
02:22:39.469 --> 02:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
and outcome
 
02:22:41.570 --> 02:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
you look at the amount of resources that
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
are putting it put into different school
 
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
systems and you look at the outcome
 
02:22:47.570 --> 02:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
there's clearly a connection and a
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
correlation between resources presented
 
02:22:52.849 --> 02:22:52.859 align:start position:0%
for children in schools then there isn't
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
you look at any of the data that talks
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
about the the income level and the
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
amount put forward by schools for
 
02:23:00.410 --> 02:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
students and the servers they can
 
02:23:00.420 --> 02:23:01.370 align:start position:0%
students and the servers they can
provide

02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
if you have a team that has one
 
02:23:03.359 --> 02:23:04.490 align:start position:0%
if you have a team that has one
basketball

02:23:04.490 --> 02:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
basketball
 
02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
and you have a team that has 20
 
02:23:08.090 --> 02:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
basketballs and 20 kids who do you think
 
02:23:09.530 --> 02:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
have a better opportunity to practice
 
02:23:11.690 --> 02:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
there's no different resources put in
 
02:23:13.490 --> 02:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
here and I'm sure representative Moffett
 
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
remember that because it comes right
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
along that same line uh is where are we
 
02:23:20.330 --> 02:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
going when we don't give equal resources
 
02:23:21.950 --> 02:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's what this is this is an Eco
 
02:23:24.290 --> 02:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
resource bill I was so happy to see that
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
finally something came that I was
 
02:23:27.650 --> 02:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
mistaken when I read the commission
 
02:23:29.690 --> 02:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
report and then read the pamphlet that
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
came on the commission report and then
 
02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
listen to the data from the dialogue of
 
02:23:35.450 --> 02:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
the year that all of a sudden now note
 
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
this is it we're not going to go forward
 
02:23:38.809 --> 02:23:38.819 align:start position:0%
we're going to go back to what we said
 
02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
was really important we need to be able
 
02:23:44.330 --> 02:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
to find a desk in a chair that's really
 
02:23:46.370 --> 02:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
important we only have those that's how
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to figure out how we're
 
02:23:49.250 --> 02:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
going to progress with school systems uh
 
02:23:51.050 --> 02:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
no forget about outcomes forget about
 
02:23:52.849 --> 02:23:52.859 align:start position:0%
achievement figure out what resources in
 
02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
so saying that that resources did not
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
support success is really not clear and
 
02:24:02.330 --> 02:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
it is a host of data between even things
 
02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
as simple as family income and resources
 
02:24:07.370 --> 02:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
and Student Success as the same with
 
02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:08.330 align:start position:0%
and Student Success as the same with
schools

02:24:08.330 --> 02:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
when you look across that the calendar
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
of every single town and the cost that
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
puts in purest child for the per diem
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
cost clearly is a connection between a
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
town that invests 42 thousand dollars in
 
02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
a town invests nine thousand dollars a
 
02:24:24.050 --> 02:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
resources for those kids so it clearly
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
is a lot
 
02:24:26.990 --> 02:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Moffett would

had a subcommittee we met twice on this
 
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh talked about in great detail
 
02:26:12.110 --> 02:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and uh voted four to three to
 
02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:13.370 align:start position:0%
um and uh voted four to three to
recommend

02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:13.380 align:start position:0%

Allison

02:26:22.929 --> 02:26:22.939 align:start position:0%
Allison
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
I was on that subcommittee I'm one of
 
02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
the three votes that against moving this
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
forward uh we've gone over and over and
 
02:26:32.399 --> 02:26:34.190 align:start position:0%
forward uh we've gone over and over and
over

02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
this issue uh in particular one of the
 
02:26:38.929 --> 02:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
things that stands out in particular is
 
02:26:42.770 --> 02:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
it's it's a program that would reward I
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
guess school districts a little unclear
 
02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill about how we would determine
 
02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
which school districts would be
 
02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
available for incentive grants but the
 
02:26:54.170 --> 02:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
basis here is we're going to give could
 
02:26:56.330 --> 02:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
give more money to those districts that
 
02:26:59.210 --> 02:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
are doing very well and we would not be
 
02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
giving money to those districts that are
 
02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
in need of of resources uh
 
02:27:08.450 --> 02:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
I I and as I said in the subcommittee uh
 
02:27:10.610 --> 02:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
I I'm done voting for bills to give
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
money to school districts that don't
 
02:27:15.010 --> 02:27:15.020 align:start position:0%
need it or have a lot of money already
 
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh I will only vote for Bill funding
 
02:27:20.389 --> 02:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
bills that will push money to the school
 
02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
districts that are in need of services
 
02:27:25.790 --> 02:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
for their students uh
 
02:27:27.889 --> 02:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
following note with with representative
 
02:27:29.929 --> 02:27:29.939 align:start position:0%
Moffett I mean this goes against his
 
02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
philosophy of sports which is that those
 
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.250 align:start position:0%
philosophy of sports which is that those
who

02:27:34.250 --> 02:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:27:36.889 --> 02:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
in the National Basketball Association
 
02:27:40.370 --> 02:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
the National Football League the teams
 
02:27:43.010 --> 02:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
that do worse get additional draft
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
choices and they're the first ones to go
 
02:27:48.290 --> 02:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
so the the issue there is that's where
 
02:27:50.570 --> 02:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
the resources should go they don't give
 
02:27:52.490 --> 02:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
additional draft choices to the Golden
 
02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
State Warriors because they won the uh
 
02:27:59.090 --> 02:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
NBA championship last year uh and I've
 
02:28:01.309 --> 02:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
made that point before so I I'm very
 
02:28:03.889 --> 02:28:03.899 align:start position:0%
clear on this one uh very disappointed
 
02:28:06.290 --> 02:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
if we move forward in a direction that
 
02:28:09.469 --> 02:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
is going to uh reward school districts
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
who are doing well and uncertainly I I
 
02:28:15.530 --> 02:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
represent uh two districts two school
 
02:28:17.330 --> 02:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
districts in my district that do well
 
02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
particularly well uh and might well be
 
02:28:23.090 --> 02:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
candidates for an incentive Grant but
 
02:28:25.370 --> 02:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
it's very unclear about what this thing
 
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
looks like what it should do uh and I'm
 
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to vote for moving
 
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
this bill forward thank you
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett they must share
 
02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
very briefly uh what we as I understand
 
02:28:39.650 --> 02:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
the process we don't want to get really
 
02:28:42.050 --> 02:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
prescriptive Here and Now on the exact
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
implementation of uh the the incentive
 
02:28:47.450 --> 02:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
Grant Bill the what we're talking about
 
02:28:50.270 --> 02:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
is I see it is per earlier conversations
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
today is the notion the concept of
 
02:28:54.650 --> 02:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
rewarding achievement and I'll go back
 
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
very briefly to the fact that we give
 
02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
money to third grade this goes with
 
02:29:02.630 --> 02:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
deficient third grade scores in in
 
02:29:06.530 --> 02:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
essence uh rewarding failure frankly so
 
02:29:09.290 --> 02:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
uh the the details the prescriptive
 
02:29:11.570 --> 02:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
details will will be worked out in
 
02:29:14.450 --> 02:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
whatever comes forward uh ahead of us
 
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you also that uh in
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
subsequent discussion there's been a
 
02:29:21.770 --> 02:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
some discussion about focusing strictly
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
on math
 
02:29:26.929 --> 02:29:26.939 align:start position:0%
so something that comes forward in the
 
02:29:28.490 --> 02:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
coming term depending upon who's in the
 
02:29:30.889 --> 02:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
mix uh the person the details will be
 
02:29:32.929 --> 02:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
worked on but I I and many others
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
parents you know we want we keep hearing
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
about trying to get more money more
 
02:29:39.410 --> 02:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
funding for Education here's some more
 
02:29:41.690 --> 02:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
funding for Education that's going to
 
02:29:44.570 --> 02:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
reward uh Innovation or successful
 
02:29:46.750 --> 02:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
Innovation results in achievement so
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
okay uh call call the role please
 
02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:55.510 align:start position:0%
okay uh call call the role please
representative

02:29:55.510 --> 02:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:58.030 --> 02:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
okay well I didn't see any hands up
 
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner my hand up
 
02:30:02.210 --> 02:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
02:30:04.969 --> 02:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
um I I take umbrage at the
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
um rewarding failure by giving money uh
 
02:30:09.469 --> 02:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
particularly for the third grade reading
 
02:30:09.479 --> 02:30:11.090 align:start position:0%
particularly for the third grade reading
program

02:30:11.090 --> 02:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
um I think what it does is it identifies
 
02:30:16.910 --> 02:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
schools that have a particular need uh
 
02:30:20.450 --> 02:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
more need than others uh for
 
02:30:20.460 --> 02:30:22.389 align:start position:0%
more need than others uh for
more

02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:30:26.690 --> 02:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
resources for reading and I think this
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
this is just the
 
02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
um whole Aura of this bill that we we
 
02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
um say to the schools that are having
 
02:30:38.929 --> 02:30:38.939 align:start position:0%
issues and we know that they are and I
 
02:30:41.389 --> 02:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
talked about how you know we're trying
 
02:30:43.309 --> 02:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
to give hope to these schools hope that
 
02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
there that somehow they the funding is
 
02:30:49.250 --> 02:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
going to change the resourcing is going
 
02:30:53.690 --> 02:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
to change and that they will have some
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
some hope that they can move on with
 
02:31:00.170 --> 02:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
their and improve student outcomes
 
02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
um and we know that it's a resource
 
02:31:06.170 --> 02:31:06.180 align:start position:0%
issue we we know that tremendously so
 
02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
um this the people that work at these
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
schools the students that are at these
 
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
schools that are in representative
 
02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
moffett's term failures and are getting
 
02:31:20.210 --> 02:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
rewarded are working very very hard
 
02:31:22.610 --> 02:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
they're working very hard and the
 
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
schools that are doing very well as as
 
02:31:27.530 --> 02:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
represent Ellison said and I represent
 
02:31:28.990 --> 02:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
02:31:31.490 --> 02:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
get their own rewards they get extra
 
02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
grants they get extra commendations uh
 
02:31:38.330 --> 02:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
they get teachers that are moving from
 
02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
from lower functioning schools because
 
02:31:43.270 --> 02:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
they have higher salaries they have
 
02:31:46.969 --> 02:31:46.979 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of benefits already so I
 
02:31:49.670 --> 02:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
just this is a slap in the face really
 
02:31:51.230 --> 02:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
to those schools that are struggling
 
02:31:54.290 --> 02:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:56.570 --> 02:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
representative whitcock
 
02:32:01.969 --> 02:32:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:03.469 --> 02:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
this this
 
02:32:03.479 --> 02:32:06.650 align:start position:0%
this this
is

02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
I can't think of any more inappropriate
 
02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:10.969 align:start position:0%
I can't think of any more inappropriate
than

02:32:10.969 --> 02:32:10.979 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:32:14.510 --> 02:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
seeing a need and saying we're not going
 
02:32:15.650 --> 02:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
to give it to you we're going to give to
 
02:32:17.570 --> 02:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
someone already is doing well
 
02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
when we have classes that are that are
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
at the lower level or the lower quartile
 
02:32:25.730 --> 02:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
and they're working to move up
 
02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
we're gonna move up and you say no we're
 
02:32:30.050 --> 02:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
not going to help you we know you're at
 
02:32:31.610 --> 02:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
the bottom and you're you know you don't
 
02:32:33.170 --> 02:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
have everything you need but we're not
 
02:32:34.309 --> 02:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
going to help you we're going to give it
 
02:32:36.050 --> 02:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
to the class that's doing really well
 
02:32:37.790 --> 02:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
let's give it the school is doing really
 
02:32:39.530 --> 02:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
well and give them more money on top of
 
02:32:41.510 --> 02:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
you down there just sort of suck it up
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
and keep on going
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
um I think that makes absolutely no
 
02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
educational sense at all if you said to
 
02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
the school it was down on the the bottom
 
02:32:52.910 --> 02:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know what you made great gains from
 
02:32:54.770 --> 02:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
last year this year you might get
 
02:32:56.690 --> 02:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
something well that makes sense thank
 
02:32:58.730 --> 02:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
you so much for more resources but not
 
02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
to say Oh no you're up top now we're
 
02:33:02.690 --> 02:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
gonna keep you there so if you're down
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
the bottom now we're going to keep you
 
02:33:05.990 --> 02:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
there too and we're going to do with
 
02:33:08.450 --> 02:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
taxes it just makes no sense to me to
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
give incentive dollars and I don't care
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
if it's reading scores math scores or
 
02:33:14.270 --> 02:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
anything and sent the money to school
 
02:33:16.570 --> 02:33:16.580 align:start position:0%
that is successful
 
02:33:19.130 --> 02:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
incentive when you threw an innovation
 
02:33:20.809 --> 02:33:20.819 align:start position:0%
that's a whole different ballpark but
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
what you said bill is incentive so I I I
 
02:33:28.849 --> 02:33:28.859 align:start position:0%
I have a total um uh concern that the
 
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
philosophy behind finding this is is uh
 
02:33:35.150 --> 02:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
poorly orchestrated
 
02:33:37.849 --> 02:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr briefly what I'm hearing
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
are a number of assumptions on how this
 
02:33:41.330 --> 02:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
is going to be implemented the the
 
02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
formula for implementation is TBD to be
 
02:33:45.650 --> 02:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
determined so these assumptions about
 
02:33:48.290 --> 02:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
that I'm hearing um are premature I
 
02:33:51.710 --> 02:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
think thank you okay I'm going to uh
 
02:33:53.630 --> 02:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
call this motion right now
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%

further discussion
 
02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
02:35:40.670 --> 02:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:42.770 --> 02:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
um been working on the background checks
 
02:35:46.969 --> 02:35:46.979 align:start position:0%
for a long time and I really feel that
 
02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
we need to have
 
02:35:52.490 --> 02:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
background checks for all people who are
 
02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:54.050 align:start position:0%
background checks for all people who are
particularly

02:35:54.050 --> 02:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
um you know what we control which is
 
02:35:59.389 --> 02:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
with taxpayer-funded money people that
 
02:36:01.010 --> 02:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
receive that under the guise of
 
02:36:03.650 --> 02:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
Education one way or the other
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
um all get the same background checks as
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
certified teachers do in public schools
 
02:36:11.870 --> 02:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
and those background checks are not just
 
02:36:14.570 --> 02:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
employee background checks but there are
 
02:36:17.650 --> 02:36:17.660 align:start position:0%
specific checks to to
 
02:36:20.090 --> 02:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
provide a safety
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
net around students from potential
 
02:36:25.929 --> 02:36:25.939 align:start position:0%
Predators potentials sexual offenders
 
02:36:28.429 --> 02:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
and by killing this bill not
 
02:36:31.309 --> 02:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
recommending it we have once again
 
02:36:34.250 --> 02:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
allowed these students to be
 
02:36:34.260 --> 02:36:36.050 align:start position:0%
allowed these students to be
vulnerable

02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
02:36:39.889 --> 02:36:39.899 align:start position:0%
um and I just I I
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
find it hard to believe that we can't
 
02:36:44.450 --> 02:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement about background
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
checks we do it for Camp counselors we
 
02:36:51.290 --> 02:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
do it in the health care field we do it
 
02:36:54.110 --> 02:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
for certified teachers we do it for bus
 
02:36:56.809 --> 02:36:56.819 align:start position:0%
drivers we do it for staff in public
 
02:36:59.330 --> 02:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
schools and if we're
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
spending money to send kids
 
02:37:05.809 --> 02:37:05.819 align:start position:0%
children out to other educational
 
02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities then those people that are
 
02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with those kids
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
in an in a situation where they're alone
 
02:37:15.770 --> 02:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
with them for any extended period of
 
02:37:18.590 --> 02:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
time rather than volunteering like we've
 
02:37:21.429 --> 02:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
we've know that it's already in statute
 
02:37:25.130 --> 02:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
and not do background checks I just I it
 
02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
it's just unbelievable to me that that
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
we aren't supporting that thank you
 
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh thank you uh
 
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's already being done law is not
 
02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
it's already being done law is not
necessary

02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair it is our
 
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure our children
 
02:37:47.870 --> 02:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire are as
 
02:37:51.170 --> 02:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
safe as possible and if we can take this
 
02:37:54.650 --> 02:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
one simple step to move forward to
 
02:37:56.750 --> 02:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
protect our children it's something we
 
02:37:59.450 --> 02:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
should do we have seen incident after
 
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
incident after incident of children in
 
02:38:05.630 --> 02:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
our non-public schools being perpetrated
 
02:38:09.469 --> 02:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
by someone who has a record and if they
 
02:38:11.150 --> 02:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
had had a background check that would
 
02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
have been picked up on and I'm sorry I'm
 
02:38:16.610 --> 02:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
not on education anymore but as a former
 
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
educator I find it very disheartening
 
02:38:22.910 --> 02:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
that this body would reject this kind of
 
02:38:24.050 --> 02:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
a concept
 
02:38:25.730 --> 02:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:28.610 --> 02:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to I have a question
 
02:38:30.410 --> 02:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
that's the last question go ahead I've
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
got a clarification question uh
 
02:38:34.010 --> 02:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli said it's
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
already been done in law we've got our
 
02:38:37.849 --> 02:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
attorney from the Department of
 
02:38:39.410 --> 02:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
Education right there I'd like to have
 
02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
her clarify if in fact he's correct
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me I didn't say it was being done
 
02:38:45.349 --> 02:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
in law I said it was being done
 
02:38:47.809 --> 02:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
well it's an implication I would assume
 
02:38:49.250 --> 02:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
you're saying that it's being done
 
02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:51.899 align:start position:0%
you're implemented there are things
 
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
there are things that are done in this
 
02:38:56.270 --> 02:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
state that are not in law
 
02:38:58.250 --> 02:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
well this would this would this
 
02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
particular bill would make sure that
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's done because it would then be in
 
02:39:04.969 --> 02:39:04.979 align:start position:0%
law that it would be done okay thank you
 
02:39:06.530 --> 02:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
very much on that with that we're going
 
02:39:09.770 --> 02:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
to call the role representative Moffett
 
02:39:12.050 --> 02:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
my name is here on the
 
02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
possible to get the clarification that
 
02:39:15.950 --> 02:39:15.960 align:start position:0%

he just indicated it had nothing to do
 
02:39:25.130 --> 02:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
with statutory law that it's in practice
 
02:39:27.250 --> 02:39:27.260 align:start position:0%
being done
 
02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
100 that the bill is that I'm I'm not
 
02:39:33.650 --> 02:39:33.660 align:start position:0%

would move not recommended for future
legislation

02:43:33.770 --> 02:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:36.720 align:start position:0%

discussion

02:43:45.050 --> 02:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:47.929 --> 02:43:47.939 align:start position:0%
um I I brought this um
 
02:43:51.469 --> 02:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
Bill forward because I
 
02:43:54.830 --> 02:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh heard what was going on around the
 
02:43:54.840 --> 02:43:56.030 align:start position:0%
uh heard what was going on around the
state

02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:43:57.410 --> 02:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
um in different districts
 
02:43:59.050 --> 02:43:59.060 align:start position:0%
um I thought it was
 
02:44:02.990 --> 02:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to help force the issue and
 
02:44:04.730 --> 02:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
not just keep
 
02:44:07.010 --> 02:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
um having
 
02:44:10.490 --> 02:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
bill after Bill year after year
 
02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:11.330 align:start position:0%
bill after Bill year after year
um

02:44:11.330 --> 02:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:14.750 --> 02:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think that there are approaches that
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
can be taken
 
02:44:22.150 --> 02:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
um in in a bill or dissolution but
 
02:44:26.090 --> 02:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
I recommend 1679 not go forward
 
02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:32.929 align:start position:0%
further discussion
yes

02:44:32.929 --> 02:44:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:34.429 --> 02:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
did somebody have a yeah it's
 
02:44:35.809 --> 02:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock oh
 
02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative I just want to be clear
 
02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
this this I don't want to screw this up
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is the bill that representative
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
cordelli brought in that we're going to
 
02:44:46.849 --> 02:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
shut down all all uh schools and by next
 
02:44:48.530 --> 02:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
July that we're
 
02:44:51.650 --> 02:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
um could I answer that
 
02:44:54.889 --> 02:44:54.899 align:start position:0%
Co-op is that the same boat seeing
 
02:44:56.330 --> 02:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli was the maker of
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
it representative cordelli uh this bill
 
02:45:03.309 --> 02:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
would um require dissolution by July of
 
02:45:07.010 --> 02:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
2025.25 okay it's not shutting down all
 
02:45:09.370 --> 02:45:09.380 align:start position:0%
schools um believe me just
 
02:45:13.130 --> 02:45:13.140 align:start position:0%
it was 2025 that all Co-op schools would
 
02:45:14.570 --> 02:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
be oh okay I wasn't sure I want to make
 
02:45:16.010 --> 02:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
sure that the structure would be gone
 
02:45:19.010 --> 02:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:21.530 --> 02:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
schools would still remain open
 
02:45:23.809 --> 02:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
02:45:25.490 --> 02:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
um further discussion
 
02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%

eligibility for state school building
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
eight I'm going to give the gavel to
 
02:46:27.889 --> 02:46:27.899 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli uh thank you and
 
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
I uh call on representative Vlad for a
 
02:46:32.929 --> 02:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
motion I recommend that this bill not
 
02:46:35.690 --> 02:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:37.750 --> 02:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
02:46:41.929 --> 02:46:41.939 align:start position:0%
uh represented the boom uh further
 
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
discussion um representative Ladd the
 
02:46:46.730 --> 02:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
issue of school building Aid is a
 
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
another issue which uh probably most
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
likely needs the attention of of us in
 
02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
terms of school building aid for all
 
02:46:58.370 --> 02:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
02:47:01.250 --> 02:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
however in this particular situation I
 
02:47:04.429 --> 02:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
am concerned regarding uh allocating
 
02:47:07.130 --> 02:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
School building Aid to in the amount of
 
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
30 to 60 percent based upon I don't know
 
02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:11.150 align:start position:0%
30 to 60 percent based upon I don't know
what

02:47:11.150 --> 02:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
um uh to a Charter Public School which
 
02:47:17.570 --> 02:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
does not have the
 
02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:18.469 align:start position:0%
does not have the
um

02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:20.690 --> 02:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
ability that a rigor school district has
 
02:47:23.090 --> 02:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
to set you know the property tax and and
 
02:47:26.510 --> 02:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
collect revenues and and and not knowing
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
what the the charter schools uh ability
 
02:47:32.389 --> 02:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
to pay for and continue in business
 
02:47:34.849 --> 02:47:34.859 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of issues a state
 
02:47:37.570 --> 02:47:37.580 align:start position:0%
board can and close them down quickly
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
the other point of uh that uh regarding
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
the Charter Public Schools is that
 
02:47:47.570 --> 02:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:47:49.730 --> 02:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm losing my trend of thought here a
 
02:47:52.429 --> 02:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
little bit and growing so fast here they
 
02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
can't the generating the leasing of
 
02:47:58.130 --> 02:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
schools is a concern
 
02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh so with that there's so many
 
02:48:03.349 --> 02:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
issues associated with this it needs
 
02:48:06.349 --> 02:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
some resolution and we have asked the
 
02:48:09.170 --> 02:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
department to look at this and to look
 
02:48:11.090 --> 02:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
at all School building Aid including the
 
02:48:12.230 --> 02:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
school building authority which
 
02:48:14.330 --> 02:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
represent a hill here chairs for the
 
02:48:16.429 --> 02:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
state how that interacts with the whole
 
02:48:19.550 --> 02:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
process so this must be done there for
 
02:48:21.650 --> 02:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
adding and going in another Direction
 
02:48:22.849 --> 02:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
we've got to make sure what we're doing
 
02:48:25.070 --> 02:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
is correct we're certainly on the funded
 
02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
in school building Aid when we see
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
applications in nature of 600 760
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars waiting out there of
 
02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
which approximately 40 percent of that
 
02:48:36.290 --> 02:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
or somewhere around 260 something
 
02:48:38.210 --> 02:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
million dollars in applications that
 
02:48:41.210 --> 02:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
we'd be obligated to as a state are
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
looking at and we're funding not even 50
 
02:48:46.670 --> 02:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year right now with uh
 
02:48:49.610 --> 02:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
our debt being paid off from that up to
 
02:48:51.290 --> 02:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars that's approximately
 
02:48:53.270 --> 02:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's about 25 million dollars each year
 
02:48:56.030 --> 02:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
for the upcoming biennium at least fifty
 
02:48:58.670 --> 02:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
dollars for 50 million for the biennium
 
02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
for new construction and new renovation
 
02:49:03.349 --> 02:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
done income close to touching what we
 
02:49:05.929 --> 02:49:05.939 align:start position:0%
need so there there are significant

famous you briefly uh this I actually

chaired in two different terms two
 
02:51:00.710 --> 02:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
different interim studies on this
 
02:51:04.370 --> 02:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
on this issue and this measure uh what
 
02:51:06.290 --> 02:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
we discovered
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
was that there have been improvements in
 
02:51:13.910 --> 02:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
the policies on campuses uh Kane for
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
example had earlier had a red
 
02:51:19.070 --> 02:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
designation from fire f-ire about a
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech on campus and they
 
02:51:23.150 --> 02:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
improved to operating with green UNH was
 
02:51:25.490 --> 02:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
yellow and is now green
 
02:51:29.750 --> 02:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
so we did not see the necessity for
 
02:51:34.190 --> 02:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
statute now that the campuses
 
02:51:37.130 --> 02:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
are have put in place satisfactory
 
02:51:41.929 --> 02:51:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:46.130 --> 02:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
