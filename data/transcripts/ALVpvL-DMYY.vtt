00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 align:start position:0%
so we are
 
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
slightly short of
 
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
a quorum I think there's no reason that
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
we can't have meaningful discussion
 
00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 align:start position:0%
given that we are a subcommittee rather
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
than a full committee
 
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.529 align:start position:0%
than a full committee
and

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to begin not by asking the
 
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role but by calling
 
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
the role myself in as much and insofar
 
00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
as I know who's on the committee and the
 
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 align:start position:0%
clerk May in fact not so figure it out
 
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
and so um in and then I'll have a
 
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
preparatory comment to make about
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
today's proceedings so calling the role
 
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
not present representative Merchant
 
00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:28.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon president
 
00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:33.259 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards yes
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative salloway
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
president I believe that is now we do
 
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
have some outside I think he named seven
 
00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
have some outside I think he named seven
people

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.180 align:start position:0%
uh did you mean to mention uh Dr Errol
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
maholland yes and he is not present but
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for him to be present uh
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
in that he is a clinician and I have
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
arranged to meet with him uh after this
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
meeting at his uh hospital to go over
 
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
the proceedings of so I'm just curious
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
because we have four of the seven
 
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
legislative members I wonder if that
 
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
constitutes a quorum since he's not a
 
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.469 align:start position:0%
constitutes a quorum since he's not a
legislator

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
if we hit four of seven then we have a
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
simple majority in a form
 
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:28.390 align:start position:0%
simple majority in a form
Catholic

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
represents always chair and with
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
committee's Indulgence understanding
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
that I obviously worked for an executive
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
branch agency not legislative but just
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
to be helpful that represent Mark
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
Pearson did appoint eight members to
 
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
serve on the committee uh represent
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
Betty gay might have been the additional
 
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
one I was trying to follow your um your
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
so that would be your number eight for
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
that so you under simple rules of a
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
committee Quorum that would be five of
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
the eight would constitute a quorum so
 
00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:02.459 align:start position:0%
so I have an exception that I'm flying
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
by it since you're an expert the eighth
 
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
person is a civilian not a legislator
 
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
the civilian is not here so the seven
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
legislators appointed to the
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
eight-person committee four of them are
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
here so four of seven legislators to me
 
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
would still be a form
 
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
I would not disagree with your
 
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
interpretation uh representative Edwards
 
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:28.019 align:start position:0%
on on that issue but if you're a
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
complete purist it is ape were appointed
 
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
to that so unless I I'm
 
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
respectfully it's um it's not even my
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
place to make this it's just trying to
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
be helpful thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh please representative Woods uh
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a difference whether it's a
 
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.190 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a difference whether it's a
committee

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
or a
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
um a commission commissioner uh I but I
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
mean um but it falls into that category
 
00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's very interesting
 
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
um does that change the flavor at all in
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
terms of consideration okay I'm seeing a
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
right to left a wiggle rather than up
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
again respectively for the record John
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
Williams director of legislative affairs
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
and because you are constituted by
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
virtue of your parent committee the HHS
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
ever say committee and there were eight
 
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
members appointed that committee the
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
same rules under Quorum requirements
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
right to know all those would still
 
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
apply to this subcommittee I would say
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
though if the issue here is being able
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
to proceed with less than a form you can
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
absolutely do that to hold a meeting you
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
just can't take any official action
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
either on minutes or specifically
 
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
emotions my understanding is that
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an intention to
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
reconvene perhaps for a short meeting to
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
take up the final recommendations
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
reported this committee at that time it
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
would be necessary to having a quorum to
 
00:10:58.009 --> 00:10:58.019 align:start position:0%
be able to vote on that but for today's
 
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
purposes you can do just about
 
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:01.140 align:start position:0%
everything else you would like to do
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
with the exception of actually taking
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
official actions um on on matters I hope
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's helpful
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I can only keep my fingers crossed
 
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.370 align:start position:0%
um I can only keep my fingers crossed
that

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
um somebody else will show up I'm hoping
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
that representative Merchant or gay will
 
00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:20.569 align:start position:0%
that representative Merchant or gay will
appear

00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579 align:start position:0%
appear
 
00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:21.290 align:start position:0%
appear
um

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
you have before you I believe everybody
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
has copies of the minutes of the meeting
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
of October 3rd
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
I would like to take a moment to
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
indicate that these minutes are
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
exceptionally complete and detailed uh
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
as per the efforts of uh councilor
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
Williams I'm very grateful to him I took
 
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
my own minutes I've merged my
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
observations with his and I think you
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
have a pretty complex complete set of
 
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
the minutes that's terribly important
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
for the record in that I believe that
 
00:11:59.449 --> 00:11:59.459 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
girl I don't want to call it testimony
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
the observations posited by
 
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative woods and representative
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
Merchant at our last meeting were simply
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
seminal in calling for
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
um a refocus of our deliberations on
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee
 
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.370 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee
um

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
and I am indebted to representative
 
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
Woods who was able to re-establish our
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
scientific basis for evaluating clinical
 
00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:37.019 align:start position:0%
interventions as the basis on which to
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
make a decision with regard to policy
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to propose later in this
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
meeting which it appears will be a brief
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
meeting I would like to propose a draft
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
resolution which if we don't have a
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
quorum we won't be able to vote on but
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
for an informational purposes I will
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
pass that around and we can discuss
 
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
whether this is uh appropriate for the
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
direction of the committee
 
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
prior that I would like to invite Peg
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
Clifford to address this subcommittee
 
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
I'll ask her to introduce herself I
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
would do to an inadequate job I think
 
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
but simply to say that she comes to us
 
00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:27.899 align:start position:0%
from the DHHS office of Medicaid it
 
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
specializes in pharmacologic issues
 
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
within Medicaid and I hope that she will
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
introduce herself tell us a little bit
 
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
about her background and talk to us a
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
little bit about what the Medicaid
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
related issues are with regard to
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
and I am the pharmacy director for New
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid so in that role I
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
review policies and procedures for the
 
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
coverage of medication and we have to
 
00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:08.150 align:start position:0%
coverage of medication and we have to
follow

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.110 align:start position:0%
follow
um

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:11.579 align:start position:0%
federal law and requirements to the
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
coverage of medicine medications so when
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
it comes to Precision medicine
 
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
the department does not have a um a
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
position on that right now but we do
 
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
consider each individual request for
 
00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:28.019 align:start position:0%
coverage on an individual case-by-case
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
basis and we look at whether or not the
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
treatment is deemed medically necessary
 
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
and that's done with Pharmacists and
 
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.509 align:start position:0%
and that's done with Pharmacists and
Physicians

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
Physicians
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
the trading provider along with the
 
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.949 align:start position:0%
the trading provider along with the
director

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
the medical director for Medicaid is
 
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
part of those decisions on the
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
case-by-case coverage
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
as far as coverage of individual drugs
 
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
there's a requirement under federal law
 
00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019 align:start position:0%
that if the manufacturer participates
 
00:14:59.689 --> 00:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
with the federal drug rebate program
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
State Medicaid programs are required to
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
cover that medication but we can put
 
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
coverage guidelines around it which we
 
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
do through prior authorization so
 
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.150 align:start position:0%
do through prior authorization so
um

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
we can look at the individual drug come
 
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
up with criteria that fits and put the
 
00:15:20.689 --> 00:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
prior authorization in place around that
 
00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:24.110 align:start position:0%
prior authorization in place around that
hello

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:34.389 align:start position:0%
are you
questions

00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know if that's on your
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
website somewhere about the you know
 
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
on the individual products with the
 
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.410 align:start position:0%
on the individual products with the
offensive

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
offensive
 
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.790 align:start position:0%
offensive
yeah

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if it's specifically on
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
the website we do have a drug lookup
 
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
tool on our website under the DHHS
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
pharmacy program Medicaid pharmacy
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
program you can click on the link for
 
00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
drug coverage and you can type in the
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
name of the drug and it will tell you
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
um whether or not the drug is covered
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not it needs prior
 
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
authorization and
 
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.250 align:start position:0%
authorization and
um

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
so the the DHHS website has the link for
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
both the FIFA service program in each
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:38.459 align:start position:0%
the critical issue for us is whether
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
a drug is federally approved
 
00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:44.459 align:start position:0%
and do we need prior authors
 
00:16:44.459 --> 00:16:46.310 align:start position:0%
and do we need prior authors
authorization

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
to fund the prescription of a drug or a
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
diagnostic procedure
 
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
Etc oh that's out of your bailiwick I
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
so you need Federal approval prior
 
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
author authorization and
 
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.130 align:start position:0%
author authorization and
um

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask Miss Clifford if you
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
will give us a word about uh the
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
presence of biomarkers as part of the
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
prior approval process
 
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.809 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
the biomarkers I don't know a whole lot
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
about it I know a little bit about it
 
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
there are certain of the newer high cost
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
um Precision drugs if you will that are
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
targeted to an individual
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
you would need to make sure that they
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
have the diagnosis and if there are
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
certain genes required to be present to
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have that individual
 
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
biomarker in order for the treatment to
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
have a potential to work and
 
00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:54.049 align:start position:0%
have a potential to work and
um

00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
there's a you know I don't know
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
um because we're speaking in general I
 
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
can't say the defectiveness of the
 
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:03.299 align:start position:0%
treatment because those are all
 
00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:07.909 align:start position:0%
treatment because those are all
individual

00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:09.710 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
do I assume
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
that in the search for appropriate
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
biomarkers it for a Medicaid patient it
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
would be Medicaid that would pay for the
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
screening to determine if the biomarkers
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
are present yes
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
can you give us any examples
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
of what the costs might be of the
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
diagnostic procedure to identify
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
biomarkers and then later the
 
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.730 align:start position:0%
biomarkers and then later the
appropriate

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:42.740 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
pharmacologic interventions
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
I don't have those costs available right
 
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.650 align:start position:0%
I don't have those costs available right
now

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
um I would have to look at because those
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
come in on a medical claim and my focus
 
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
is on Pharmacy claims but that's
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
something that we could look at and get
 
00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
back to you with
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
okay what about the cost of
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
interventions for precision medicine
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense of what some of
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
those drug interventions might cause
 
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
again you know it's it's based on the
 
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and and what the treatment is
 
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
and so I'm more familiar with the drugs
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
that come through on the pharmacy side
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the medical side but I do
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
I do know that
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
um when drugs are administered through
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
an outpatient or hospital we have to
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
make sure those codes are up in the
 
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
system we get notification and and make
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
sure we have those codes set to either
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
pay or pay on review you know so some
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
some codes can suspend
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
um so that we have that review to make
 
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299 align:start position:0%
sure determine the medical necessity and
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
others are set to pay and I talked about
 
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
prior authorization but that doesn't
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
mean that every drug out there requires
 
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
a prior authorization there's you know
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
some drugs do but not all
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
as you assess a protocol
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
or a drug and let us say and I
 
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
understand that you personally in your
 
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
office are not responsible for
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
um Diagnostics
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
you're responsible only for drug
 
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
interventions as a pharmacist hitting up
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
that part of DHHS
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
um is one of the criteria for
 
00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:37.690 align:start position:0%
um is one of the criteria for
authorization

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:37.700 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
the apparent effectiveness of the drug
 
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.710 align:start position:0%
the apparent effectiveness of the drug
intervention

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure on on that I think uh so
 
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is required to have a drug
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
utilization review board which we have
 
00:20:59.810 --> 00:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
um and that's made up of uh three
 
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
Physicians and three pharmacists that
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
are licensed here in New Hampshire
 
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
and we bring criteria to them for
 
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:09.740 align:start position:0%
specific medications
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
they review and then
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
um we also Medicaid also has a contract
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
with an independent medical review
 
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
contractor that has specialists in
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
different fields so we can ask them to
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
take a look our medical director also
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
takes a look and there is public input
 
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
in the dur process when we're reviewing
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
criteria for medications so the
 
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
manufacturers or Physicians anyone from
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
the public can speak to a drug that we
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
are reviewing
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
um those meetings happen about twice a
 
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.850 align:start position:0%
um those meetings happen about twice a
year

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
as you go through
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
the daily medical claims that come
 
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
across your desk
 
00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of the range of
 
00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:03.470 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of the range of
effectiveness

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 
00:22:05.649 --> 00:22:05.659 align:start position:0%
for the drugs that we wind up
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
prescribing under Medicaid
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know between what and what
 
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
is what we are likely to see in terms of
 
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
varies based on the drug class and the
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
and the diagnosis like for example we
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
can talk about hepatitis C there are
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
treatments for Hepatitis C that are
 
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
highly effective
 
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
um the treatments for Hepatitis C
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
initially had a very
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
um high price associated with them that
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
price has come down considerably over
 
00:22:44.409 --> 00:22:44.419 align:start position:0%
the last few years so initially we had
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
criteria that required
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
confirmation of the diagnosis and the
 
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
level of degree of cirrhosis that a
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
patient had at the time we had some
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
other questions that we asked around it
 
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
before we would cover the treatment and
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
over the years as the price has come
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
down and the treatment is highly
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
effective there we have lowered the
 
00:23:12.289 --> 00:23:12.299 align:start position:0%
barriers so now for uh individual newly
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with Hepatitis C we no longer
 
00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
require prior authorization if it's
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
their first course of treatment
 
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
if they need a second course of
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
treatment then we would
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
um then we have a prior authorization
 
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
are the I'm sorry I'm monopolizing this
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
conversation for which I apologize uh
 
00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:38.059 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to that in a few minutes
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
while I'm monopolizing
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
um are there other diagnoses
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
that come across your desk where the
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
treatment is less effective
 
00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:55.580 align:start position:0%
but still approvable
 
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
or the cost is extraordinary but given
 
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances we might have
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
proven anyway
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
that's loaded question I'm sorry yes
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
there there are so
 
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.789 align:start position:0%
there there are so
um

00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
you know there are uh well there was a
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
newer treatment for Alzheimer's that was
 
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
in the news quite a bit that
 
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.090 align:start position:0%
in the news quite a bit that
um

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
the clinical trials didn't show the drug
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
to be as effective as they had hoped it
 
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:29.900 align:start position:0%
um and so we do have prior authorization
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
requirements around that we have not or
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
my department has not received any
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
requests for prior authorization for
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
that treatment at this time and I
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
understand that the manufacturer is no
 
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.130 align:start position:0%
understand that the manufacturer is no
longer

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:43.970 align:start position:0%
longer
um

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:47.409 --> 00:24:47.419 align:start position:0%
uh I think they've backed off on
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
promoting that drug because it didn't
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
have a very high Effectiveness rating
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so are there other
 
00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:57.409 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so are there other
questions

00:24:57.409 --> 00:24:57.419 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:00.539 align:start position:0%
for Ms Clifford
 
00:25:03.409 --> 00:25:03.419 align:start position:0%
representative Woods oh thank you um
 
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question uh in your
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
prior authorization process do you still
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh use the outsort you mentioned some of
 
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of this is referred to
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
outs and is outsourced with
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
pre-authorizations is that also the case
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
so the effectiveness of the treatment
 
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't factor into our prior
 
00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:24.539 align:start position:0%
authorization if a drug
 
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
if the manufacturer of a drug
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
participates with the federal drug
 
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
rebate program we can put some clinical
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
guidelines around it but those clinical
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines don't really
 
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
um we don't have one that looks at
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the drug we really are
 
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:39.539 align:start position:0%
focused on whether or not they have the
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
disease that the drug is indicated for
 
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.789 align:start position:0%
disease that the drug is indicated for
and

00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:44.870 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
other if there's other specifics that
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
well if it comes to like a biomarker if
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
they need a certain Gene for that drug
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
to have the potential to work you know
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
then that would be something we would
 
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
look at because if they don't have the
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
gene that's necessary the drug is not
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
going to work and therefore they
 
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
wouldn't meet the criteria to receive
 
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:09.380 align:start position:0%
that coverage
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
getting back to the prior authorization
 
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
which is a significant significant
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
sticking point in the medical community
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
both Statewide and nationally
 
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:22.700 align:start position:0%
um again my question is do you Outsource
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
pre-authorizations uh for any of these
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
you know medications
 
00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
so it
 
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
if you're asking about who actually
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
reviews the prior auth for the Medicaid
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
fee for service population which is
 
00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
primarily what I'm responsible for we we
 
00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:43.100 align:start position:0%
have Magellan RX management as our
 
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy benefit manager the initial
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
review is done by them but we don't
 
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
allow Magellan to issue any denials if
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
they if they feel that a member doesn't
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria then it's sent to my
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
team myself and there's another
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacist that works for me at Medicaid
 
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:03.299 align:start position:0%
and we review and if we agree with the
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
decision the denial is issued by us not
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
by the um not by the vendor
 
00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:10.810 align:start position:0%
by the um not by the vendor
so

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:10.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
if I understand it correctly with a
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization uh it goes through
 
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.450 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization uh it goes through
pbms

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
pbms
 
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
to see if it's in their
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy formulary
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
and research criteria
 
00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:28.100 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't then it comes back in
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
in-house in the in-house
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
is then makes the decision that's
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
correct for the FIFA service population
 
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
what about the other non for the
 
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Managed Care organizations they
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
do their own review we we do review and
 
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
approve their prior authorization
 
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.510 align:start position:0%
approve their prior authorization
criteria

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
but the individual decisions uh whether
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
or not it's covered is up to each MCL
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
and the members do have an appeal
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
process and beyond that appeal process
 
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.690 align:start position:0%
process and beyond that appeal process
there's

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
um a state fair hearing that they can go
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
to and at that point
 
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
um it's reviewed by
 
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.730 align:start position:0%
um it's reviewed by
um

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I understand that this review process
 
00:28:26.409 --> 00:28:26.419 align:start position:0%
is pretty much like examining snowflakes
 
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
each each case is is pretty unique in
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
terms of of uh what the disease
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
condition is and and whether or not to
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
what extent the individual may have an
 
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
effective result
 
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
nevertheless I'm curious if there's an
 
00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
opportunity here
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
um to do an external Benchmark on
 
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
occasion to take a look at what other
 
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
states are doing in this area and and if
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity are we taking
 
00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
advantage of it
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
we do often
 
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.110 align:start position:0%
we do often
um

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
I'm part of a list serve for with the
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Pharmacy directors from the
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
other states and we often have
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
discussions about how other states are
 
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
covering it and take that into
 
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
consideration and a lot of times we
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
share our criteria from state to state
 
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
so there is not
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
a uniform Federal standard
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
and the availability
 
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
of a diagnostic procedure or an
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
intervention under Medicaid
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
could vary depending on where you live
 
00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
is that correct well the requirement to
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
cover a drug under under the Medicaid
 
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
Program is is the same the criteria from
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
state to K State can be slightly
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
different but we
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
oftentimes have very similar criteria
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
and we we share criteria with each other
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's an editorial comment a Medicaid
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
patient having to navigate
 
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
these kinds of procedures
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
to procure a treatment for a serious
 
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
disease I'm just
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
yeah wow
 
00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:36.860 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
a follow-up sir okay so this is uh an
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
editorial comment to your editorial
 
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
comment uh my my understanding would be
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
that it isn't the patient necessarily
 
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
that's doing the navigation of of this
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
procedure but it's care providers who
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
believe that this would be a good
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
treatment plan and then go through the
 
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
process to ensure that they can
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
prescribe it to their patient is is it
 
00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
more provider driven going through your
 
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
process or more patient driven you yes
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
you're correct it's more provider driven
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
so it's it's up to the treating provider
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
to request the authorization if a prior
 
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
authorization is necessary
 
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
and provide the supporting documentation
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
to show that the member meets the
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
if I might that's the nature of medical
 
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
practice right now part of the paperwork
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
and it's where the pickle comes in
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
that some of the pre-authors and
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization not just in this
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
instance but across the board for a wide
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
variety of you know medications
 
00:31:51.049 --> 00:31:51.059 align:start position:0%
procedures and Etc it creates a
 
00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
significant paperwork Trail and onus
 
00:31:58.810 --> 00:31:58.820 align:start position:0%
within the um any an individual office
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
and and has been shown I don't know the
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
frequency but pre-authorization is a
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
used as a mechanism to constrain Medical
 
00:32:09.299 --> 00:32:11.870 align:start position:0%
used as a mechanism to constrain Medical
Care

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative could you repeat that
 
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
last sentence please
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization process has been shown
 
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
on occasion
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
to be used by some entities which will
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
remain unnamed to constrain health care
 
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.970 align:start position:0%
remain unnamed to constrain health care
payment

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
payment
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
and coverage
 
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
I I just need to hold that thought
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
in my mind thank you
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
so further now it's gonna clarify but
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
okay you are saying that
 
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.169 align:start position:0%
okay you are saying that
pre-authorization

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
has periodically or or or or
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
sporadically been used to restrain
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
access to care and the costs but that
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:06.500 align:start position:0%
saying that there's a systemic abuse of
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
pre-authorizations no not at all I I
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
said I tried to clarify that that on
 
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:15.059 align:start position:0%
occasion right right I just wanted to
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
get our notes right yeah correct no
 
00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct this has been
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
just like some doctors have been shown
 
00:33:22.019 --> 00:33:22.930 align:start position:0%
just like some doctors have been shown
to

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:22.940 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
apply for uh Medicare Medicaid debt
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
coverage uh uh falsely
 
00:33:32.049 --> 00:33:32.059 align:start position:0%
um I mean it just it's one of the
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
difficulties that we face and uh when
 
00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:37.210 align:start position:0%
difficulties that we face and uh when
the

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:37.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization process uh it gets
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
trickled down uh to being outsourced and
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
then someone in Kansas uh who's maybe a
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
pediatrician may be making a
 
00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
determination for our company because
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
they're on a panel that reviews for that
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
company and they may be a pediatrician
 
00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:58.100 align:start position:0%
in Kansas
 
00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:00.539 align:start position:0%
making a determination on a surgical
 
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
patient in New Hampshire
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
that's a true Case by the way
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
so so I'm I'm sympathetic to your
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
observation I used to handle billing for
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
positron emission tomography back in the
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
good old days when I was still
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
clinically experimental and so each of
 
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
these was navigating an individual payer
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
and and I I understand what you're
 
00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:25.609 align:start position:0%
and and I I understand what you're
saying

00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative Kim
 
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:30.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
Has are has have we seen a number of
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
cases and if so do you know how many
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire may have been
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
brought forward to Medicaid for
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
consideration for payment
 
00:34:53.329 --> 00:34:53.339 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any numbers with me but
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
we could look at that and get back to
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
you we do have
 
00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:58.130 align:start position:0%
you we do have
um

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with the Department's
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh quality website there are I believe
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
there's a report on there that shows the
 
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
number of Prior authorizations and the
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
approval and denial rates for those
 
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.010 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.050 align:start position:0%
oh
follow-up

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
now I'm well I'm hoping that'll be just
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
be able to understand the scope as we
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
look at this issue is are we on the
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
early edge of things or is this
 
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to have to
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
take a look at in the future so for the
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
Precision medicine I don't know um that
 
00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
we have anything that separates out
 
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
those numbers I think in general we look
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
at all prior authorizations the number
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
of requests and approvals and denials of
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
those requests and
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
um one thing to to bear in mind when you
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
do look at the number of or percentage
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
of denials the the treatment may have
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
been denied for that particular drug but
 
00:35:59.569 --> 00:35:59.579 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that they didn't get
 
00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
another treatment so sometimes what
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
happens with high cost drugs is that
 
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
there's what's called Step through
 
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
therapy so before you get to the higher
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
cost drug you have to try this less
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
expensive treatment first so the high
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
cost drug might have been denied but a
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
lower cost alternative may have been
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
provided in its place
 
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
follow up representative Edwards thank
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
you I want to go back to the external
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
benchmarking and the listserv process
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
um okay so in my my experience when you
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
do external benchmarking you can find
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
that your organization is kind of in the
 
00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
mainstream where you can find that that
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
your organization is more aggressive or
 
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
less aggressive and and therefore
 
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
there's some correction process that
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
typically happens and the norming of the
 
00:36:57.359 --> 00:36:58.930 align:start position:0%
typically happens and the norming of the
standards

00:36:58.930 --> 00:36:58.940 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
intuitively where do you think New
 
00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is when we do external
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
benchmarking are we pretty much in The
 
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
Sweet Spot or are we you know lagging
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
are we leading what just what's your
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
sense uh that's something I'd have to
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
ask someone from the quality unit
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
um because they they are the ones that
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
look at all those performance measures
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
and and know where we sit
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
along with other states so that's
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
something we could get back to you on
 
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.670 align:start position:0%
something we could get back to you on
foreign

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
without meaning to add measurably to the
 
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
burdens of your daily work
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
um would it be possible to get some of
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
these data uh just send them to me via
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
email that I can distribute to the
 
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
committee yes
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
um I can I can access the reports that
 
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:53.099 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about that are on the
 
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
website and send you the link or I can
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
just download a copy and send them to
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
you whichever you prefer the link would
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
be adequate thank you for that or copies
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:05.900 align:start position:0%
gratefully received and we can get them
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
forwarded and or photocopied for the
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
committee okay
 
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
further questions from Miss Clifford
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
Ms Clifford I must say for somebody who
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
had to be coached in to testify
 
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
you have contributed significantly to
 
00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
our deliberations and I'm personally
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
grateful to you thank you all right
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
representative Woods
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me if I can offer a comment on on
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
benchmarking I don't mean this is
 
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
any kind of derogatory comment about
 
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
your what you're saying the difficulty
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
is with Precision medicine and we're
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
getting us back to the technical aspects
 
00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
is that that there are a wide variety of
 
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
parameters that come into play both uh
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
within the FDA the CDC and so forth in
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
recommending orphan drugs
 
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
um or other procedures
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
and that is on like we did with coveted
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines it was
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
um okay on an emergency basis because it
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
didn't meet the full criteria of the
 
00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
significant database
 
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so I I think as we go forward and we
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
look at the criteria used uh are they
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
using the English system uh in the
 
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
National Health Care system if they
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
still lose I think they do
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
um when they're um uh offering
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
um their um
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
okay on a drug they have two two
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
criteria one is safety which allows it
 
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
to be released if it's perfectly safe
 
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
but they don't have the numbers for
 
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.589 align:start position:0%
but they don't have the numbers for
efficacy

00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
efficacy
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh they allow it to be released for
 
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
General use
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
in the U.S one of the reasons that it
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
takes so long to get something because
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
you have to show safety and efficacy
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
as a consequence there's a significant
 
00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:03.970 align:start position:0%
as a consequence there's a significant
delay

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:03.980 align:start position:0%
delay
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
oftentimes getting it into the General
 
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.450 align:start position:0%
oftentimes getting it into the General
Public

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:07.460 align:start position:0%
Public
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
with orphan drugs the FDA has the
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
premature of offering the previous I.E
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
the English system of saying it's safe
 
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
and will release it under these under
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
the guise of this with certain criteria
 
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
and they become and those criteria then
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
become individualized
 
00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:27.770 align:start position:0%
become individualized
um

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
so as we go forward uh looking at the
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
criteria which is they say they you know
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
follow the CDC or FDA and all the other
 
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
criteria it may vary depending upon what
 
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
it is that they're dealing with I don't
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
mean to add complexity to this but it is
 
00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.569 align:start position:0%
mean to add complexity to this but it is
complex

00:40:50.569 --> 00:40:50.579 align:start position:0%
complex
 
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
um and um I just wanted to offer and I
 
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
cautionary comment
 
00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.589 align:start position:0%
cautionary comment
s

00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
right information so information is
 
00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:06.500 align:start position:0%
neutral it's just information
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh I just didn't want to step on anybody
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
until I said I want to make a comment
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
about benchmarking I just I I wasn't
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
trying to correct you or anything at all
 
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
if I just wanted to add
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
to what you said uh I I want to shift
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
gears here I believe we have no further
 
00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.349 align:start position:0%
gears here I believe we have no further
testimony

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
and therefore I'd like to move in the
 
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
direction of discussion this is because
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
we do not have a quorum this is not an
 
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
it is a working discussion
 
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
um for which we will take General notes
 
00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:44.579 align:start position:0%
but we will take no action in terms of a
 
00:41:44.579 --> 00:41:46.510 align:start position:0%
but we will take no action in terms of a
vote

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:50.540 align:start position:0%
the Prelude to the discussion however
 
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
comes with a review of our minutes
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh which depicts uh representative Woods
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
comments of our last meeting followed by
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Merchants comments in
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
that meeting which
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
this is a member of our committee who is
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
Senator we are currently in session I'm
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
afraid I can't talk right now but I must
 
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
warn you you are on speakerphone and my
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
microphone is open be careful what you
 
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.410 align:start position:0%
microphone is open be careful what you
say

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
drop it down told me now for two weeks
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
oh dear Sandra I hope you get better and
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
I will communicate with you when this
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
meeting is over
 
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:39.349 align:start position:0%
meeting is over
bye

00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.359 --> 00:42:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.650 align:start position:0%
um
we're

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.270 align:start position:0%
we're
we

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
in case nobody's noticed it
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
we have a surge of a new variant of
 
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
covet it's going on around us
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh we really haven't done a very good
 
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
job of identifying it and we really
 
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
don't know how effective vaccination is
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
in preventing it
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
however I am seeing individuals such as
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
Senator Guida who you just heard from
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
um who are in their second round
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
of acute covid and it appears to be a
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
pretty serious round of covet uh just
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
they'll notice now let me go back to my
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
comments so uh representative woods and
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant did a wonderful
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
job at our last meeting of refocusing
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
and they pointed out that
 
00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:38.099 align:start position:0%
if we abide by the criteria of proven
 
00:43:38.099 --> 00:43:40.510 align:start position:0%
if we abide by the criteria of proven
effectiveness

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
the specific topic before us of
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
precision medicine has not been subject
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
to the kind of clinical trials
 
00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:55.940 align:start position:0%
um not simply
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
the double-blind studies but not even
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
the case control studies or the cohort
 
00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:06.380 align:start position:0%
studies that would lead us to confidence
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
that this intervention though very
 
00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:11.770 align:start position:0%
that this intervention though very
costly

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:11.780 align:start position:0%
costly
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
significantly reduces the burden of
 
00:44:15.359 --> 00:44:17.530 align:start position:0%
significantly reduces the burden of
disease

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:17.540 align:start position:0%
disease
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
in following their testimony
 
00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:26.339 align:start position:0%
um I conferred extensively with uh the
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
chairman of Finance 3 who is sitting
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
here with US Representative Edwards with
 
00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the oversight committee
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson I spoke to uh
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh uh people on the house Judiciary
 
00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:46.619 align:start position:0%
Committee to see what our options were
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of of legal obligations I've
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
had conversation with councilor Williams
 
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.150 align:start position:0%
had conversation with councilor Williams
and

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
um have uh these consensus emerging
 
00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:05.540 align:start position:0%
that what our task is is not necessarily
 
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
to Simply review Precision medicine
 
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
but to create a task force of the
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
oversight committee a standing task
 
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.329 align:start position:0%
oversight committee a standing task
force

00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
force
 
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
to review emerging medical Technologies
 
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.589 align:start position:0%
to review emerging medical Technologies
and

00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
to assess these Technologies uh on a
 
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
continuing basis at the call of the
 
00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
chair of the task force so I drafted a
 
00:45:44.329 --> 00:45:44.339 align:start position:0%
very simple uh suggested recommended uh
 
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
action for the oversight committee which
 
00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:50.180 align:start position:0%
if this
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee approved and we don't have
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
enough a quorum to approve it but I'd
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
like to discuss it which we could bring
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
you had together which we could bring to
 
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.670 align:start position:0%
you had together which we could bring to
oversight

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
um as our final recommendation I'm going
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just so you know I'm I'm really
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
comfortable with us talking about a
 
00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:16.450 align:start position:0%
comfortable with us talking about a
draft

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:16.460 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I think we're as we're well
 
00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
within our guidelines to talk about a
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
draft and and and if we're making
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
suggestions that may
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
if if we're making suggestions that may
 
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
cause us to redraft a draft I I don't
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.619 --> 00:46:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
when you're ready I have some comments
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
on the draft
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
pursue it to this discussion
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
we will redraft
 
00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
and presented at our next meeting for uh
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
consideration assuming we have a quorum
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
please uh representative Edwards give us
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
your recommendations okay I I think if
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
if we're going to end up with an LSR and
 
00:47:29.089 --> 00:47:29.099 align:start position:0%
a bill that it it may be very useful to
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
have a purpose and intense section added
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
so that people understand what we're
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
doing why we're doing it you know as
 
00:47:37.809 --> 00:47:37.819 align:start position:0%
people who aren't in the Committees
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
won't have a clue so that that's one
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh then another for just
 
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.490 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh then another for just
clarification

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.089 align:start position:0%
clarification
um

00:47:47.089 --> 00:47:47.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
it reads now it is recommended that the
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
oversight committee submit to the House
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
and Senate companion bills which
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
establish a standing task force on
 
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
medical Technologies and for clarity I I
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
think you're saying that that task force
 
00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
should be within HHS oversight or are
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
you wanting it to be independent of HHS
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
or HHS oversight where where do you see
 
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:20.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.089 --> 00:48:29.099 align:start position:0%
I I think uh it it should be under
 
00:48:29.099 --> 00:48:31.730 align:start position:0%
I I think uh it it should be under
um

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
I think I'm going to let Mr Williams
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
correct me but I think it should be a
 
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:40.460 align:start position:0%
task force under HHS not HHS oversight
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh oversight I think is is is built more
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
around the notion of staying current
 
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
with what's happening and and and and
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
being basically the the guardian for the
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
public to make sure everything's going
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
well I think HHS is a policy committee
 
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
and as a policy committee uh this task
 
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:04.220 align:start position:0%
force would tend to come up with
 
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
long-term policy implications so so I
 
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
see it as fitting more comfortably as a
 
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
task force under HHS and not HHS
 
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.329 align:start position:0%
task force under HHS and not HHS
oversight

00:49:16.329 --> 00:49:16.339 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:49:16.339 --> 00:49:18.069 align:start position:0%
oversight
and

00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
would that include members of the Senate
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
as well as the house
 
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
I I think you can do joint
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know how you would
 
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
organize it then at that point that that
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
does complicate it
 
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:33.829 align:start position:0%
does complicate it
um

00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
the HHS oversight's already a joint
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
Senate house thing right so so I don't
 
00:49:41.569 --> 00:49:41.579 align:start position:0%
know if it's
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
um easier to do it under oversight
 
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
because we're already aligned to the
 
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
Senate as well but it's it's a longer
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
term policy issue
 
00:49:51.839 --> 00:49:55.490 align:start position:0%
term policy issue
chair

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
um representative Edwards is absolutely
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
correct in many capacities in his
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the committee
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
currently the committee already has at
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
least one existing other committee that
 
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
falls under it as a permanent committee
 
00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:11.579 align:start position:0%
but it's separate distinct as he points
 
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
out uh from The Joint legislative
 
00:50:17.569 --> 00:50:17.579 align:start position:0%
committee itself the example that is
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
cited uh was enacted back around 2015
 
00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:23.579 align:start position:0%
and it relates to a permanent committee
 
00:50:26.329 --> 00:50:26.339 align:start position:0%
under the HHS oversight committee for
 
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
dementia and Related Disorders and so
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
there is an example for you to follow
 
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
out there and it's actually codified
 
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
under RSA 126a colon 15 a lowercase a
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
and if you create a new entity which is
 
00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:41.579 align:start position:0%
what I believe representative Edwards
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
was quite correctly pointing out for an
 
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
approach it would be it would fall under
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
the umbrella of the larger parent
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
committee however it is separate and
 
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
distinct from that committee and would
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
have a reporting obligation back to the
 
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:56.579 align:start position:0%
larger committee on its signings and
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
recommendations so you do have a
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
template out there that's already in
 
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
existence and as you may recall the
 
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
underlying bill that was the predicate
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
for this uh this task force subcommittee
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
being created I believe it was HP 1280
 
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
you may want to double check on that
 
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
number but that bill actually
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
contemplated exactly what you were
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
recommending representative Edwards for
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
the creation of a permanent subcommittee
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
under our permanent subcommittee under
 
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
the HHS oversight and it gives you a lot
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
of your language what it may also
 
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
contain as well is the purpose and
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
intent language I believe that was
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
included in there as well however given
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
the work that's been done by this
 
00:51:37.609 --> 00:51:37.619 align:start position:0%
committee you may want to have your own
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
touch and to add your facts and findings
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
as well for the general report as to the
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
need for creation of the sub committee
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
under a permanent subcommittee under HHS
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
oversight so I hope that's helpful
 
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
I it it's very helpful
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
um the uh and I believe that the issues
 
00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.250 align:start position:0%
um the uh and I believe that the issues
of

00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
purpose and intent
 
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
and the creation of a
 
00:52:04.619 --> 00:52:05.290 align:start position:0%
and the creation of a
um

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:05.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
standing subcommittee are fine
 
00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
I'm always interested in the
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
implementation in that one would have to
 
00:52:19.809 --> 00:52:19.819 align:start position:0%
recruit members of such a task force
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh this is of course always the purview
 
00:52:26.089 --> 00:52:26.099 align:start position:0%
of the chair
 
00:52:26.099 --> 00:52:27.109 align:start position:0%
of the chair
um

00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
and it has been difficult certainly in
 
00:52:32.770 --> 00:52:32.780 align:start position:0%
this session
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
to recruit
 
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh members of subcommittees so that we
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
can get the work done please note there
 
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
are four members of the House present at
 
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
this meeting here today are senatorial
 
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
members are not represented here today
 
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons and we have
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
members of the house that are absent
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to pull this off and
 
00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
the only question in my mind
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative is
 
00:53:03.359 --> 00:53:04.150 align:start position:0%
representative is
um

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
whether we will be able to recruit to
 
00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.329 align:start position:0%
whether we will be able to recruit to
implement

00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
I just
 
00:53:14.569 --> 00:53:14.579 align:start position:0%
worry about that
 
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
okay just
 
00:53:20.089 --> 00:53:20.099 align:start position:0%
so the recruitment issue is there
 
00:53:22.849 --> 00:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
regardless of where we set this thing up
 
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
right so so that problem is just a
 
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.650 align:start position:0%
right so so that problem is just a
challenge

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.670 align:start position:0%
challenge
um

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
right now I'm just trying to focus on on
 
00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
where to place it I think Mr Williams uh
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
is uh suggesting very diplomatically
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
that maybe HHS oversight is the right
 
00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:42.380 align:start position:0%
way to set this up
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
as an aside it's a little disturbing to
 
00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:48.059 align:start position:0%
find out that there is already one of
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
these for dementia and Alzheimer's that
 
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
I'm just unaware of and I'm I'm the vice
 
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
chair of oversight I didn't know that so
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
so so what that makes me wonder is you
 
00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:03.140 align:start position:0%
know how did I get to be so ignorant or
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
alternatively has that uh committee that
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
task force become Obsolete and just quit
 
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
showing up for business and and if it
 
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
did then then what would we need to do
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
differently to not also build an auto
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
dying task force
 
00:54:26.809 --> 00:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
if I can build on your comments which I
 
00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:29.180 align:start position:0%
think are quite germane
 
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:32.579 align:start position:0%
we have Within
 
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether it's in within the
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
house or within the committee on Health
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
Human Services and elderly Affairs or
 
00:54:38.819 --> 00:54:40.730 align:start position:0%
Human Services and elderly Affairs or
oversight

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.510 align:start position:0%
oversight
um

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
task forces on specific issues that
 
00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
simply have not met
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
so even here
 
00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:52.970 align:start position:0%
so even here
um

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
I use the language
 
00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.049 align:start position:0%
I use the language
um

00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
I believe uh meet at the call of the
 
00:55:00.359 --> 00:55:01.430 align:start position:0%
I believe uh meet at the call of the
chair

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
a task words I don't care to mention it
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
because people will know who the chair
 
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.890 align:start position:0%
because people will know who the chair
is

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
um and the chair has simply not called
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
meetings of that task force and we would
 
00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
run the risk
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
of having a task force on the books
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
uh in the chair not calling meetings and
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
therefore the work not getting done the
 
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
other possibility that we need to think
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
when we talk about implementation is
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
when we identify the general category of
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
emerging medical Technologies it is also
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
possible that a task force could be
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
quite overwhelmed
 
00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
with the number of emerging medical
 
00:55:51.609 --> 00:55:51.619 align:start position:0%
technologies that require review
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
that were pertinent to the operation of
 
00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.809 align:start position:0%
that were pertinent to the operation of
Medicaid

00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:01.700 align:start position:0%
uh that might represent significant
 
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
costs to the state
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
and the task force would have to review
 
00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
any number of these and that's that's a
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
lot of work
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
so I'm concerned about the issue of
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
implementation how are you going to do
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
it make it work right and maybe that's
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
not for us to decide maybe that's for
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
the chairman of oversight to decide well
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
we're still making a recommendation
 
00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.130 align:start position:0%
we're still making a recommendation
yeah

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:27.140 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
oh please representative Woods if I if I
 
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
might uh thank you
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
um I I think we're trying to send to me
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh we're trying to send a message that
 
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
this this area
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
medical Technologies in general needs to
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
be addressed in some way
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay that's a very vague statement but I
 
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
think you're absolutely correct that
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
there will be conceivably an absolutely
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
overwhelming I mean overwhelming demand
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
for its those services
 
00:57:01.319 --> 00:57:02.049 align:start position:0%
for its those services
um

00:57:02.049 --> 00:57:02.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
I worked with a group that was trying to
 
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
look at a breast cancer evaluation yeah
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
and the issue of fast MRIS
 
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
um versus you know tomography and
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
regular MRIs fasting or is a technology
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's relatively new
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
and that they said well gee we want the
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
the uh a blessing of this committee
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
and then who who uh who who uh initiates
 
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
that and there's a multitude of niche
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that would come to the
 
00:57:38.579 --> 00:57:40.069 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that would come to the
fore

00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
fore
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
um and how that gets put through some
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
kind of sieve uh it would be is going to
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
be interesting because the potential is
 
00:57:52.849 --> 00:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
is just
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
um I mean it's I mean this is from AI to
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
nanoparticles uh to crispr uh I mean is
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
I mean it is it is unbelievably Broad
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
and I think there is a risk that it
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
could be overwhelmed and the mechanism
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
there has to be some kind of mechanism
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
to have it be focused and whether it's
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
the chair of the oversight committee or
 
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:21.380 align:start position:0%
someone in HHS
 
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure and just it's just a
 
00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:28.030 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure and just it's just a
comment

00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:29.780 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
calling up the collective wisdom in this
 
00:58:32.819 --> 00:58:33.890 align:start position:0%
calling up the collective wisdom in this
room

00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
that would include our uh test uh our
 
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.829 align:start position:0%
that would include our uh test uh our
testifiers

00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
testifiers
 
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
is this a repeat
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
of a process that goes on at the federal
 
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:53.540 align:start position:0%
level at FDA at perhaps CDC
 
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
at uh
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh CMS is it are we
 
00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:03.380 align:start position:0%
doing what they are already doing
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
or are we making decisions de novo you
 
00:59:11.329 --> 00:59:11.339 align:start position:0%
know new decisions that apply only
 
00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
within our state
 
00:59:14.359 --> 00:59:15.890 align:start position:0%
within our state
so

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:17.569 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:59:17.569 --> 00:59:17.579 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
if Miss Clifford
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
bound or oriented by CMS for example
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
um is it necessary for us to do that
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
work over again
 
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
or do we simply say well it's already
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
getting done we don't have to do it
 
00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:42.299 align:start position:0%
uh my tank here is the role that
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
committee would be to evaluate exactly
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
how they reached that decision
 
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
um there are the U.S task force
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
um which we're all familiar with uh uh
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
and is is sometimes quoted rather
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
extensively is as a you know really a
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
gold standard
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
but in the medical community it is not
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
the gold standard and I can cite several
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
examples where they went awry
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and um I won't get into detail but I
 
01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:16.460 align:start position:0%
think the same
 
01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:20.420 align:start position:0%
cautious approach would have to be taken
 
01:00:23.329 --> 01:00:23.339 align:start position:0%
and not just blanketly adopt well the
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
CDC said okay the FDA said okay or the
 
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
STP are forgotten The Liberation U.S
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
task force uh said okay and adopt it
 
01:00:41.569 --> 01:00:41.579 align:start position:0%
um my sense is would be to take a firmer
 
01:00:41.579 --> 01:00:42.289 align:start position:0%
um my sense is would be to take a firmer
look

01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
to see how they arrived at that
 
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the decisions made by the FDA
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
in the past two and a half years
 
01:01:04.559 --> 01:01:07.670 align:start position:0%
in the past two and a half years
representative

01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
and looking at decisions that I know
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
have come out of CDC
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh having been in contact with Rochelle
 
01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.809 align:start position:0%
uh having been in contact with Rochelle
wolinski

01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
wolinski
 
01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.579 align:start position:0%
um who I know from a different venue
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
entirely about what she found when she
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
took over the CDC
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
the decisions that we get at the federal
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
level uh representative Edward she will
 
01:01:38.589 --> 01:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
be surprised to hear this
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
those decisions are often as much
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:48.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:01:48.849 --> 01:01:48.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
often economic and financial rather than
 
01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.970 align:start position:0%
often economic and financial rather than
scientific

01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:54.980 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.809 align:start position:0%
scientific
and

01:01:56.809 --> 01:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:56.819 --> 01:01:58.190 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
as a small state I don't know that we
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
have the resources
 
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
to review their reasoning in detail but
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
I must say that I have
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
not uncommonly found their reasoning
 
01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.470 align:start position:0%
not uncommonly found their reasoning
suspect

01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.549 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
I would offer an example of the 5G
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
commission that looked at the radiation
 
01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:24.020 align:start position:0%
and the role of the scfcc
 
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
in establishing medical criteria and
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
that was found to be deficient and
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
actually they're in the process of being
 
01:02:34.809 --> 01:02:34.819 align:start position:0%
sued because they uh
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
performed uh of course a policy
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
determination without actually
 
01:02:43.089 --> 01:02:43.099 align:start position:0%
performing the work
 
01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:45.740 align:start position:0%
and it's that kind of
 
01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.530 align:start position:0%
and it's that kind of
review

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:47.540 align:start position:0%
review
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
the commission did look at and was able
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
to say that a further comments are
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
needed in this area and I think this the
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
committee we're referring to would would
 
01:03:04.569 --> 01:03:04.579 align:start position:0%
hopefully be able to find that same
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
same source and of in of information
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
having several experts here
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
I would have to ask whether a an
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
emerging medical Technologies task force
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire might likewise be
 
01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.819 --> 01:03:31.089 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

01:03:31.089 --> 01:03:31.099 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
the people on that would have sufficient
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
standing and sufficient fortitude to be
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
able to go to sometimes even the
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
original sources and I I I refer to that
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
again back to the 5G commission or on
 
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
that commission we looked at some of the
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
scientific detail and were able to
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
contact people who actually did the work
 
01:04:02.809 --> 01:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
and found that they were being misquoted
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
in some instances and I would think that
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
the commission would do would do the do
 
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.930 align:start position:0%
the same
foreign

01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
okay so I I think in general in the last
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
couple decades we've been seeing the
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
erosion of rigor in a lot of the
 
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
scientific communities and the increased
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
politicization of of that's replacing it
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
and so anything we do is subject to the
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
same sort of environmental threat but
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean we shouldn't do
 
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
something and so so so I would like to
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
maybe come at this for a moment just to
 
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
explore an alternative path
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
um I know under DHHS
 
01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:54.299 align:start position:0%
we have contracts with UNH to where they
 
01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:57.140 align:start position:0%
loan us professors for specific things
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying professors are immune
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
from politics by any means uh professor
 
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
from politics by any means uh professor
saloy

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
but I just wonder if uh if we're we're
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
trying to craft essentially an academic
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
task to take a look at emerging Trends
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
and and Technologies and to be an early
 
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
identifier of significance that that
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
that if there that sounds like an
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
academic Pursuit more than the
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
legislative Pursuit and so I'm wondering
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
if this is something that we should
 
01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
consider as a potential add-on or tweak
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
of a DHHS mission
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm not recommending it I'm just
 
01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
saying is that a viable alternative what
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
are the advantages and disadvantages how
 
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
does it stack against the other
 
01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:54.950 align:start position:0%
does it stack against the other
alternatives

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.809 --> 01:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
I don't have any real strong preference
 
01:06:00.049 --> 01:06:00.059 align:start position:0%
I think regardless of how it's uh uh
 
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
ultimately situated it's going to depend
 
01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
on the individuals within whatever
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
committee that is to be able to to
 
01:06:07.799 --> 01:06:08.990 align:start position:0%
committee that is to be able to to
really

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
hold forth uh academically I mean
 
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
academic in the non-political sense for
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
them to hold forth and any committee
 
01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:20.819 align:start position:0%
regards of where it's situated could in
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
fact uh fall awry
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh and I think it would depend on the
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
people picked and and their individual
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
fortitude and their Collective fortitude
 
01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
uh again regardless of their where
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
they're situated it's going to require
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
that and this is that kind of effort
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
that's going to require uh really uh um
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
a strong individual and a strong
 
01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
Collective effort
 
01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:48.010 align:start position:0%
Collective effort
s

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:48.020 align:start position:0%
s
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
so I just wonder if if we're talking
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
about a legislative committee are we
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
asking a fish to fly in other words you
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
know we are inherently a political body
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
and we're asking for somebody to be
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
devoid of politics and be a an honest
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
broker of an Arbiter of of Truth and
 
01:07:11.809 --> 01:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
visions and I just wonder if
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
maybe the initial premise is flawed of
 
01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
I would completely agree if it's just
 
01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
a legislative body
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
um my surmise and and in the graph that
 
01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:33.660 align:start position:0%
we see here it doesn't identify that
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
this is a legislative
 
01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
subcommittee it just says that the chair
 
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
shall identify who that constitutes that
 
01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh and that gives a
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of attitude I would
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
certainly think there would be a you
 
01:07:51.049 --> 01:07:51.059 align:start position:0%
know some legislative to give some
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
guidance when could we want to translate
 
01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
this into policy at some point
 
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
but my essentially the way this is
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
drafted is would be that the chair uh
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
and again whether in the final form
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
there would be some direction that the
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
chair must have this
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
kind of constituency but my sense would
 
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
be that the intent a paragraph that
 
01:08:16.249 --> 01:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
you've identified would be that this is
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
indeed a a scientific review and
 
01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:22.100 align:start position:0%
requires the
 
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
expertise to accomplish that and clearly
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
the vast majority and I don't mean to be
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
exclusive of anyone but the vast
 
01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
majority of legislators don't
 
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
have a a a a scientific founding to
 
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
allow them to sit on such a committee
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
and therefore I think the predominance
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
of individuals populating that committee
 
01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
would in fact be none legislators and uh
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
but again it depends on the individuals
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
but again I would allow the uh an
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
initial paragraph to identify the intent
 
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
of what this is for uh and make it clear
 
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
what we want to accomplish and the fact
 
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
that it does require a lot of scientific
 
01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.309 align:start position:0%
that it does require a lot of scientific
input

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
input
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
um I one of the things I in trying to
 
01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:15.500 align:start position:0%
investigate to learn more about
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
Precision medicine medicine especially
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
being a carpenter and a truck driver and
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
stuff that
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
um I did notice online that there are
 
01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:26.890 align:start position:0%
um I did notice online that there are
numerous

01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:26.900 align:start position:0%
numerous
 
01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
organizations that are holding
 
01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
conferences entire conferences to
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
understand more about
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
Precision medicine from many different
 
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
perspectives and uh and and so I I think
 
01:09:45.169 --> 01:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
that having an ongoing task force sort
 
01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:48.299 align:start position:0%
of monitor some of those discussions and
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
some of the outcomes is probably one of
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
the best things that we can do at this
 
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
time because there don't seem to be any
 
01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.770 align:start position:0%
time because there don't seem to be any
concrete

01:09:56.770 --> 01:09:56.780 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.189 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and elderly
 
01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.350 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and elderly
affairs

01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
01:10:16.209 --> 01:10:16.219 align:start position:0%
overall and oversight is that we wind up
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
using the 30 000 foot perspective
 
01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
uh to get an idea of where we are where
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
we're going I think we're doing that
 
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
here today and that's extremely useful
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
and we have substantial consensus here
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
that we are a community in the
 
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
legislature Senate and House of Citizen
 
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
legislators okay
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
who do not necessarily have specific
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
expertise in any area
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
but what we have is the opportunity to
 
01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
appoint members of task forces as
 
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
Citizens and and to solicit expert
 
01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.050 align:start position:0%
Citizens and and to solicit expert
testimony

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
to educate legislators and to help in
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
the formulation of policy so I think if
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
we redraft this
 
01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
expert experts who are citizen members
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
of a task force not necessarily a
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
majority but a few and to insist on
 
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
solicited testimony
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
from people in the professional
 
01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
communities I think if we redraft it
 
01:11:48.010 --> 01:11:48.020 align:start position:0%
that way we can use those two tools
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
appointments to the to the committee of
 
01:11:55.090 --> 01:11:55.100 align:start position:0%
the task force and solicited testimony
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
to create a fund of knowledge that would
 
01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:00.620 align:start position:0%
be useful
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
just a reminder that we discussed
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
earlier the likely possibility that this
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
task force could well be overwhelmed
 
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:14.219 align:start position:0%
with the need to review a number of
 
01:12:14.219 --> 01:12:17.090 align:start position:0%
with the need to review a number of
Technologies

01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
Technologies
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
for which
 
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
there really isn't a lot of data
 
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
and I think that's that's going to
 
01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.149 align:start position:0%
and I think that's that's going to
happen

01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:12:26.159 --> 01:12:29.330 align:start position:0%
happen
okay

01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
um further comments I got another story
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm still learning about the um
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
and as uh
 
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
representative Woods pointed out the
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities are extremely diverse on
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
what's what areas of science and
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
technology that this could overlap with
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
or intersect with and and so I'm just
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
curious does do we think that the um the
 
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug affordability
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
board already has a charter or could
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
have a charter amended so that they
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
looked at an emerging biomarker issues I
 
01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
mean that's that's one of the big parts
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
and and it's just an open question I
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
have no opinion
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
oh please um I would view the committee
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
or some community that we're discussing
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
would not be involved at the same level
 
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
that that board uh the affordability
 
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:37.370 align:start position:0%
that that board uh the affordability
board

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
my sense would be this would be looking
 
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
at doesn't have does any particular item
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
have scientific Merit
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
once that has been yay or nayed then the
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
affordability becomes another issue you
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
know are there Grant programs for
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
supporting it do pbms have too high a
 
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
level of criteria
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
that these are the kinds of things once
 
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
clarified that it does meet scientific
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
scientific criteria now I I I would view
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
these as really separate once the
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
scientific aspect has been determined
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
then the business aspect of it would
 
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
come into play that's where I view the
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
affordability board
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
that was an interesting suggestion
 
01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
and until representative wood spoke I
 
01:14:38.450 --> 01:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
thought wow you know we could merge the
 
01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
drug affordability uh for into this but
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
I think he's correct I think yes could
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
we get Mr Williams a comment on the
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
other idea that maybe the DHHS
 
01:14:51.649 --> 01:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
commission like between then but since
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
we have these academic relationships
 
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
anyways whether there's a potential
 
01:14:58.729 --> 01:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
so when when you say
 
01:15:02.689 --> 01:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
that representative Williams you're
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
going to be on the hot seat in just a
 
01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.530 align:start position:0%
going to be on the hot seat in just a
second

01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:05.540 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
whether so would you put this within
 
01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.770 align:start position:0%
whether so would you put this within
DHHS

01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:11.780 align:start position:0%
DHHS
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
within the committee on Health and Human
 
01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
Services elderly Affairs are within the
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
task force are you suggesting that It Go
 
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
within DHHS okay so so this is an
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
exploration of brainstorming effort at
 
01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
alternative ways of getting to the
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
objective an alternative way to get to
 
01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:36.260 align:start position:0%
the objective may be uh to task DHHS
 
01:15:40.729 --> 01:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
with uh providing us with the brush
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
breaking that's necessary to to scan the
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
environment of emerging Science and
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
Technology to help identify those areas
 
01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
that should be of long-term interest to
 
01:15:56.209 --> 01:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
the uh the legislature and and I don't
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
view that as being substantially
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
different than some of the things we ask
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
DHHS to do on our behalf anyways when
 
01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
they start to see Trends in federal
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
legislation or or in other areas they
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
they initiate a relationship with
 
01:16:15.530 --> 01:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
somebody in the legislature a powerful
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
Senator uh you know a compliant
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
representative but they they could they
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
reach out and say hey here's this is
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
coming on can can we talk about it there
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
may be a legislative approach or the
 
01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
that's necessary here and so so I'm just
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
wondering if we should just formalize
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
maybe a DHHS responsibility rather than
 
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
worrying about creating a whole task
 
01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:42.950 align:start position:0%
worrying about creating a whole task
force

01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
force
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
can if I can piggyback an inquiry onto
 
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
yours and address it to
 
01:16:54.729 --> 01:16:54.739 align:start position:0%
councilor Williams yes sir um
 
01:16:59.330 --> 01:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
do you have within DHHS a silo if you
 
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
will a department and office that would
 
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
be responsible for the assessment of
 
01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
medical Technologies Effectiveness and
 
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
or cost
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
who would you ask to do that
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
and represents always chair I just
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to before uh responding to the
 
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
questions posed by representative
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
Edwards and yourself uh that the
 
01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
underlying bill that was the um basis
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
for this committee being created to
 
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
starting things off was actually house
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
built 1290 9-0 so I missed it by one
 
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
digit or ten digits based upon how you
 
01:17:48.649 --> 01:17:48.659 align:start position:0%
view that
 
01:17:48.659 --> 01:17:50.450 align:start position:0%
view that
um so

01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
um a benefit I think to this group and I
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
think continuity of membership attending
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
is always important because I I was
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
thinking to myself sitting in the
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
gallery I wish that represent Merchant
 
01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
was part of this conversation because he
 
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
was here last week and he would see how
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
the evolving conversations are happening
 
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
how best to identify and address it I
 
01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
think there have been very thoughtful
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
additions to the discussions uh as we're
 
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
looking at your your proposal I do think
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
that representative Edwards when he
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
identified that this is an academic
 
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
Pursuit when you're answering at least
 
01:18:24.649 --> 01:18:24.659 align:start position:0%
one of the threshold questions which is
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh and then getting to rep some woods
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
from the last meeting where he talked
 
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
about the Journey of I believe your was
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
his great grandfather who rode horseback
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
in Texas prior to the date uh date it
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
could have been a great rate but I'm
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
pretty sure a great grandfather
 
01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
um great great
 
01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
um and so um how the world of medicine
 
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
has evolved since the days of riding uh
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
the ranges
 
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
um to creation of hospitals and up to
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
now Precision medicine one of the
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
questions that was asked at the last
 
01:18:58.270 --> 01:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
meeting was whether and a particular
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
measure of precision medicine was
 
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
effective or not was a threshold
 
01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
question and that was flushed out a bit
 
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
in the in the conversations that you had
 
01:19:08.689 --> 01:19:08.699 align:start position:0%
at the last meeting with that said that
 
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
gets to the practice of medicine which
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
gets exactly to what representative
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
Edwards was mentioning about this being
 
01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
an academic Pursuit or perhaps one for
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
the world of medicine or the field of
 
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
medicine to assist in identifying as
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
these are are being you know evolving in
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
the process I do think that
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon also identified
 
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
that there's these groups that are out
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
there that are looking at this issue
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
very meaningfully in trying to getting
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
the answers to these questions so that
 
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
you don't have to exhaust resources on
 
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
your own to try to determine what others
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
are already well ahead of us in the
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
conversation for determining what works
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
and doesn't work as it relates to the
 
01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:48.659 align:start position:0%
department I one of the things that we
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to make very clear that we are
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
definitely here we're definitely present
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
we want to participate in the process
 
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
but the world of Medicaid just as it is
 
01:19:59.410 --> 01:19:59.420 align:start position:0%
with the world of affordable
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals drugs that we're a small
 
01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
part a very important part but a small
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
part of a larger Mosaic that deals with
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
also private ARS commercial insurance as
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
well as Medicare and so the pursuit
 
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's being asked to the department
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
specifically here I'd have to address
 
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:17.219 align:start position:0%
that we do not have in-house expertise
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
and I'll repeat that we do not have the
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
in-house expertise to address the
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
threshold question about what types of
 
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
Precision Precision medicines work and
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
which ones do not that would have to be
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
an engagement of the experts in the
 
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
field whether you do it as represent
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
Canon was suggesting through looking out
 
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
those entities out there that are
 
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
currently working at this at a national
 
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
level and or looking at it from how
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is suggesting
 
01:20:47.689 --> 01:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
because there are some practical models
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
with the resources provided however for
 
01:20:53.689 --> 01:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
the Department to engage in new areas
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
that we haven't done before but we would
 
01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
have to have the leveraging of either
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
financial resources and or the ability
 
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
to contract with the resources through
 
01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
the academic world UNH and whatnot to
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
try to do that so I think that's a
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
question for you as a group to identify
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
where do you see this going in terms of
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
addressing that initial threshold
 
01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
question what Precision medicine
 
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
actually has value which works and which
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
ones do not work and whether you want to
 
01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:24.659 align:start position:0%
review a little more deeply what it
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
would look like at a state level for the
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
Department to be given resources to
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
contract with Academia to start looking
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
at this issue or do you want to look at
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
what represent Cannon was saying looking
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
at a national level is the resources out
 
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
there ncsl for example would be a good
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
resource to have those conversations
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
with or maybe you're looking at a blend
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
of both of those Pursuits being being
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
done but I understood also that in
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
addition to that threshold question
 
01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
about which Precision medicines work are
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
do not work the other component here
 
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
that is very helpful and does have a
 
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
political lens to it which is they pay
 
01:22:02.209 --> 01:22:02.219 align:start position:0%
our perspective because the fact that
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
something works the question then
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
becomes from an economic standpoint is
 
01:22:08.209 --> 01:22:08.219 align:start position:0%
there a value to that and there's great
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
conversations at your last meeting
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
relative to balancing out the the worth
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
of what we we do and I'll just refer to
 
01:22:16.729 --> 01:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
your draft minutes which you can take
 
01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
action on at your next meeting uh to get
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
into some of those areas but I think
 
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
that's a real critical part and one of
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
the reasons it was mentioned by reps and
 
01:22:28.130 --> 01:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
Merchant I believe
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
to having this is a permanent
 
01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
subcommittee under HHS oversight in
 
01:22:33.530 --> 01:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
other words not directly the
 
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the parent committee
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
but having its own entity out there was
 
01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
because you're not going to address all
 
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
these issues within the course of a
 
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
biennium as you know HHS oversight has
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
the authority creating subcommittees
 
01:22:48.169 --> 01:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
task force whatever you'd like to do
 
01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
including at least a legislative member
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
as your chair but you can have other
 
01:22:55.490 --> 01:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
members of the public also serving on
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
those as well the downside to it is just
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
like the HHS parent committee every
 
01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
biennium they Sunset and has to be
 
01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
reconstituted every next biennium so
 
01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
knowing that the issues over what
 
01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
medicines work or don't work from
 
01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
Precision medicine is a longitudinal a
 
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:14.699 align:start position:0%
long conversation much longer than
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to have in a biennium
 
01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
and then the other real significant
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
issue which we'll need the assistance of
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature and making findings or
 
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
recommendations is how do you pay for
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
these and and what are the ones that are
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
are should be paid for and I think you
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
it ties back into the medical advocacy
 
01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:34.219 align:start position:0%
of your foundational questions but until
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
you uh you address both those issues
 
01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
meaningfully you you won't even get to
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
the point of access to the public
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
meaningfully around it now are there
 
01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
efforts being made you heard from rather
 
01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
from our Medicaid pharmacist uh Peg
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
Clifford uh that we certainly already
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
through Medicaid provide certain
 
01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
services around Precision medicine and
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh through our agency but the goal here
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
I understood was to build on represent
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
Rogers or Roger's vision of a more
 
01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
robust use of precision medicine within
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
our state so I know there's a lot that I
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
put out there and I hope that in some
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
ways it didn't cause more confusion
 
01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
because I think that the conversations
 
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
are very thoughtful in terms of
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
identifying which functions should fall
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
under one area in which function should
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
follow under another whether it's
 
01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:27.020 align:start position:0%
Academia or a committee that's launched
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
leveraging the resources for those
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
academics to report back information but
 
01:24:34.729 --> 01:24:34.739 align:start position:0%
ultimately there will have to be some
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
type of legislative findings and
 
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
recommendations as to access and how to
 
01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
pay for these
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
um so I will stop that was a lot and
 
01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
there's some oxygen still left in groups
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
well it's a trigger question
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh okay are we aware of any state in our
 
01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
region that's already done something
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
similar or is moving towards doing
 
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
something similar
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of monitoring the future
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
and it could be no that we just don't
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
know what the other states are doing I
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
represent you I don't have that
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
information so I don't know what other
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
states have been doing okay so a
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
straight thought on that is you know if
 
01:25:22.189 --> 01:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
there's another state in our region and
 
01:25:26.169 --> 01:25:26.179 align:start position:0%
maybe we just do a collaboration
 
01:25:28.729 --> 01:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
and then another one and maybe this is
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
more for for for you Professor salloway
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
um if we were to if we were to take a
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
walk through the halls of Academia
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and UNH would we find
 
01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
um an academic who this is already an
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
area of interest for him or her and and
 
01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:49.980 align:start position:0%
what we're really just trying to do is
 
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
to find that person who's already making
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
um if you'll permit me a moment of
 
01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.510 align:start position:0%
um if you'll permit me a moment of
discussion

01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
um a very long time ago
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
when I was young and I am very old at
 
01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:14.370 align:start position:0%
this point excuse me
 
01:26:14.370 --> 01:26:17.830 align:start position:0%
this point excuse me
[Laughter]

01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:26:21.169 --> 01:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
I hit two areas of expertise in my
 
01:26:21.179 --> 01:26:22.490 align:start position:0%
I hit two areas of expertise in my
research

01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
one of them was Alzheimer's
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
and the other was organ donation and
 
01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:30.290 align:start position:0%
and the other was organ donation and
transplantation

01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
transplantation
 
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
and that included by the way because in
 
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:36.780 align:start position:0%
1965 when I was beginning this sort of
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
thing we passed the end-stage renal
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
disease Act
 
01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:43.139 align:start position:0%
which basically said the federal
 
01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
government will pay for dialysis as well
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
when we began taking a look at organ
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
donation and transplantation and
 
01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.450 align:start position:0%
donation and transplantation and
dialysis

01:26:55.450 --> 01:26:55.460 align:start position:0%
dialysis
 
01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
we had a limited number of dialysis
 
01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:00.050 align:start position:0%
we had a limited number of dialysis
couches

01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
couches
 
01:27:02.689 --> 01:27:02.699 align:start position:0%
at Major Medical Centers and we could
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
not service the entire population of
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
people with end-stage renal disease
 
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
we had a very limited supply of donor
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
kidneys we still have a very limited
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
supply of donor kidneys
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
so the question became
 
01:27:23.709 --> 01:27:23.719 align:start position:0%
how do we allocate
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
dialysis Services how do we allocate
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
transplant good precious organs for
 
01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:33.290 align:start position:0%
transplant good precious organs for
transplantation

01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
transplantation
 
01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
and to make those decisions this will
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
become relevant in just a second
 
01:27:40.729 --> 01:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
to make those determinations medical
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
centers that we're doing uh dialysis and
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
Transplant constituted review committees
 
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
to assess each individual case
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
those committees typically included a
 
01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
surgeon because they were going to do
 
01:27:58.090 --> 01:27:58.100 align:start position:0%
the cutting
 
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
in the case of dialysis and nephrologist
 
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
and a Internal Medicine physician social
 
01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:06.830 align:start position:0%
and a Internal Medicine physician social
workers

01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
who would assess the quality of life of
 
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
the individual patients and clergy
 
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
because these were ethical
 
01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:19.330 align:start position:0%
because these were ethical
considerations

01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:19.340 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
a service on those committees by the
 
01:28:25.810 --> 01:28:25.820 align:start position:0%
people who were appointed
 
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
was emotionally exhausting
 
01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
because they were making life and death
 
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
decisions for individuals they were
 
01:28:39.169 --> 01:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
making decisions that affected not just
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
patients but families in some cases
 
01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.270 align:start position:0%
patients but families in some cases
communities

01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:28:47.169 --> 01:28:47.179 align:start position:0%
um what we're talking about constituting
 
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
is a similar Commission on a much larger
 
01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:52.550 align:start position:0%
is a similar Commission on a much larger
scale

01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
scale
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
that will assess
 
01:28:58.370 --> 01:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
is a technology and I've shifted from
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
Precision medicine to Medical Technology
 
01:29:02.530 --> 01:29:02.540 align:start position:0%
urging medical technology
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
is a technology effective and effective
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
for whom and what are the criteria by
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
which we shall decide for whom we will
 
01:29:18.250 --> 01:29:18.260 align:start position:0%
fund a technology for whom we will not
 
01:29:21.649 --> 01:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
this is going to be difficult and
 
01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
exhausting work
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
and while I think that we have done a
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful job of sorting this out and
 
01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm grateful for the suggestions of
 
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
including experts from the University of
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from Dartmouth Medical
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
School practitioners in the community
 
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
I'm you know very grateful for that and
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
we'll craft it into a draft uh
 
01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:49.460 align:start position:0%
resolution for next time
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
I don't know how you're going to
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
convince those people
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
to do this emotionally exhausting work
 
01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be a lot of work uh
 
01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:02.639 align:start position:0%
please representative Woods
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
um I hear about perhaps a slightly
 
01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
different view which may solve part of
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
your problem
 
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
I view the task force that were looked
 
01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
to address is only looking at and to use
 
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
your example of kidney transplants
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
that task force that we're talking about
 
01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
would only be asked to address is it
 
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
scientifically correct to do a kidney
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
transplant is it at that level that we
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
can and the answer would be yes it would
 
01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
not answer the question how are you
 
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
going to fund it how and whom you would
 
01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
make selection for that procedure or the
 
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
all the other dimensions that you
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
described and therefore would not have
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
to address that in in the larger sense
 
01:30:57.370 --> 01:30:57.380 align:start position:0%
but only provide the basis
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
for the decision that in fact there is
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient scientific evidence to move
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
forward and so I I view it my personal
 
01:31:08.689 --> 01:31:08.699 align:start position:0%
view it's a slightly different much more
 
01:31:08.699 --> 01:31:10.330 align:start position:0%
view it's a slightly different much more
constrained

01:31:10.330 --> 01:31:10.340 align:start position:0%
constrained
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to enjoy
 
01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
hoisting you on your own petard
 
01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
so let us say Sir that you are seated on
 
01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
such a task force and that is not an
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
unlikely probability
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
and let us say that you have a gallery
 
01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
filled with people who have a person
 
01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:33.890 align:start position:0%
filled with people who have a person
um

01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
within their family that has breast
 
01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:38.209 align:start position:0%
within their family that has breast
cancer

01:31:38.209 --> 01:31:38.219 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
and they are crying for uh stem cell
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
transplant to treat it or
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
um they have a patient with another form
 
01:31:50.810 --> 01:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
of cancer they believe leotro will work
 
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's going to get better in just a
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
second okay or they are terrified of
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
covet and would like to have a
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
prescription for Ivermectin
 
01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.570 align:start position:0%
prescription for Ivermectin
and

01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
it is now your responsibility
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
to make the decision on your committee
 
01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
to vote Yes we should allow this no we
 
01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
should not allow it
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's the situation that this task
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
force is going to end up in
 
01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.149 align:start position:0%
force is going to end up in
nope

01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
nope
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's correct but it is it's not the
 
01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
secondary decisions that I was I want
 
01:32:31.729 --> 01:32:31.739 align:start position:0%
you to said yes that procedure can go
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
forward okay
 
01:32:36.169 --> 01:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
um and the audience then would have that
 
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
information then next comes the question
 
01:32:42.169 --> 01:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
of funding and and selection which that
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
can be in my understanding or my
 
01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
perception it would not be involved
 
01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
it then goes directly to representative
 
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
so I I need to like step back and say
 
01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about the scope of what
 
01:33:02.689 --> 01:33:02.699 align:start position:0%
this task force is intended to do I I
 
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
mean I'm I'm gonna
 
01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
in 1984 I actually took a class in
 
01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
research and development so I'm going to
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
try to remember that there used to be
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
this this phasing of research and
 
01:33:15.719 --> 01:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
this this phasing of research and
development

01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:33:21.410 --> 01:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
category one two three four and the
 
01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
bigger the number The Closer Closer you
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
got to commercial development of
 
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
something but the the the research that
 
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:32.900 align:start position:0%
was done in one was was thought to be
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
basic research uh not applied in any way
 
01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
so so so what I've imagined this task
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
force to be doing is to be sort of
 
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
standing guard looking at what kinds of
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
issues are coming into uh the the first
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
phase of research
 
01:33:56.930 --> 01:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
and maybe seems viable for the second
 
01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:58.129 align:start position:0%
and maybe seems viable for the second
phase

01:33:58.129 --> 01:33:58.139 align:start position:0%
phase
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
and not still hanging on when it's
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
hitting phase four with commercial
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
applications and so so as you were
 
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
giving a hypothetical about this
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
committee engaging a particular patient
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
scenario I I think this task force would
 
01:34:21.410 --> 01:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
be long long out of the discussion by
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
the time it got to an actual patient
 
01:34:27.649 --> 01:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
seeking actual care I I see this as sort
 
01:34:29.689 --> 01:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
of like in the military you have an
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
intelligence Community who sits and
 
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
tries to identify what the what the what
 
01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
the threat may be and then prioritize
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
the threat in this case we'd be doing
 
01:34:44.209 --> 01:34:44.219 align:start position:0%
the same thing but we'd be doing it for
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
opportunities what are the opportunities
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
what are the potential of the
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities so so we would have an
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
intelligence group that would be looking
 
01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
at these potential opportunities and
 
01:34:59.930 --> 01:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
then alert hurting the legislature that
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
something's coming down the pike for
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
which there may be a policy implication
 
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
I I don't see this committee that we've
 
01:35:09.169 --> 01:35:09.179 align:start position:0%
been theoretically talking about or
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
talking about theoretically
 
01:35:16.090 --> 01:35:16.100 align:start position:0%
as as being Hands-On once
 
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
the technology is mature enough and
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
sufficiently digested by the system to
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
be relevant to any human
 
01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:29.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
no you and I okay
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
because I do do you see the distinction
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make and what you yeah
 
01:35:41.689 --> 01:35:41.699 align:start position:0%
okay yep so you're asking for a scope
 
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
your term yeah
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
which is General
 
01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:48.590 align:start position:0%
which is General
is

01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.149 align:start position:0%
is
um alerts

01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
um alerts
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee to issues that
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
will arise yeah that suggests that the
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
that will make recommendations to
 
01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:00.530 align:start position:0%
that will make recommendations to
oversight

01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
for the specifics but does not itself
 
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
draw up the specifics it says this is an
 
01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:09.179 align:start position:0%
area in which you you'd better be
 
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
looking and you'd better think somebody
 
01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
may want to be drafting an LSR on this
 
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
particular issue much more that than
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
what I thought I heard in terms of
 
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
application of of who should get what
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
yeah if I misspoke I I'm very much in
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
the track of making the scientific
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
decision and the applications then
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
follow and the example I always give is
 
01:36:38.649 --> 01:36:38.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
bardeen uh got uh fourteen thousand
 
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
dollar Grant to look at uh doping in
 
01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.550 align:start position:0%
dollar Grant to look at uh doping in
Silicon

01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
Silicon
 
01:36:49.450 --> 01:36:49.460 align:start position:0%
Adobe is where you put yeah abnormal
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
atoms within silicon germanium
 
01:36:55.129 --> 01:36:55.139 align:start position:0%
specifically and I played with and I
 
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
said why are you giving 14 000 in the
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
solid state physicist to play games with
 
01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
silicon and running
 
01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:03.950 align:start position:0%
silicon and running
um

01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
um germanium atoms around in it uh well
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
out of that came
 
01:37:12.250 --> 01:37:12.260 align:start position:0%
all of computers
 
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
that's the PN Junction or the positive
 
01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
negative Junction uh that became the
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
transistor and the transistors gave
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
their computer so out of fourteen
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars we have
 
01:37:27.169 --> 01:37:27.179 align:start position:0%
all of our computer industry
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
all of it
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
so that's why uh he didn't do any of
 
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
that work he just did the Fourteen
 
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar Grant found out you
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
could control the germanium and silicon
 
01:37:43.490 --> 01:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
and the rest is history and I view this
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
committee the same as we're looking at
 
01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
not germanium and silicon but we're
 
01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
looking at this technology applied to a
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
human being
 
01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
do they mesh and if we say no
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
if we say yes
 
01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion at this point I just
 
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
remember the term I was searching for
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
the level one was just called basic
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
research yep and not not did not the
 
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
commercial research that's done in phase
 
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:14.090 align:start position:0%
commercial research that's done in phase
four

01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:18.229 align:start position:0%
four
uh

01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
in the previous life
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
you went from
 
01:38:25.729 --> 01:38:25.739 align:start position:0%
theoretical determinations to Cellular
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
studies to uh
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
threat models
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to say this to dogs and then
 
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
you know eventually sorry
 
01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:42.290 align:start position:0%
you know eventually sorry
um

01:38:42.290 --> 01:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
a footnote a personal note not to be
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
recorded I once walked into the dog lab
 
01:38:52.610 --> 01:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
I never walked in again
 
01:38:58.610 --> 01:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh and then you know to
 
01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
the first human trials and then
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately to uh the
 
01:39:07.199 --> 01:39:08.770 align:start position:0%
ultimately to uh the
um

01:39:08.770 --> 01:39:08.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
clinical trials you know that okay so I
 
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
need some garden furniture I I don't
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
think I could possibly cover this entire
 
01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
discussion we've had so so in if I were
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
to try to summarize it I would I I would
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
be curious to know if you've heard
 
01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
enough to where you have some ideas of
 
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
how you might want to redraft your draft
 
01:39:36.169 --> 01:39:36.179 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely I've taken notes on the
 
01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:38.699 align:start position:0%
comments that we've had here and I must
 
01:39:38.699 --> 01:39:40.010 align:start position:0%
comments that we've had here and I must
say

01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:40.970 align:start position:0%
say
um

01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:44.110 --> 01:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
I I think that this session has been
 
01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily useful
 
01:39:49.610 --> 01:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
um and this subcommittee generally has
 
01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
performed spectacularly in defining the
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
issue redefining the issue uh pointing
 
01:39:58.669 --> 01:39:58.679 align:start position:0%
at direction in which to move I will
 
01:39:58.679 --> 01:39:59.750 align:start position:0%
at direction in which to move I will
spend

01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
spend
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
um the next 14 days drafting redrafting
 
01:40:02.719 --> 01:40:04.450 align:start position:0%
um the next 14 days drafting redrafting
re-drafting

01:40:04.450 --> 01:40:04.460 align:start position:0%
re-drafting
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
sending it to you quietly just for your
 
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
review keeping in mind that
 
01:40:14.290 --> 01:40:14.300 align:start position:0%
if we share information
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh via email including the entire
 
01:40:20.209 --> 01:40:20.219 align:start position:0%
committee that constitutes public
 
01:40:22.729 --> 01:40:22.739 align:start position:0%
meeting and that is a public document
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
just so you know
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
um but I'll draft it redraft it
 
01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
um speak to many more people
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and get this to you for our next
 
01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.090 align:start position:0%
um and get this to you for our next
meeting

01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
and one is a
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
that is scheduled for October 31st which
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
I will expect that we will have a
 
01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
meeting at that time I would anticipate
 
01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
that it will not be an extended meeting
 
01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
and I will expect that all members of
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's why I scare people when I come
 
01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
out of the elevator so with that we
 
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
can't even have a motion to adjourn
 
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a quorum but um
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
I will
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
um ask for a recess until next time
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh thank you profoundly
 
01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
profoundly thank you uh counselor thank
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
you Ms Clifford
 
01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
um you have contributed so significantly
 
01:41:33.890 --> 01:41:33.900 align:start position:0%
to our thinking today
 
01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
um not genuinely grateful thanks
 
01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
um not genuinely grateful thanks
