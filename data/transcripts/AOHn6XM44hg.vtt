00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.350 align:start position:0%
 
leadership

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:11.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
actually Madam chair if we could do 274
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
first I think it would be easier
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
258 was scheduled for summer oh well
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
that's why I
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
I have coffees
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
or the social media members
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
he did not come out
 
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:43.740 align:start position:0%
the line by line objections that were
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:56.710 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
okay and Madam chair here's a here's one
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
copy of
 
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.050 align:start position:0%
copy of
uh

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
comments and concerns
 
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that's
 
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
Mr Morrill gave me a copy of that I'll
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:51.650 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I move
 
00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:58.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
yeah all right you may speak to your
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
motion well as you can tell by the
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
second is there a second
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh as you can tell by the comments there
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
are a large number of issues with House
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 274
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
and we don't really have time to address
 
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.550 align:start position:0%
and we don't really have time to address
them

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
I think we can do some more work on this
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
over the summer and
 
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
look at the issues that are raised and
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the agencies and see if
 
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
we come up with something
 
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
and but we don't we don't have the time
 
00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
to do it right now
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
I think that some of the concepts from
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
House Bill 274 can be included in house
 
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
bill 358.
 
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
not all of them but some of them and
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
that will help to
 
00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:53.329 align:start position:0%
that will help to
um

00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:53.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
for example I think we I the aid the
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
rulemaking agency excuse me the
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
administrative rules is now sending the
 
00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
rulemaking register for every
 
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
representative which takes care of the
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised on 358 about
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
notifying the subject commit subject
 
00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:16.019 align:start position:0%
experts everybody gets it whether
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
they're a sponsor or just just care
 
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
about the issue they'll have the
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
information and they can act on it and I
 
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
think that solves one of the concerns
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
and I was amazed that I don't remember
 
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
who it was that suggested it but it's so
 
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
easy to do that I'm amazed we didn't do
 
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
it sooner
 
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:46.750 align:start position:0%
it sooner
[Laughter]

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
you seconded would you care to
 
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
and I will say that
 
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.110 align:start position:0%
and I will say that
um

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:05.579 align:start position:0%
my own opinion is that this should
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
actually just be killed it's got so many
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
problems and as the motion made
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
suggested uh these issues could be
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
addressed in 358. so
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
but not all of them and I know the
 
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
sponsors are very concerned about some
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
of the issues that have been raised I
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
think that retaining it
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
having a couple of months of people
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
getting the rulemaking register we can
 
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
see how much interest there is among the
 
00:16:35.699 --> 00:16:37.670 align:start position:0%
see how much interest there is among the
legislature

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
in a very small amount
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
but still we can Implement a few of the
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
ideas right away and see if
 
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
there's any anything else that needs to
 
00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:49.910 align:start position:0%
there's any anything else that needs to
do

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
all right I'm not sure if there's an
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
appetite to implement too many of these
 
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.249 align:start position:0%
appetite to implement too many of these
things

00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
um my what I kind of thought of after
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
the hearing was
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
we heard from so many state agencies
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
with objections and I I'm not sure that
 
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:13.860 align:start position:0%
all the state agencies are even aware of
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
this and I suspect if they're made aware
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
of it and we're studying it over the
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
summer we're going to hear a lot more
 
00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220 align:start position:0%
I think we may be cutting in for a lot
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
of work on it
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
all right well we'll see what happens
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
but I looking at the people who are the
 
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
sponsors I think it would be um
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you madam
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
chair so uh I I am in accord with
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's suggestions uh
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
I think one of the important things that
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
could be done
 
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
um by uh a working group uh working on
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
some of the issues is to clarify the
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
fact that a lot of the concerns that the
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
bill uh seeks to address
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
uh our misunderstandings either of the
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the gel car process
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
especially or uh I don't know the law of
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
gravity for that matter uh because uh
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
there there are just a lot of things in
 
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
the bill that either don't work
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't work or can't work uh so uh to
 
00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:29.419 align:start position:0%
the degree that we get that out there
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
because the people who who are behind
 
00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
this more than just putting their name
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
on something because they think it's
 
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:37.700 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
solve the problems of the administrative
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
rule process
 
00:18:47.049 --> 00:18:47.059 align:start position:0%
are uh it's kind of a pro former
 
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
sponsorship uh in some respects uh but
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
if the people had any experience of gel
 
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.810 align:start position:0%
if the people had any experience of gel
car

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:55.820 align:start position:0%
car
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
then other than representative McGuire
 
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh they they would know that some of
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
this stuff is I say either unworkable
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
and necessary or unconstitutional so and
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
it's important for the legislature to
 
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
understand the gel car process better
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
because it's clear they don't I mean
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
having served on jail card for the past
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
16 plus years I know that we almost
 
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.190 align:start position:0%
16 plus years I know that we almost
never

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
never
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
see a rep
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
at a jail car meeting
 
00:19:26.409 --> 00:19:26.419 align:start position:0%
I mean we as you know I've seen a couple
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh over the years but almost never and
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
most people have no idea what gel car
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
does so the the information and
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
educational aspects of uh of a retain
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
bill could serve that purpose for the
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
for anybody who's willing to subject
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
themselves to some education
 
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
I I will say that I think
 
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
um possibly sending out
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions about the rules May
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
solicit a little more interest from
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
members I think a lot of our members
 
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:04.220 align:start position:0%
don't understand
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
jalcar and therefore just kind of avoid
 
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
the whole issue yes as
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
when we were getting ready to sign this
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
off the speaker the speaker and I were
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
talking about it and he intends to have
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Committees get
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
the rep have a subset a subcommittee on
 
00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:26.529 align:start position:0%
the rep have a subset a subcommittee on
each

00:20:26.529 --> 00:20:26.539 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
legislative policy committee and charge
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
them with looking at rules and so that
 
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
at least some members of the legislature
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
will be more informed other than Edna of
 
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
course were all experts
 
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
and so that way we'll we'll give them a
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
chance to look at the rules
 
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:51.299 align:start position:0%
well I think in addition that the um the
 
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
reality is that most legislators don't
 
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
understand rules
 
00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
they they don't they don't get it what
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
rules do uh we've had people come in and
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
and lecture us on how the agencies are
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
running wild running among their out of
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
control blah blah blah blah and so forth
 
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:12.620 align:start position:0%
as if uh as if there were no
 
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
requirements uh whatsoever so the other
 
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
thing that we might be able to do if we
 
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
retain this is take a look at the places
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
where there is still broad rulemaking
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
Authority which is why the agencies can
 
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
run amok because we've said you guys
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
make the rules we don't want to know
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
well that that's not that that is not
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
unfounded uh and and it such a remark is
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
indicative of the fact that you actually
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
know what you're talking about because
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
you've been on the job car for what 10
 
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:46.940 align:start position:0%
years now anyway
 
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:51.299 align:start position:0%
15 okay who's counting uh
 
00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:52.370 align:start position:0%
15 okay who's counting uh
uh

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
and and the thing is that uh
 
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.890 align:start position:0%
and and the thing is that uh
that

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:56.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
the reality is uh that
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
um most of people uh you remember the
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
bill that you filed early days when you
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
came on Edna uh to uh repeal a whole
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
remember the one repealed like 30
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
sections anybody still here Mike would
 
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
be knowledgeable about that uh
 
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:25.340 align:start position:0%
whole slate it must have been 30 repeal
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
uh sections to the rule and a bunch of
 
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
them dealt with these these barn doors
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
as you came to call them uh and it's
 
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
true and the the first statement in the
 
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:38.940 align:start position:0%
statute would be the commissioner shell
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
right rules to implement the statute
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
well duh that means that he or she can
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
do anything that's necessary but as we
 
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
also learned of a number of the rules
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
writing coordinators that the agencies
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
really don't like that because uh it was
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
a lack of specificity means they're
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
completely out there on the diving board
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh with some questions whether they're
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
in water in the pool uh and when the
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
when the statute says you shall do this
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
and this and this and this and this then
 
00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:12.919 align:start position:0%
they're only carrying out the
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
legislature's instructions totally
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
different set of circumstances and a
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
different outcome as well but to the
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
degree that you repeal one of these barn
 
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.130 align:start position:0%
degree that you repeal one of these barn
doors

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
doors
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
upon which a whole entity has been
 
00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
constructed in many cases I think the
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare rules were one of the examples
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
something which the commissioner wrote
 
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
had broad rule making Authority
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
um and the net effect was that if you
 
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
repealed that Authority the whole entity
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
would collapse because there was no
 
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
Authority for it except that particular
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
thing not a good arrangement and we have
 
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
since and representative McGuire has led
 
00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
the fight and I've supported her because
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
it really is true that it's much more
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
effective if we say exactly what the
 
00:23:59.210 --> 00:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
what the agencies should do and not
 
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
leave them out there to have to invent
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
everything not a good situation and we
 
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:07.100 align:start position:0%
don't we don't write those
 
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
broad rule-making authorities anymore
 
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
because of the exact issue that we're
 
00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:15.890 align:start position:0%
because of the exact issue that we're
discussing

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
um I just want to acknowledge I I see Mr
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
Williams from helping Human Services uh
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
who was here they did not have a
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative at our hearing I believe
 
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they have the same issues as
 
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
the other agencies pretty much although
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
yes I did have a conversation with him
 
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
before we began and he indicated that so
 
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
like I said I just wanted to acknowledge
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
that he appeared to
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
put in a word for for that agency today
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
um so are we ready to vote on this I
 
00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:51.770 align:start position:0%
um so are we ready to vote on this I
think

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I'll just ask for a show of hands
 
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.130 align:start position:0%
um I'll just ask for a show of hands
um

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
is everyone okay with retain
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
those of you may be wondering why my
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
hand did not appear I am not on the
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
I thank you all from the agency
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
this morning we we appreciate your input
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
as to the difficulties with the bill and
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
and your time and as a long-term member
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
of calc one moment Mr commissioner
 
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh um if you may the thing is it's very
 
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
important that we have you people here
 
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
people who actually work with this and
 
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
are governed by it and so forth who know
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
what works and what doesn't and Mr
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
morrill's memo is extremely useful and
 
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
to the point so thank you all of you
 
00:25:49.620 --> 00:26:09.590 align:start position:0%
to the point so thank you all of you
foreign

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
all right so the subcommittee on
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
houseville 274 is closed
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
and I will open the subcommittee on
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.330 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:26.289 --> 00:26:26.299 align:start position:0%
I did um
 
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire did you have an
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:39.539 align:start position:0%
the things that I thought we should
 
00:26:44.289 --> 00:26:44.299 align:start position:0%
change is on page one the the
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
starting on line 23
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
the description set that revised text
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be Rewritten we want we want to
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
and have in fact begun
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
sending the notice with the copy of the
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
rule to every member of the legislature
 
00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:06.059 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:06.710 align:start position:0%
which is
um

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
easier than this to be honest it just
 
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
put a
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's an email list
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
and it's more effective because there
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
are often legislators who are not on the
 
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
policy committee who might be interested
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
in a bill
 
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
yeah it might be subject matter experts
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
or the sponsor or whatever so just send
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
it to everybody
 
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.850 align:start position:0%
it to everybody
and

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
this should allow the legislature to
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
look at the rule and comment during the
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
public comment period
 
00:27:38.769 --> 00:27:38.779 align:start position:0%
and I will say that they take
 
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
comments from legislators whether
 
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
they're the sponsors or on the policy
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
committee or not very seriously I had a
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
chat with
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
uh representative not representative
 
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
with mismo digliani on the
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration rules which I had
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
some constituent issues with
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
and they replied and looked and they
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
made some changes I'm not 100 happy with
 
00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
their changes but until I get another
 
00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:11.210 align:start position:0%
their changes but until I get another
constituent

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
constituent
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
issue I'm going to at which point I'll
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
ask them to take another look at it but
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
they did you know acknowledge the
 
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
comments and
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
um consider them
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
so any legislator can comment
 
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
and this will be
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
no more work for the agencies unless
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
they get a lot of legislators writing
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
NASA emails saying you've got it wrong
 
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
in which case I'll have to start over
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
again but if it's just the usual
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
specific comments
 
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
this is during the public comment period
 
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
anyway they're expecting comments
 
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
so it's it should be efficient enough
 
00:28:51.649 --> 00:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
for the agency to deal with legislative
 
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
comments at that point
 
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
much easier than at any other point and
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
more appropriately than when it comes to
 
00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.450 align:start position:0%
more appropriately than when it comes to
jailcar

00:28:59.450 --> 00:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
jailcar
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that section would be Rewritten to
 
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
just say so
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
I agree that that is that the time for
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
comments is early days not after things
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
have already taken the right turn or
 
00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:15.419 align:start position:0%
left her well I mean obviously the
 
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
agency can go out for comments before
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
they have a draft
 
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.750 align:start position:0%
they have a draft
but

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
probably easier for people who are not
 
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
complete experts to look at them after
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
I would ask Mr Morrill would do you have
 
00:29:38.289 --> 00:29:38.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative Ryan would would you guys
 
00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:45.059 align:start position:0%
turn your mics off because I think we're
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
getting a little overloaded
 
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
yeah all right and then um I sent you
 
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
comments that I
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative O'Brien
 
00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Madam chair may I
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
ask a question uh to uh representative
 
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
McGuire through the chair please uh I
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
hate to bring up 274 we put that one to
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
bed temporarily for now
 
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
um but I'm looking on page four and
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
where it refers to uh notifying some of
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders by U.S mail I see in
 
00:30:21.679 --> 00:30:23.210 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders by U.S mail I see in
358

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
358
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
and it's my hope that this would Trump
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh in the future work as we look at 274
 
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.789 align:start position:0%
uh in the future work as we look at 274
uh

00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
and get away from the U.S Meal which I
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
imagine would be a cost to uh to state
 
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
to send it out to all the stakeholders
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay it's on pay uh House Bill 274 page
 
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.299 --> 00:30:56.529 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:30:56.529 --> 00:30:56.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
with envisioning setting it up by email
 
00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I just add there's already an
 
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
existing email list for the rulemaking
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
register and I believe they just added
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
all house members or possibly all
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
Republicans all Democrats
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
okay so it wouldn't really go out U.S
 
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
mail snail mail
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
okay I wouldn't think that would be
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
timely and would Dad if if I may follow
 
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.610 align:start position:0%
timely and would Dad if if I may follow
up

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh what dad also include some of the
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
stakeholders themselves or is this uh
 
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
entirely meant just for the
 
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
representatives the stakeholders are
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
this is for the rulemaking register
 
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
which comments which lists all the rules
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
that are being
 
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
that are now in draft form and going to
 
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing the
 
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
these stakeholders are determined by
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
each agency and they send out each
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
specific rule for example a licensing
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
board sends a notice to all of the
 
00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:06.610 align:start position:0%
board sends a notice to all of the
licensees

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:06.620 align:start position:0%
licensees
 
00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
I don't know who Des sends licenses
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
sends their notices to but I bet they
 
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
have a mail-in list of people that want
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
to know
 
00:32:15.539 --> 00:32:27.010 align:start position:0%
to know
and

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:27.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:30.779 align:start position:0%
for example hopefully when their schools
 
00:32:32.529 --> 00:32:32.539 align:start position:0%
are coming up for a specific weapons
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
send out drafts even someone's prior to
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
often file to them they'll get them
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
before we move forward if not they'll
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
they get copies now
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
one smile
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.769 align:start position:0%
thank you
[Music]

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:51.779 --> 00:32:57.070 align:start position:0%
[Music]
right

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
Michael Morrell director of the
 
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit in office of
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
legislative Services I do know for a
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
fact that the Department of
 
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services always involves
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders because they want to be up
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
front and it saves problems later on
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
they automatically send things to the US
 
00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:19.460 align:start position:0%
EPA and depending on the type of rule
 
00:33:22.009 --> 00:33:22.019 align:start position:0%
whether it's regulating Wetlands or
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
something they know who the major
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are and they involve them
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
also when agencies send submit notices
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
for the rulemaking register they are
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
also obliged by law to notify any member
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
of the public who has asked them to be
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
notified of rules on a particular
 
00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:47.870 align:start position:0%
notified of rules on a particular
subject

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
combination I think now it's uh email
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
that provision about U.S males been in
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
there a long time and it's not practical
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
to do that that used to be a burden for
 
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
agencies because if say the nursing
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
board had to send out notices to all 30
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
000 nurses then it would be very
 
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.470 align:start position:0%
000 nurses then it would be very
expensive

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
was one of my concerns when I was going
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
through this field because it didn't
 
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
really make it clear how the
 
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
notification was happening and my
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
thought was yeah if you've got to notify
 
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of people via U.S mail several
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
times a year you're talking some pretty
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
large dollar signs so I think we have to
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
be really careful about mandating in
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
statute that stuff be by US mail because
 
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
then you're stuck with it so we ought to
 
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
Tinker with that to make sure that
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
notification is accomplished but but
 
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
it's but it U.S mail in some cases I
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
think U.S mail makes sense because then
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
you have a legal record just like
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
um at the county level notification has
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
to be in the newspaper for example by by
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
Statute and so some of these things we
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
are necessary but the the thing that Mr
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
moral attorney moral just uh is stated
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
is a factor that we have to take into
 
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
consideration so we just have have a
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
little box that we we make sure that we
 
00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:14.099 align:start position:0%
get that straightened out which way
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it and and not
 
00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
burden the statute and the agencies with
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
the U.S mail requirement where it's not
 
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.870 align:start position:0%
the U.S mail requirement where it's not
appropriate

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
well I will be I'll check the language
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
with director moral but my intent is to
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
use email for the rulemaking register
 
00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
perfectly adequate for reaching 99 of
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
the actually more I believe represent
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
Mr moral I believe you've indicated you
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
have another comment yes as the statute
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
is written now it just sets up options
 
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
as far as a type of notification for the
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
agency so they might send things by US
 
00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
mail they might post something on their
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
website I believe House Bill 358 is
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to require all agencies to post a
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
copy of their proposed rule on their
 
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.190 align:start position:0%
copy of their proposed rule on their
website

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
major major agencies do that now but I
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.609 --> 00:36:24.619 align:start position:0%
another section that I would like to
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
include is that
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
when the agency
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
prepares the final rule after the public
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
comment period
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
they should acknowledge and respond to
 
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
the public comments
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed of Environmental
 
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
Services does so very nicely right now
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
other agencies may or may not
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
and I think that having an explicit
 
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.490 align:start position:0%
and I think that having an explicit
record

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:54.500 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
that yes we got these comments and this
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
is what we did with them they may say we
 
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:01.140 align:start position:0%
thought these were irrelevant and we
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
ignored them
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
but at least we'll know that the public
 
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
has commented and the agency has at
 
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
least looked at the comments and I'm not
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
quite sure where in two set in 358 to
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
put that requirement
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I would ask the sponsor
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
um she's a member of the committee
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
um do you
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
do you feel that you can have an
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
amendment ready if subcommittee meets
 
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
again or would you prefer retaining this
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
to have a little life I prefer to have a
 
00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
set I'd prefer to have it have it passed
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
was it because I'd like to
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I will get work on an
 
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.690 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I will get work on an
agency

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:44.700 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
well since it's not an early Bill we
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
have several weeks yeah so
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
um if you will let us know when you're
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
ready and we can schedule another
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
I will add respond to comments because
 
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
that I think that at least is
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
will help a lot because there's nothing
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
worse than writing a comment on a rule
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
and having it vanished Into The Ether at
 
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
least if the agency when they come back
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
with the final rule you'll know that
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
they looked at your comment and said
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
well this person doesn't know what she's
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
or we've con we've considered it and
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it or we considered it
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
a nice idea we've Incorporated and we
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
yeah it sounds reasonable
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
any further comments Mr Morrill
 
00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:46.619 align:start position:0%
I was going to suggest to representative
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
McGuire one further Amendment to the
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
bill our office recently discovered an
 
00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:55.700 align:start position:0%
error in 541a
 
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
we should have found it much earlier in
 
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:02.300 align:start position:0%
2021 RSA 541
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
A14 was changed in two places to require
 
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
that the gel car respond to a final
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
proposal by agencies within 60 days it
 
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
had been 45 days and it was changed to
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
60 days unfortunately there's a
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
provision in 542 and a 13 that was not
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
changed and still says 45 days I think
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:39.370 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:39.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
that that's all the comments
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
from the from the hearing and that other
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
people have brought to my attention uh
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
it does include
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
358 as written does include
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
scheduling fixes from 274 like on page
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
four it says in the case of a board of
 
00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:05.339 align:start position:0%
commission the deadline is 14 days after
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
its regular meeting
 
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
so that we don't want to require the
 
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
boards or commissions to have to
 
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
schedule special meetings to deal with
 
00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:22.370 align:start position:0%
schedule special meetings to deal with
rulemaking

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:26.930 align:start position:0%
 
event

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.930 align:start position:0%
um
I

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.329 --> 00:40:46.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I had a question
 
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:53.780 align:start position:0%
sorry I'll yield thank you
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
so when you go when you once you get the
 
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
amendment and we look at this that's
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
when the committee will look at 274 and
 
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:05.260 align:start position:0%
see what's already covered here
 
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:08.510 align:start position:0%
see what's already covered here
[Music]

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:13.490 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:19.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
what exactly just March 8th and it
 
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
should be ready
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
so my question is I heard conversation
 
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
and this is a process thing forgive me
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
being new
 
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.349 align:start position:0%
being new
um

00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
274 I heard comments that it probably
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
has some things that are covered in 358.
 
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
so my question is by dealing with 358
 
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
and moving it along then when we look at
 
00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.329 align:start position:0%
and moving it along then when we look at
two

00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:51.980 align:start position:0%
the other one
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
274. uh we will be able to study then
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
what's already covered in 358 that could
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
be removed from 274 my understanding
 
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
my dyslexic brain was trying to
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
reconcile all those comments so thank
 
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.030 align:start position:0%
reconcile all those comments so thank
you

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
retained bills are not worked on till
 
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
we're through with all the house bills
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
and all the Senate bills so you're
 
00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:29.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
I try to schedule one meeting in May or
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
early June to scope up what you're going
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
to do on the bill
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
and then we get back together in late
 
00:43:01.569 --> 00:43:01.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairs it's just uh
 
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
scheduling issue uh sounds like we have
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
mutual agreement on the McGuire
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
amendment that will be forthcoming I
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
just want to can that be scheduled I
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
think the uh the committee chair did say
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
March 8th is that something we can do
 
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
right before the executive session you
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
know have a brief uh
 
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting and then get right
