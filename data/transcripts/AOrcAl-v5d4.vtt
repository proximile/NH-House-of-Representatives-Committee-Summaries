00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
I thought would be appropriate was to
 
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
give this subject matter to them because
 
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
these uh members of this commission Are
 
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
all uh either retired or working Law
 
00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers they deal with
 
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
these body warn cameras they're the ones
 
00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 align:start position:0%
that are actually wearing in them
 
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
processing them and they're able to talk
 
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
with their uh Brethren from around the
 
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
country to find out and discuss what are
 
00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
good practices what are the best
 
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
practices so uh that's exactly what this
 
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation does it directs
 
00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 align:start position:0%
them to uh come up with a report um
 
00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully um they will do that and then
 
00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
we could meet uh bring together the
 
00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
parties and have uh some legislation
 
00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 align:start position:0%
hopefully in the fall so uh at that
 
00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
point I will conclude my testimony and
 
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman did we
 
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
um Did we tell our colleagues at the at
 
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
the commission we would be doing this to
 
00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 align:start position:0%
them um I did in fact I talked with
 
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
director skippa because he had asked me
 
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
about a fiscal note so you will see that
 
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal note here it does
 
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
spend some money because they're going
 
00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
to be issuing a report but they know
 
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for Senator
 
00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
M just to clarify the the leak
 
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
commission uh that we're talking about
 
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
is a a different leak commission than
 
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
the one that was established by Governor
 
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
sonunu a few years ago yes it is and
 
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
this and the leak commission that we're
 
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
that we're actually talking about uh is
 
00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement accreditation
 
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
commission and that that that's why it's
 
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
all law enforcement officers or former
 
00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers
 
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
follow their their goal is to create a
 
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
standard Statewide for um state law
 
00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies to achieve in order
 
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
to um get accredited by the state agency
 
00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
so they're setting best practices across
 
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
the state yeah follow up yeah
 
00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
um part of part of the issue with with
 
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
body cams is there there has been push
 
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
back and we heard some of this on a
 
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
similar bill I think it was HB uh 1021
 
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
um that there are times when uh police
 
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
officers may not have their cameras
 
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
turned on they may cut the audio at
 
00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 align:start position:0%
certain points and one of the things
 
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
that came up is you know should we be
 
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
more directive about things like when
 
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
audio is cut and when audio isn't cut um
 
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
one thing that just strikes me as as a
 
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
concern uh is that we get those concerns
 
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
you know from citizens and people who've
 
00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
had encounters with law enforcement and
 
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
if we have a group made up exclusively
 
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
of Law Enforcement Officers that's
 
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
looking to kind of take our legislation
 
00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 align:start position:0%
around body camps to the next level I'm
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
just wondering if we're getting the kind
 
00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 align:start position:0%
all of the input uh that we really need
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
to get on the issue um thank you very
 
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
much for the comment um the chair is ex
 
00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
correct I mean these are made up of
 
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
people that are either retired or
 
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
they're working in law enforcement um
 
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
one of the things we discovered um and
 
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
on a commission that I was working on a
 
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
few years ago that there wasn't
 
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
standardization across the board for
 
00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 align:start position:0%
every Department everyone would do
 
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
something a little differently and so we
 
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
charged this board to come up with
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
standards that's why the chair of
 
00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and the chair of Criminal
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
Justice is on this particular committee
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
um they're the ones that are out there
 
00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
working every day with these cameras
 
00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that you know know what
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
the standards quite frankly should be
 
00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
and so we're looking to get advice from
 
00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
them we also will have the County
 
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
attorneys um involved but we want to get
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
the report first and get a reaction and
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
see what they have to say um and we'll
 
00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 align:start position:0%
bring everybody together and we'll file
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
legislation this is not going to be done
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
in a vacuum um this is a very public
 
00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
process I'm sure people are going to be
 
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
watching the these meetings that we go
 
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
to are open to the public so if citizens
 
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
are concerned about what they're
 
00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 align:start position:0%
discussing they're more than welcome
 
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
they even have a public comment uh time
 
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
for the public to come in and talk so um
 
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
I don't see it as a problem there's
 
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
plenty of opportunity for people to be
 
00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
involved but this is to get their
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
perspective on their be best practices
 
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
because we're going to take that and it
 
00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
will be something that will go into this
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
new manual that's been created about
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
best practices and creating standards
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
across the state so it shouldn't matter
 
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
if you got stopped in conquered you got
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
stopped in Salem or you got stopped in
 
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 align:start position:0%
Berlin the standard will be the
 
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
same you're welcome and and and most
 
00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
importantly this would result in
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
legislation where there'd be a public
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
hearing and we'd get the same feedback
 
00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
we heard already and everyone would have
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to weigh in
 
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative s
 
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question Senator um I'm just
 
00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
curious because not every Police
 
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
Department in the state requires body
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
worn cameras and so I'm I'm curious
 
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
whether I know that's not specifically
 
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
identified in your um in your bill but I
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
just wasn't sure if there was an impact
 
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
associated with where you're talking
 
00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 align:start position:0%
about trying to make sure that it's fair
 
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
treatment you know Equitable treatment
 
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide how the impact of some towns
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
having and some not how that relates
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question question
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
the towns that don't have them this
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
isn't going to impact them at all where
 
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
it will impact them is if they decide
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
they want to have body worn cameras and
 
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
now these are the standards that they
 
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
must adhere to um I I think hopefully
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
that answers your question I mean I'm I
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
am not going to micromanage um in this
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
legislation and say every police officer
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
in the state has to wear them that is a
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
local decision that they're going to
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
make um it as you can imagine it's
 
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.749 align:start position:0%
make um it as you can imagine it's
extremely

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
expensive and um if we mandated it we'd
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
have to pay for it under article 21A so
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
I don't see that happening all the only
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
thing I see happening is if a if a
 
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
department that does not use these
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
cameras decide they want to these are
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
the standards they have to adhere to
 
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.469 align:start position:0%
the standards they have to adhere to
you're

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
welcome represent
 
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
Newman thank could could you comment on
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
as you were doing your preparation for
 
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
this and and came to the idea that it
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
should be what you have in the bill
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
right now what kind of feedback you got
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
if any about the current law and how was
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
that helpful to come up with that I'm
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
just curious how it's working the one
 
00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:19.879 align:start position:0%
that's in effect now thank you very much
 
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
um I think the one that we have now it's
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
kind of like a skeletal frame that
 
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 align:start position:0%
really needs to be fleshed out and this
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
is what this bill attempted to do and
 
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879 align:start position:0%
there there were groups of people that
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
came in that said it went too far and
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
there were groups of people that came in
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
and said it was didn't go far enough and
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
so that's why I thought you know let's
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
talk to the people who really do this
 
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
every day the members of the commission
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
are from all over the state so we're
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
just not going to get the big cities
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to get the small towns as
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
well so I um they're serious about doing
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
this work and so I would like to
 
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
publicly thank them for willing to do
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
this but um I just think it needs to be
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
fleshed out more um and we'll see what
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
they come up
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
with thank you that's
 
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:17.879 align:start position:0%
helpful and every so often Federal grant
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
money appears and if a department
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a standard to adhere to it
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult for them to be able
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
to apply for it and and get it and put
 
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
it into use so having a having this made
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
standardized um after we get the
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
feedback and put it into legislation
 
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
will help departments who can't
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily afford it based on their tax
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
money but could if they had grant money
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
to do so um any further questions seeing
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your testimony thank
 
00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:47.959 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman anybody
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
Andrew good morning my name is Steven
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
andw I'm an assistant County attorney in
 
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
maram County with me is Paul Halverson
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
who is the maram County Attorney both of
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
us have been prosecutors for over 20
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
years um body warn cameras are actually
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
a really fascinating subject and uh New
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a body warn camera statute
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 105 D2 and when you look at that
 
00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
statute you can break it down
 
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
essentially into two major parts the
 
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
first part is the creation of the body
 
00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:37.079 align:start position:0%
warant camera recording by law
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
enforcemen out in the field and then the
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
second part of that statute deals with
 
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
handling of body warn recordings once
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're already
 
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
made that that second part of the
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
statute where it talks about handling a
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
body warn camera recordings has sort of
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
four subsections as I read it talks
 
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
about a Prohibition on copying altering
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
or Distributing the body warn camera
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
talks about guidelines for accessing
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
body warn cameras it talks about
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines for storage of body warn
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
cameras and then there's requirements
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
related to the destruction or retention
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
of body warn camera
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
recordings the the difficulty with the
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
way the current statute is written is it
 
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't really take into account any way
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
for those camera recordings to be used
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
during the discovery process in in
 
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.910 align:start position:0%
during the discovery process in in
criminal

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
prosecution um if you read the statute
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
literally it says no person shall copy
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
Cy body warn camera
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
recordings normally um discover is
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
fairly liberal in New Hampshire where if
 
00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
we have something as the prosecution we
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
provide it to the defense makes it
 
00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
difficult if the police department has a
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
body warant camera recording are they
 
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
allowed to copy it and give it to the
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
prosecution and are we subsequently
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to then copy it and give it to
 
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.949 align:start position:0%
allowed to then copy it and give it to
the

00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
defense and if we do in fact copy it and
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
give it to the defense it brings up
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
questions about Act access storage and
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
retention of those body warn camera
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
recordings that again are all addressed
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
in 105 D2 but once you start making a
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
copy and giving it to a third party it
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's out of our hands with with what
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
happens with it it's interesting that
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
when you think of body warn cameras
 
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
there's there's actually a lot of
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
information on bodyw warn cameras
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
there's not just police officers doing
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
things there's uh non-law Enforcement
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
Officers civilians in the background
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
there's you know people saying things to
 
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
the police giving information to the
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
police interviews may occur in people's
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
homes um you may end up seeing the
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
interior of a person's home which you
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
know might not be something that you
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
want to necessarily give to a criminal
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
defendant with without any restriction
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
so we attempted to address that and uh
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
proposed Senate Bill
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
362 and I think this is a good first
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
step um you know obviously I would I
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
would have preferred to have seen
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
something comprehensive past but I
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
certainly understand sending it to to
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement accreditation
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
commission to take a look at makes sense
 
00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
um and at least in my mind what this is
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
looking at isn't
 
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily the creation of those body
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
warn cameras in the field but is looking
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
at the issues raised by copying
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
distribution and use in uh in the
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
discovery process in in prosecution so
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
I'm obviously happy to answer a question
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if attor H is anything to
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
add if I could I'm having dà didn't we
 
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
just discuss this like a month ago two
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
months ago is there another bill that
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
came through the house that's in the
 
00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:51.399 align:start position:0%
Senate now that does this there was a
 
00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:53.079 align:start position:0%
bill that came through the house that I
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
think was inexpedient to legislate oh
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
in addition to what attorney Andress
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
said the the big issue one of the big
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
issues I see it is uh is privacy privacy
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
for um the individuals that are on the
 
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
videotape you're seeing them at their
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
worst day they may be having U mental
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
health issues they may be having uh um
 
00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:20.519 align:start position:0%
may be a victim of of a crime and
 
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
frankly there needs to be some control
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
on the distribution of that body Waring
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
camera video uh my worst nightmare uh as
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
far as far as body Waring cameras go is
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
seeing some of the body Waring cameras
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
that I see on on YouTube basically uh
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
and that there should be some protection
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
in place that keeps that from from
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
happening um and I can representative
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
you asked a question about uh input from
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh non-law enforcement when I was
 
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
listening to your question uh I was
 
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about the conversations that
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
I've had with uh other County attorneys
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
local police departments as well as
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
director skippa over at the police
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
standards and and training that's not
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
lost on on any of us um and it's not
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
lost on any of of the discussions that
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
that we've had uh it's been um it's been
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
a point of discussion routinely uh about
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
what the average person thinks ought to
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
happen with body Waring cameras and the
 
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
materials and frankly I'll Circle back
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
to what I just said a moment ago that
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
the I think the average person would
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
expect that there would be some prote
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
ctions for body War camera video when it
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
shows the inside of their house when it
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
shows them having a mental health crisis
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
when it shows their minor son or
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
daughter as a victim uh when it shows an
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
interview that may include personal data
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
name date of birth place of birth items
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
such as that uh that may be recorded
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
when a uh when a police officer does a
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
uh interview um I've seen examples of
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
Bing Waring cameras that uh recorded a
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
um uh a full U strip search pursuant to
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
a search warrant of an individual when
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
they were looking for for drugs frankly
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
that video should have some protection
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
to it because there's full frontal
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
nudity of that individual um those are
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
the type of things that we need to to
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
protect against and uh when this um Bill
 
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh was making its way over to the house
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
I actually talked to director skippa
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
about this and uh he and
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
I think we see the the the benefit of
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
this going to the commission to look at
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
it in totto and try to make things
 
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
better the bill that was written at
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
govern's body warn cameras uh now is a
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
very tight Bill and what I mean by that
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
is there are a lot of restrictions but
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
where it loses its tightness is once
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
that body warant camera material leaves
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
the possession of the state then it
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
loses all of those protections it loses
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
the storage um and uh there have been
 
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
arguments um uh made that once it
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
becomes part of Discovery to a defendant
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
that they can just willy-nilly release
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
it and uh frankly that's that's the
 
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
nightmare of every victim of crime and
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
that's the thing we have to protect
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
against so hopefully the leak uh folks
 
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
can help out with that and uh get back a
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
fairly comprehensive um Amendment for uh
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
um for next
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
session thank you any questions
 
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.189 align:start position:0%
session thank you any questions
representative

00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
Newman I just happen to look at the law
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
that you talked about copying and that
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
they can't do that and and the L it says
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
no person but then it's immediately
 
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
followed by
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
um it says no person including without
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
limitation officers so does that mean
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
they cannot do that can't it sounds like
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
they can't do anything with it as I read
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
it no person can copy body warn camera
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
video but I I can tell you it's
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
routinely happening in New Hampshire
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
because it's being provided as Discovery
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
in criminal cases but it sounds like
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
they added that just to emphasize it and
 
00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:06.039 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from from my position as
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
as County attorney I need to tell the
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
police departments that they have to
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
follow the law and I follow it the way
 
00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:14.039 align:start position:0%
you the way your legis the way our
 
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
legislators wrote it and there's a no
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
person shall copy including without
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
limitation it lists everybody within
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
there and we've had to rely on uh
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
attorney endis has been the lead person
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
doing some litigation we've to rely on
 
00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:32.039 align:start position:0%
court orders to allow us to comply with
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
our Discovery requirements to keep the
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
items private that should be private
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
with a protective order and still
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
maintain our meet our obligations for
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
for Discovery and and I mean I can tell
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
you that language no person including
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement actually comes from the
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
international Chiefs of police model
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
policy the model policy says no officer
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
shall copy which made sense that the
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
rank and officers cannot copy cannot
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
cannot do anything to their body warant
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
camera video but the original language
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
left an opening for their supervisors to
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
copy it through the discovery process
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
and that was amended by the house to get
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
rid of only officers and it it added no
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
person including officers um shall copy
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
it just follow up follow up it sound
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
sounds like that this is an issue that's
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
ongoing so this study is important and
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
it has to be done in a timely manner
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
it's definitely definitely ongoing we
 
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
see it routinely okay thank you so
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
attorney Enders basically every case
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
that you prosecute that has a body War
 
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
camera video you're having to request a
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
protective order and an order to copy it
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
so initially we were fing we were
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
litigating it in in almost every case
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
saying judge we can't copy this the
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
statute says no copying uh we did get an
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
order from one of our judges who says
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
that implicit within 105 D2 is the
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
ability to copy it and provide it in
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
Discovery and indicated but a protective
 
00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:14.919 align:start position:0%
order would be appropriate we then ended
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
up litigating in a number of cases what
 
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
an appropriate protective order would be
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
um based on some of the rulings we got
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
we sat down with the public defender
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
office in in maram county and said let's
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
write up up an agreement for a
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
protective order that we can both live
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
with so that we don't have to bother the
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
court in every single case but if we
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
have cases where people aren't willing
 
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
to sign sort of our standard protective
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
agreement we'll litigate it in every
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
case it's worthwhile to note too that
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
one of the judges in the early part of
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
the litigation commented um that
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
legislative action about this uh would
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
be appreciated I'm paraphrasing what the
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
judge said but that was in one of the
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
orders that was issued by the superior
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
court that you know perhaps the
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to look at this and
 
00:20:06.669 --> 00:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
that's what drove our contact with
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson and got us to where we
 
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.430 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson and got us to where we
are

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
good morning excuse me uh for the record
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
Tom D Roa uh uh be fresh Consulting I'm
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
Association of criminal defense lawyers
 
00:20:47.149 --> 00:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
I put neutral down because there's not
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
much now that this bill has been uh
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
amended to that deals necessarily with
 
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
uh criminality in in the law but we
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
worked with the County attorneys and
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
others uh
 
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
initially in crafting this uh
 
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and I maybe I put neutral
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
probably should maybe still put a POS
 
00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
because when we look at this we still
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
think that as we've heard a little bit
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
this morning it should go through more
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
of a traditional legislative study
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
process where we bring more than just
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement together and bring
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
everybody in to study it so we can hear
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
from everybody and work on something and
 
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
maybe bring something forward that uh
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
goes through a more traditional process
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
and helps all sides uh come together
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
where we came to a bit of an impass uh
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
and earlier this year and this is what's
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
before you now so just wanted to put
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
that on the record uh would be happy to
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
take any questions back to the
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
association if there are
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
any I would just comment that um
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
whatever comes out of the commission is
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
going to come forward as a normal piece
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
of legislation that would then bring
 
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
everybody else to the table so this is
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%

jail contractors in New Hampshire will
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
be using validated screening tools for
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
substance use disorders and mental
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
health disorders for those hous in our
 
00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
jails additionally to encourage warm
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
handoffs from incarceration to Community
 
00:33:32.669 --> 00:33:32.679 align:start position:0%

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
pre-release the use of validated
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire County jails to best practice
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
standards which of course I think we
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
should all be aiming for and ensure that
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
those who are housed are properly
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
screened for sub subsequent assessment
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%

sooner to those being released to
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%

00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
increase the likelihood of Engagement
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
included some of the slides from the
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
report that they did um that I
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
referenced in my testimony I thought
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
that might be helpful for you to have
 
00:37:39.069 --> 00:37:39.079 align:start position:0%
those and if anybody is interested in
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
having the full 91 page report I'm happy
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
to email that to you but I didn't want
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
to clog up your email boxes without um
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
knowing that it's something that you
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:56.920 align:start position:0%

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%

individuals that entered the New
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire jails from 2019 to 2021 were
 
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
matched with Medicaid claims and they
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
used the Medicaid Claim data um in order
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
to do some investigation
 
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
on substance use um disorders and mental
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
93% of the category that they call high
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
utilizers of jail Services were on
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%

serious mental illness more were more
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
likely to have suicidal ideation suicide
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
attempts or intentional self harm and
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
one of the recommendations that came out
 
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
of this study was to increase jail
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and re-entry
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
Services collectively it cost New
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire jails an average of 26 million
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
to incarcerate people for the high just
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
the High
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
utilizers um when individuals with
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
mental illness receive the right
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
services at the right place at the right
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
time fewer folks will end up being
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
repeatedly incarcerated thus costing the
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire County is much less in
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
jail costs and we know that um Senator
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
Whitley talked about the warm handoffs
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
we know that when um
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
somebody um is connected with
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
Services right before they re-enter into
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
the Community if there's a warm handoff
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
into the community rather than just
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
giving them a name of somebody to
 
00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:06.839 align:start position:0%
call that they're more successful with
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
treatment and they're less likely to uh
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
be reincarceration after the
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
fact so we need to reduce criminal
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
justice involvement and increase
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
investments in mental health care even
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
while individuals are incarcerated
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 508 which is closely related
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
to one of the CSG study recommendations
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
would ensure with proper screening tools
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
that individuals receive the proper care
 
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
while in New Hampshire jails the bill
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
also ensures continuity of care and
 
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
could reduce recidivism rates by
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
allowing Community providers into the
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
jails to coordinate those Services as I
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned before somebody re-enters into
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
the community and for those reasons uh
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
Nami New Hampshire urges the committee
 
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
to support this bill and vote it ought
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
to pass and I will answer any questions
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
Muse I I did have one question and you
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
may or may not be the the right person
 
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
to uh to answer this but what exactly is
 
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
a validated screening tool and who does
 
00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:17.510 align:start position:0%
a validated screening tool and who does
the

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
validation there's screening tools that
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
are evidencebased um I don't know who
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
does the
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
validation um but they're standardized
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
training tools that are used throughout
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
you so no further questions thank you
 
00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.829 align:start position:0%
you so no further questions thank you
thank

years to help address substance misuse
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
and addiction in our state uh I don't
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
want to repeat too much of what's been
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
said Miss uh Miss Stevens from my friend
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
Miss Stevens from Nami uh uh used a lot
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
of my talking points but I do want to
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
stress our strong support for this bill
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
as well as the support of stakeholders
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
across the treatment and Recovery
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
community in addition to my own written
 
00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:36.559 align:start position:0%
testimony I've shared with you copy of a
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
joint letter from Health from leading
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
Health Care substance use mental health
 
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery uh organizations
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
around our state all of whom believe
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
that this bill will help to increase
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
access to treatment services for
 
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
individuals uh in our Cor in our County
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
correctional system uh again miss Ste
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
Miss Stevens made the case that you know
 
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
a vast majority of of individuals
 
00:42:59.309 --> 00:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
especially High utilizers in our uh in
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
our County jails have been shown to have
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
either a diagnosis substance use
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
disorder or or uh mental health
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
diagnosed mental health condition or
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
both uh these are people who need uh
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
treatment not they need to be treated
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
not to be punished uh an investment in
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
their in their treatment and their
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
recovery is an investment not just in
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
these individuals but in our counties as
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
a whole knowing that the the cost that
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
our uh uh that our our County Jail
 
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:25.640 align:start position:0%
facilities and ultimately our County
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have to bear to to keep them
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerated again as um as Miss Steven
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
stated uh the CSG study showed that it
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
cost about $6.5 million to house
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
utilizers between 2019 and 2021 about
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
half of this was reimbursed by Medicaid
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
leaving our jails and our County
 
00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers on the hook for the remaining
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh $30 million uh bills such as this
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
which uh uh which increase uh access to
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
treatment through validated screening
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
tools and uh through expanding the
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
workforce of folks who were able to come
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
Behind the Walls to provide Services um
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
this will reduce recidivism and
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh save taxpayer dollars
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh Senator Whitley mentioned the uh
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment that that that she's
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
putting forward uh this is a very minor
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment there was a concern expressed
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
by folks in our treat our recovery
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
Community about an unintended
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
consequence many of them there are
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
currently Arrangements between many
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
recovery centers or recovery Community
 
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
organizations and the county jails in
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
which uh certified community sorry
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
Community Support Recovery workers are
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
already uh serving behind the walls are
 
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
already helping to provide care
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
coordination Services uh they were not
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
covered in the original language of this
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
bill so there was concerned that there
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
would be an unintended consequence of
 
00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
serving to box out uh csws Community
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
recovery support workers uh in favor of
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
um just the the original language which
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
I think said uh license Community
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
licensed Community Based treatment
 
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
provider so again this is just adding
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
csws into the language of the bill uh to
 
00:44:58.589 --> 00:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
to be able to maintain the services that
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
they are currently providing and
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully encourage those kind of
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
arrangements and other facilities as
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
well um I I work this I believe the the
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
county superintendents are comfortable
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
with this language uh the crsw the Comm
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
The Recovery Center certainly support it
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
we had new Futures strongly support it
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
as well again it really is intended just
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
to maintain the services that are
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
currently being provided in some jails
 
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
so we hope you'll consider the amendment
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
pass the bill as amended and I'm happy
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
see none thank you thank
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg good morning I'm Karen
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I'm the policy director at the
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center New Hampshire's
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
protection and advocacy system for
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
people at disabilities and I'm here to
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
encourage you to support
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
s508 um the data that was analyzed and
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
collected by CSG is really telling and
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about the high-end
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
utilizers we're talking about a cohort
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
that that were analyzed in the couple
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
years that they collected data um first
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
of all high jail utilizers were people
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
who were um who had between four and 72
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
entrances into our County Jail system
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
for really lowlevel crimes we're not
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
talking about violent criminals here
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people who are Pres
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
predominantly um being incarcerated for
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
for things like resisting arrest um I'm
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
looking my notes here um public nuisance
 
00:46:39.549 --> 00:46:39.559 align:start position:0%
Criminal Trespass criminal mischief
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
vandalism disorderly conduct things like
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
that so um these are folks who as you
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
also heard disproportionately these
 
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
high-end utilizers um of our County Jail
 
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
system we don't want them to be we'd
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
rather have them be where they need to
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
be in the mental health system right we
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
don't want our our jails are not really
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
equipped nor should they be equipped to
 
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
provide to be a mental health treatment
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
center um this bill would actually help
 
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
to identify those people appropriately
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
and help to transition them into
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatment when they're going
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
to be living on our streets and
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully not returning to jail and
 
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully not living on our streets but
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
living in housing um so we've got you
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
know folks who have had really you know
 
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
high in cycling highly in and out of our
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
County Jail system we know that this is
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
about 2600 people who were the high
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
utilizers at least during that study and
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
I Holly Stevens cited a lot of
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
Statistics one that she didn't cite is
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
that 57% of those High utilizers about
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
1340 people were diagnosed with having a
 
00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
serious mental illness so you know these
 
00:47:47.069 --> 00:47:47.079 align:start position:0%
are folks who would benefit greatly from
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
treatment the other um thing that I want
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
you to keep in mind is that the
 
00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
is in the process of securing um
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully they will secure a de what's
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
called a Medicaid 1115 demonstration
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
project so one of the things that they
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
that the state is looking to do is to
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
get permission from the centers for
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicare Services CMS to be
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
able to secure Federal matching Medicaid
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
funds for services that are provided to
 
00:48:14.829 --> 00:48:14.839 align:start position:0%
people who are incarcerated up to 45
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
days before they are discharged so you
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
know there's a federal there's
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
potentially and I I mean I don't know I
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
I I'm optimistic I think they're going
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
to get this demonstration waiver so
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
there's potential Federal funding for
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
this and it seems like a win-win it's in
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
line with the recommendations for the C
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
from the CSG about you know making sure
 
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
that we're assessing people and doing
 
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
the soft handoffs and also ensuring that
 
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
County Corrections Pro provides access
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
to the Health Services providers and the
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
community that will ultimately be
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
serving these folks um right now the
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
state can't force a County Correction
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
Facility to let providers in this bill
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
take care of security concerns by making
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
sure that anyone coming into County
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
corrections to do this you know soft
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
handoff and connection meets any kind of
 
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
security issues and has been thoroughly
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
screened but it's really but it's really
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
an important step to making sure that
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
their access is granted here so we can
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
get people to where they need to be and
 
00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.870 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
questions

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
repr thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm I just wanted to clarify
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
because I know you're talking about
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
section 115 which is I'm sorry um the
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
115 demonstration there's another one in
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
there um but um what I was under the
 
00:49:43.789 --> 00:49:43.799 align:start position:0%
impression of is that it it essentially
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is with the waiver is
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
to put a pause on people's Medicaid
 
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
status um while they're so when we're
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
talking about 15 days in advance would
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
Services be covered 15 days in advance
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
or is this signing up 15 days in advance
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
45 it would allow the state it's 45 days
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
in advance so this could apply to people
 
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
who are in the state prison system also
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
it would allow um for providers to build
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for services that are provided
 
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
during that 45-day period because
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
generally Medicaid law and rules do not
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
permit um Medicaid coverage of services
 
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
that are provided in locked facilities
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
right thank you so much for that
 
00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.630 align:start position:0%
right thank you so much for that
clarification

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
welcome you enough for the questions oh
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
no representative s thank you and thank
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you use
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
the term serious mental illness could
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
you just give us an example of what
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
distinguishes serious mental illness
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
from um I guess less serious so I I
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
don't have the rule in front of me but
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
we have defined that in our state rules
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
but um to the best of my recollection it
 
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
has to do with not just having a
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of Mental Illness but also
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
functional impairments that result from
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
that mental health diagnosis so that
 
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
could include things like repeat rep
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
entries into the criminal justice system
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
rep repeated hospitalizations due to
 
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
mental illness um other kinds of in
 
00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:09.559 align:start position:0%
inability to um to connect with mental

00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:49.720 align:start position:0%
committee would like to hear it I'll ask
 
00:51:52.349 --> 00:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
it out loud now and you can decide yeah
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
and that's this I can't I want to
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
support all these efforts my question is
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
this I go to an orthopedic surgeon for
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
broken arm six weeks later the cast is
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
off and I'm all right appendix comes out
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
I'm all right mental health can we do
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
anything about it really I somebody
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
who's formed from and lives their life
 
00:52:17.319 --> 00:52:19.069 align:start position:0%
who's formed from and lives their life
with

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
this Affliction handicap whatever you
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
describe their mental Outlook can
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
Society do anything effective about that
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear what these Pro what the
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
probability of success is how I I I
 
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a good sense of the landscape
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
of mental health I guess that's my I
 
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
think that your question applies more to
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
the the mental health that um treatment
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
that's offered broadly versus just a
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
screening at the jail which would be a
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
beginning perhaps so why don't you talk
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
to her and if it sounds like something
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
we don't already know we'd be happy to
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
hear but for now we will um close public
 
00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.030 align:start position:0%
hear but for now we will um close public
hearing

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
hearing

motion yes thank you Mr chair um I think
 
01:39:14.669 --> 01:39:14.679 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
um has some interactions with our
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
current bill package which is actually
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
being heard in the Senate today from my
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
understanding so I think it's wise for
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
us to hold on to it for now and see um
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
what happens with those bills before we
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
make any other further changes to the
 
01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
bill statute thank you representative um
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman um our clerk did a
 
01:39:38.669 --> 01:39:38.679 align:start position:0%
fine job we're just going to inm study
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
these and uh see what the complete
 
01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
package looks like when it comes out
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
from the other side thank you I I would
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%

commend our colleagues in the Senate um
 
01:39:52.709 --> 01:39:52.719 align:start position:0%
just having a belt in suspenders in case
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to get our bail package
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
across the goal line but we did and they
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
have it now so there's no need of this
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
so I would urge everyone to interm study
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill

01:41:14.589 --> 01:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
yeah uh Mr chair I recommend not to
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
pass a second would you like to speak to
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
your motion
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
what this what this uh Bill does is it
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
clears up uh some vagueness in the
 
01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
current law uh that doesn't provide a
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
prob uh probation parole officer uh with
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
legal directions on how to consistently
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
consider Parolees for a reduction in
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
time for their maximum sentences uh it
 
01:41:42.589 --> 01:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
creates an annual audit uh for people
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
under administrative uh supervision uh
 
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
and this is uh the rare bill that
 
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
actually came from a productive study
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
committee so I would urge everyone to
 
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
support it thank you I'll speak to my
 
01:41:55.470 --> 01:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
second um it's important to note that
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
what this bill does in my reading is
 
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
that this isn't really cutting um
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
people's time in jail short what it's
 
01:42:04.990 --> 01:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
doing is if they've already earned
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
parole and they're doing well on parole
 
01:42:10.589 --> 01:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
it allows their parole to be shortened
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
so that resources can be allocated to um
 
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
other people who may need those
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
resources more than someone who's
 
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
actually thriving in the community and
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
doing well after they've been released
 
01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
so I would urge also everyone to support
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
the out to pass motion
 
01:42:23.679 --> 01:42:25.109 align:start position:0%
the out to pass motion
further

01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%

motion yes I would thank you uh what
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it it basically
 
01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
mirrors the alcohol uh transportation of
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
alcohol law in New Hampshire this
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't prohibit you transporting
 
01:43:50.350 --> 01:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
marijuana in your car it only says that
 
01:43:52.350 --> 01:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
if you do it must be in a sealed
 
01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:53.709 align:start position:0%
if you do it must be in a sealed
container

01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:53.719 align:start position:0%
container
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh and if it's not sealed in the
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
original packaging you must transport it
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
in the furthest point away from you uh
 
01:44:00.430 --> 01:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
in the vehicle whether it's in the trunk
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
or the glove box secure uh not in Arms
 
01:44:05.229 --> 01:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
Reach so it basically mirrors the
 
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
Alcohol Law there is a carve out in here
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
for uh prescription marijuana that's
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
that will be allowed thank
 
01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I think there's
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
important um actually representative
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
second no I think this is very important
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
the alcohol law has been around for a
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
long time it helps police officers to be
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
able to enforce the law uh we shouldn't
 
01:44:31.709 --> 01:44:31.719 align:start position:0%
have be allowing people to drive around
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
uh using drugs the testimony the other
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
day from the state police was poly
 
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
accidents are up tremendously a lot of
 
01:44:40.109 --> 01:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
deaths in the in the state of New
 
01:44:41.589 --> 01:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of the use of alcohol
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
and drugs at the same time I think this
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
will help in that situation thank you
 
01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um I think it's important to
 
01:44:52.109 --> 01:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
note that this is um consistency you
 
01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
know we have um um laws against alcohol
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
being open in the car within your reach
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
we have arm uh laws against um
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
distracted driving you have to be
 
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
handsfree you can't have your phone in
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
your hand um this is the same type of
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
thing with marijuana and if you knowe it
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
treats it as though it's a legal
 
01:45:13.629 --> 01:45:13.639 align:start position:0%
substance the fact that it says you can
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
have it but just not within reach it's
 
01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
already taken that next step that many
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
of the people in this committee wanted
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
is to have it recognized as a legal
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
substance just a year ago or so if you
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
had it anywhere in a car you were under
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
arrest now we're taking that step and
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
saying okay if you have it it certainly
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be within Arms Reach unless of
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
course it's your medication it makes
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
that exemption so I think that this
 
01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
gives consistency to our impaired um and
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
distracted driving set of laws and it
 
01:45:44.189 --> 01:45:44.199 align:start position:0%
also takes a step that many people in
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
the committee and and and Society wanted
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
to to say okay we're going to recognize
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
this as a legal substance and treat it
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
as such so I I urge everyone to um vote
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
discussion I also want to note that um
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
that the final bill was actually amended
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
and uh the decision to exclude uh
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana was part of a
 
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
compromise so in the spirit of not
 
01:46:12.510 --> 01:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
messing up a good compromise from the
 
01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
other body hint hint um where I am
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine with this uh and and I
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
also want to say there are a lot of
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
people I know that are uh advocating uh
 
01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
for legalization and for the State uh to
 
01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
begin actually selling uh uh marijuana
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh commercially um I view this as
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
something that actually helps the cause
 
01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've
 
01:46:36.669 --> 01:46:36.679 align:start position:0%
consistently heard over the years on
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is the fact that we don't have
 
01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
a law like this uh is is something that
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
raises a lot of concern for police
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
officers and raises a lot of concerns
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
for citizens who are you know just AR
 
01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
quite sure it's safe to drive on the
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
road sometimes especially on 420 um so
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh I am 100% behind this bill
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
thanks representative s thank you Mr
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
chair I probably should have brought
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
this up when we were having our hearings
 
01:47:04.990 --> 01:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
the other day but I my only I I support
 
01:47:08.189 --> 01:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm curious about in terms of
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
like some of the enforcement just
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
knowing that you know with alcohol it's
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
pretty clear if you have a bottle of
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
Jack in your car it's easy to see a
 
01:47:17.709 --> 01:47:17.719 align:start position:0%
bottle of Jack sitting on the seat but
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
where you know like my kids might be
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
eating gummy bears that are truly gummy
 
01:47:23.709 --> 01:47:23.719 align:start position:0%
bears and some else might be eating
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
gummy bears that are not just Gummy
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
Bears or where someone might be vaping
 
01:47:31.709 --> 01:47:31.719 align:start position:0%
in a car which is legal but the contents
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
of their Vape may or may not you know
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
may be any sort of substance so I I just
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
am trying to in my head and maybe this
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
is a conversation someone will have with
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
me later because I do support the bill
 
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
but I just am trying to figure out how
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
that's going to work no doubt um it'll
 
01:47:49.709 --> 01:47:49.719 align:start position:0%
be a difficult one for law enforcement
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
that may end up getting charged as a
 
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
secondary offense after after they've
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
already had to deal with something else
 
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
such as an accident and they find in the
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
seat you know next to the door that
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
there was marijana or any number of
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances in my opinion that could
 
01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
rise to that where they would say hey
 
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
what is that versus you know a child
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
eating but that's going to be up to the
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
officer to build that case as he as he
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
as he um talks to the operator to to get
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
that Reasonable Suspicion did you have
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
your hand raised yes uh representative
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
sitech I uh voted against this uh in
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
1991 I'm going to vote against it again
 
01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
and I don't mind consent
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
calendar thank you represent Manion
 
01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so a couple things um
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
what what this bill basically is going
 
01:48:38.109 --> 01:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
to accomplish is people not they not
 
01:48:39.790 --> 01:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
going be people driving around smoking
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana while they're driving that's
 
01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
basically the premise of this bill um
 
01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that you need to
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
articulate that something is marijuana
 
01:48:49.229 --> 01:48:49.239 align:start position:0%
before you're able to go into someone's
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
car and sees it uh the same if it was a
 
01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:53.639 align:start position:0%
bag of marijuana I'd have to say based
 
01:48:54.510 --> 01:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
on my
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
experience that that is marijuana in
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
that bag there's an odor it looks like
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
marijuana a gummy bear or a vape absent
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
anything else would not allow an officer
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
to enter the vehicle and and seize that
 
01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
property yeah thank you
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%

01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%

second thank you I'll speak to the
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
motion um after the public hearing and
 
01:50:35.310 --> 01:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
um discussing with various members on
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
both sides of the house um it was
 
01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
decided that the statute or the bill as
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
written was extremely broad um in as far
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
as it almost mandated that um there was
 
01:50:51.310 --> 01:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
cooperation with Federal immigration on
 
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
all the immigration laws it really
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
didn't discuss um on which particular
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
ones it was just very Broad and it gave
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of people pause what the amendment
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
does is the amendment mandates only that
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
local authorities cooperate by honoring
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
detainers and only if a detainer is
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
discovered through an investigation or
 
01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
arrest of a New Hampshire law
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
first in other words they can't be
 
01:51:22.589 --> 01:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
investigating immigration status they
 
01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
can only investigate New Hampshire
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
crimes and if it pops up a detainer then
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
they will honor the
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
detainer um it also
 
01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
specifically um prohibits New Hampshire
 
01:51:37.709 --> 01:51:37.719 align:start position:0%
law enforcement from inquiring about um
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
immigration status which the original
 
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
bill I do not believe
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
did so I believe that this bill um is is
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
something it's it's another compromise
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
from what we got and I hope that um
 
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
everyone can see their way to support
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
this compromise would you like to speak
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
to your second no thank you Mr chairman
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
discussion yeah um we'll take a we'll
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
take a recess until 11:30 exactly to

a privilege here I'm going to read
 
01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
something into the record that I because
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
this question is come up often during
 
01:59:41.229 --> 01:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
this bill we what what exactly what's a
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
detainer anyway and we've heard talk
 
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
that you know these are civil processes
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
and this is um from the from the ice
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
website it's called detainer
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
101 says whenever possible ice Works
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
closely with local law enforcement
 
01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
Partners to enhance Public Safety by

keeping criminals off the streets
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
detainers are an effective tool in
 
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
keeping criminals out of local
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
communities by allowing ice officers to
 
02:00:09.910 --> 02:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
take custody of criminal non-citizens
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
within the confines of a jail what is a

cause to believe are removable
 
02:00:28.069 --> 02:00:28.079 align:start position:0%

Immigration and Customs Enforcement

lodges detainers on individuals who have

who ice believes has probable cause to

are removable
 
02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
non-citizens so they're not civil the
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
detainer ask the other law enforcement
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
agency to notify ice before a removable
 
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
individual is released from custody and
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
to maintain custody of the non-citizen
 
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
for a brief period of time so that ice
 
02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
can take custody of that person in a
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
safe and secure setting upon release
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
from that agency's custody when law

enforcement agencies fail to honor

serious criminal offenders into the
 
02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
streets it undermines isa's ability to
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
protect the public safety and carry out
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
its mission for decades immigration
 
02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
officers have used detainers as a
 
02:01:14.550 --> 02:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
collaborative law enforcement tool to
 
02:01:16.270 --> 02:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
request critical law enforcement
 
02:01:18.669 --> 02:01:18.679 align:start position:0%
cooperation notifying ice of upcoming
 
02:01:20.669 --> 02:01:20.679 align:start position:0%
release of a non-citizen who has been
 
02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
arrested for a criminal viol ation
 
02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
unrelated to their immigration status
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
underscores the importance of
 
02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:28.719 align:start position:0%
information sharing between partners who
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
ultimately share the same goal to serve
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
and protect our
 
02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
communities as noted above the detainer
 
02:01:36.629 --> 02:01:36.639 align:start position:0%
serves as both a request for advanced
 
02:01:38.910 --> 02:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
notification of release and a request to
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
hold the subject for a short period of
 
02:01:43.629 --> 02:01:43.639 align:start position:0%
time enabling ice to take custody ice
 
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
issues detainers based on a finding by a
 
02:01:47.790 --> 02:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
trained immigration officer that there
 
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
is probable cause to believe an
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
individual is a removable noncitizen
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
like all law enforcement agencies ice
 
02:01:56.910 --> 02:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
considers all evidence at its disposal
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
to determine if probable cause for
 
02:02:01.149 --> 02:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
removal exists including various
 
02:02:04.270 --> 02:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
databases and electronic data probable
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
cause is the same legal standard that
 
02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
other law enforcement agencies must meet
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
to make an
 
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
arrest it is important to note that not
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
everyone interviewed by is is detained
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
or removed deported everyone receives
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
due process and Ice focuses its
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
resources on removing criminals and
 
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
Public Safety threats to that end ice
 
02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
collaborates with all law enforcement
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
agencies to help ensure that
 
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
non-citizens who may pose a public
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
safety threat are not released onto the
 
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
streets to reoffend and potentially harm
 
02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
individuals living within our
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
communities however in some cases state
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
or local laws ordinances or policies
 
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
restrict or prohibit cooperation with
 
02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:45.320 align:start position:0%
ice in other cases jurisdictions choose
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
to willfully decline ice detainers or
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
requests for notification and re release
 
02:02:54.270 --> 02:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
removable non-citizens back into the
 
02:02:56.589 --> 02:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
community when criminal non-citizens are
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
released from local or state custody
 
02:03:00.430 --> 02:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
they have the opportunity to reoffend
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
ice must then expend additional more
 
02:03:04.030 --> 02:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
extensive resources to mitigate
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
potential risks and make arrests in a
 
02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.270 align:start position:0%
potential risks and make arrests in a
community

02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
setting often ice is unable to locate a
 
02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
released non-citizen before that
 
02:03:13.870 --> 02:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
individual commits another crime it is
 
02:03:16.109 --> 02:03:16.119 align:start position:0%
safer for everyone if ice takes custody
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
of a non-citizen in the controlled
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
environment of another law enforcement
 
02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
agency as opposed to visiting a non
 
02:03:24.109 --> 02:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
citizens residence place of work or
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
other public area arresting a criminal
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
in a safety security and privacy of jail
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
is always the best
 
02:03:33.069 --> 02:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
option I feel like that pretty much
 
02:03:35.709 --> 02:03:35.719 align:start position:0%
clears up what a detainer is
 
02:03:35.719 --> 02:03:38.910 align:start position:0%
clears up what a detainer is
representative

02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:42.069 --> 02:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
Newman I have a question first so that
 
02:03:45.390 --> 02:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty good description of
 
02:03:50.549 --> 02:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
um the mission of of ice um what I what
 
02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about is so they have
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
their request in the federal and all of
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
the things you
 
02:03:58.750 --> 02:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
described what I didn't hear in there
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
was when the
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
local entity is going to
 
02:04:09.069 --> 02:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
detain the person that what what right
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
do they have since I have some
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
information here that that detention for
 
02:04:17.549 --> 02:04:17.559 align:start position:0%
48 hours is a new
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
arrest and it's arrest that's based upon
 
02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
what that
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
entity has to do to do a legal arrest of
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
an individual so I did not hear anything
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
about that and uh if you if I may I'd
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
like to read just something that I found
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
on the Miami law review that talks about
 
02:04:42.510 --> 02:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah sure man sure it says courts
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
have held that an additional 48 hour
 
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
detention constitutes a new arrest this
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
new arrest is a seizure under the Fourth
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment and thus requires independent
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
Authority the United States Supreme
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
Court in Horton versus California said
 
02:04:58.270 --> 02:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
that the seizures
 
02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
conducted uh outside the judicial
 
02:05:02.669 --> 02:05:02.679 align:start position:0%
process without the prior approval of a
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
judge or magistrate are per se unre
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
unreasonable subject only to a few
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
specifically well delineated exceptions
 
02:05:13.229 --> 02:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
yet this new arrest unlike a criminal
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
arrest violates the Fourth Amendment
 
02:05:17.229 --> 02:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
when there is no judicial a warrant or
 
02:05:20.109 --> 02:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
probable cause for a criminal offense
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
and I just believe that in there's more
 
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
to it but I'll just leave it at that and
 
02:05:26.549 --> 02:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
I think that there's a potential there
 
02:05:29.870 --> 02:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
that there's liability for all of these
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have put in these
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
laws that say they will they maybe they
 
02:05:40.030 --> 02:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
will all the time but this kind of law
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
they've decided what they needed to do
 
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
for their community and I feel that they
 
02:05:46.549 --> 02:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
face liability so I have an issue with
 
02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
voting for this law thank you very much
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you well clearly the case that you
 
02:05:52.990 --> 02:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
just cited didn't go to the US Supreme
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
Court if it did it was struck down
 
02:05:56.109 --> 02:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
because ice detainers are still
 
02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
happening um second this would take any
 
02:06:03.310 --> 02:06:03.320 align:start position:0%
liability away from a town because
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
they're following state law could I
 
02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
could I just comment about that I mean
 
02:06:10.669 --> 02:06:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.629 --> 02:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
says the new arrest is
 
02:06:17.629 --> 02:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
a is a is a seizure under the Fourth
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment or so the never mind I'll take
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
it back I'm going yeah well know what
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
you're reading is a lawyer's opinion in
 
02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
an article of a court opinion that we
 
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
don't know the status of or what what
 
02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
hardly anything I mean but we do know
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
that Isis is still operating and they're
 
02:06:33.709 --> 02:06:33.719 align:start position:0%
still issuing detainers so the Supreme
 
02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:35.719 align:start position:0%
Court hasn't ruled that way otherwise
 
02:06:37.390 --> 02:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be doing that but to back
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
to your point about liability if the
 
02:06:41.229 --> 02:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
state follow if the town or municipality
 
02:06:42.589 --> 02:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
follows the state law they're not
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
subject to liability as long as they do
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
so um in a in not in a halfhazard manner
 
02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
and they follow the law so they would be
 
02:06:52.510 --> 02:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
have sovereign immunity based on that if
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
they were to set their own policy that
 
02:06:56.589 --> 02:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
says we're not going to honor detainers
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
and they let someone out and that person
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
murders someone I would say they have a
 
02:07:01.629 --> 02:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
greater liability there than they would
 
02:07:04.109 --> 02:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
if they follow the law and hold someone
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
but that's well you and I can
 
02:07:08.589 --> 02:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree since since I
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that we be reading things
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
into the record but I will follow up oh
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
no the Supreme Court thank you
 
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah sure what that means further
 
02:07:22.109 --> 02:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Pro
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
he oh thanks I'm out of practice um good
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
wait to get
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
him I
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
know um so we're only looking at felons
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
and nothing if they're just illegal is
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
their only crime
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
right no it doesn't talk about felons
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
not it just talks about what the
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
detainer is other words so so first of
 
02:07:50.589 --> 02:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
all let me back up New Hampshire police
 
02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
would only be dealing with is if they
 
02:07:53.870 --> 02:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
arrested someone for a violation of New
 
02:07:55.790 --> 02:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law they're not just going up
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
to people checking immigration status
 
02:07:58.990 --> 02:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
you know let me check and see if there's
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
a detainer for you so that's clear in
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
here that they can only do it as part of
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
that second if there's a detainer in
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
there from Ice that means ice has
 
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
already determined this person is a
 
02:08:10.669 --> 02:08:10.679 align:start position:0%
removable alien that means that they are
 
02:08:16.109 --> 02:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:19.870 --> 02:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
M so I I would uh urge my colleagues to
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh support uh the amendment uh it does
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh create uh a better Bill uh but I
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe that the amendment uh does
 
02:08:36.030 --> 02:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
enough to actually address uh what I
 
02:08:38.270 --> 02:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
feel are significant issues with the
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
bill um so uh I want to thank uh the
 
02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union and the
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire immigrants rights network
 
02:08:49.589 --> 02:08:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh for actually helping me draft an
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
alternate Amendment which we will not
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
see today uh that actually addresses uh
 
02:08:56.589 --> 02:08:56.599 align:start position:0%
many of the problematic issues in the
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill that uh that I think we would have
 
02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:00.589 align:start position:0%
bill that uh that I think we would have
supported

02:09:00.589 --> 02:09:00.599 align:start position:0%
supported
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
um in my mind that that was the start of
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
a possible compromise on this on this
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
particular bill um what the amendment
 
02:09:13.589 --> 02:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
before us now uh would do is make
 
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
changes to uh one of four sections of
 
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
the bill uh it leaves uh the other four
 
02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
sections in place
 
02:09:25.390 --> 02:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
um the enforcement section uh is
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
especially problematic um during
 
02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard uh uh from uh from
 
02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement Officers we got
 
02:09:35.069 --> 02:09:35.079 align:start position:0%
communication from the chief of police
 
02:09:37.950 --> 02:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
of Manchester from my chief of police uh
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth that they were opposed to
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
this bill one of the reasons they were
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to it is because they feel it
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
will create uh additional work and force
 
02:09:47.159 --> 02:09:47.950 align:start position:0%
will create uh additional work and force
rep

02:09:47.950 --> 02:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
rep
 
02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:50.559 align:start position:0%
prioritization of uh some of the
 
02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
activities that they officers are
 
02:09:55.229 --> 02:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
engaged in and it also has potential to
 
02:09:57.549 --> 02:09:57.559 align:start position:0%
create uh more liability not only for
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
the department but their town and I know
 
02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy uh has some
 
02:10:04.270 --> 02:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
additional information to share with us
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
02:10:07.950 --> 02:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the changes that it
 
02:10:11.229 --> 02:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
does make uh to to section three uh
 
02:10:14.189 --> 02:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
removing the extremely vague language
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
around uh uh best efforts uh of uh Law
 
02:10:20.589 --> 02:10:20.599 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers to comply I think
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
was a uh was a good start uh but
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
substituting it with something that's
 
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
almost as vague um uh I'm not sure
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily helps uh the situation at
 
02:10:37.549 --> 02:10:37.559 align:start position:0%
all um we also we also have a situation
 
02:10:42.149 --> 02:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
where we are once again
 
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
in enforcing inflicting whatever you
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
want to call it um the beliefs of what
 
02:10:50.549 --> 02:10:50.559 align:start position:0%
we think and conquered on our
 
02:10:50.559 --> 02:10:52.069 align:start position:0%
we think and conquered on our
communities

02:10:52.069 --> 02:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
so another way to approach this and the
 
02:10:56.910 --> 02:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
way that uh we we could approach it
 
02:10:58.350 --> 02:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
maybe in an alternate Amendment an
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
alternate universe is to actually uh
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
authorize towns to prohib to actually
 
02:11:06.510 --> 02:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
create policies that would allow them to
 
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
do some of these things in this in this
 
02:11:11.549 --> 02:11:11.559 align:start position:0%
bill so rather than uh outright prohibit
 
02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
them from implementing uh Sanctuary City
 
02:11:18.189 --> 02:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
policies allow them to implement
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
policies that um support uh some of the
 
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
objectives that are outlined in this
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
bill so in other words enabling
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
legislation that allows them to do that
 
02:11:30.229 --> 02:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a different approach I
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
think it's probably more of a New
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire approach uh you know we like
 
02:11:36.750 --> 02:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
to talk a lot about local control and
 
02:11:38.669 --> 02:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
things like that what it does is it puts
 
02:11:41.229 --> 02:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
the decision back into the hands of
 
02:11:43.149 --> 02:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
communities um I think that's a
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable approach and uh I'm a little
 
02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
disappointed that it's you know not the
 
02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
approach uh we're taking and the
 
02:11:54.750 --> 02:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment that's before us
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
now thank you who um Whoever has their
 
02:12:01.709 --> 02:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
phone dinging if you could please mute
 
02:12:04.189 --> 02:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
your phone um or whether it's a computer
 
02:12:05.310 --> 02:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
whatever it is if you could just please
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that that volume is turned off
 
02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:08.350 align:start position:0%
make sure that that volume is turned off
thank

02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:12:10.510 --> 02:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
you I didn't hear the dinging but I
 
02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
heard that now I forgot what I was going
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
to say um I didn't listen to the okay uh
 
02:12:16.510 --> 02:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
did I understand you
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
correctly um that few minutes ago you
 
02:12:29.229 --> 02:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
said this only
 
02:12:33.229 --> 02:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
applies to people who are charged with a
 
02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
crime because did I understand that
 
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
correctly because that's not that it
 
02:12:40.830 --> 02:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
does seem to be what the original Bill
 
02:12:45.150 --> 02:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
intends for but not the amendment the
 
02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:46.709 align:start position:0%
intends for but not the amendment the
[Music]

02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
um it's uh line 24 on the front page
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply to a witness or
 
02:12:56.430 --> 02:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
victim of a crime unless an immigration
 
02:12:58.030 --> 02:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
detainer is on
 
02:13:02.109 --> 02:13:02.119 align:start position:0%
file um and in that case an option is if
 
02:13:03.870 --> 02:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
the totality of circumstances would lead
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
a reasonable officer to conclude the
 
02:13:07.149 --> 02:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
person's release would put the public in
 
02:13:10.109 --> 02:13:10.119 align:start position:0%
danger that's am I misunderstanding
 
02:13:12.390 --> 02:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's not in the original Bill and and
 
02:13:15.549 --> 02:13:15.559 align:start position:0%
it seems like the original
 
02:13:21.310 --> 02:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
Bill simply doesn't apply this policy to
 
02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:23.030 align:start position:0%
Bill simply doesn't apply this policy to
to

02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:13:25.950 --> 02:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
victims or Witnesses for the sake of
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
keeping them in the country cor yeah the
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
the original bill um Exempted victims
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
and Witnesses totally from um being
 
02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
being subjected to honoring of a ice
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
detainer against them um and the part
 
02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's added is that the officer has to
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
in other words if you have someone who's
 
02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
here because they they um or someone
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
you're involved with in law enforcement
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
and they say hey I'm a witness to that
 
02:13:55.390 --> 02:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
salt and Battery I saw him hit her and
 
02:13:57.069 --> 02:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
there's an ice detainer on him that you
 
02:13:58.310 --> 02:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
find out because when you enter
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
everyone's name and the Witnesses in the
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
computer well they would get to in the
 
02:14:05.149 --> 02:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
ice detainer was because they were
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
wanted in bogot Columbia for murder they
 
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
would get to stay because they're a
 
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
witness to an assault and battery that's
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
the scales aren't very good there so
 
02:14:15.430 --> 02:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
this what this does is let them look at
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
the totality of circumstances if
 
02:14:20.270 --> 02:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
someone's wanted from by ice for murder
 
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
or one of the crimes that they would be
 
02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
a witness to um a decision has to be
 
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
made and it doesn't say that they'll
 
02:14:28.549 --> 02:14:28.559 align:start position:0%
turn them right over to ice I believe it
 
02:14:31.870 --> 02:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
says they should contact ice and because
 
02:14:34.510 --> 02:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
if you go on the ice website and I hate
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
referring to websites but if you go on
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
the ice website it says if you have an
 
02:14:39.229 --> 02:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
issue with someone who's going to be a
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
witness call for law enforcement call us
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
and we'll work on it so I believe that
 
02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
ice works with local law enforcement so
 
02:14:47.830 --> 02:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
that they're not just taking people who
 
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
are witnesses and victims and throwing
 
02:14:51.229 --> 02:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
them right out
 
02:14:54.589 --> 02:14:54.599 align:start position:0%
so is it accurate that this doesn't just
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
apply to people who've well been
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
arrested because it this would mean
 
02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
we're including potentially a victim of
 
02:15:03.629 --> 02:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
a crime and I think the word say wanted
 
02:15:03.639 --> 02:15:05.189 align:start position:0%
a crime and I think the word say wanted
for

02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:15:09.229 --> 02:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
involvement which is not arrested and
 
02:15:12.189 --> 02:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
it's possible they're a witness in that
 
02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
situation or something right this it
 
02:15:17.350 --> 02:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
sounds like you
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
can have um it sounds like this SE
 
02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment would apply to you even
 
02:15:28.270 --> 02:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
crime so the the honoring of a detainer
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
as far as law enforcement getting into
 
02:15:36.030 --> 02:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a detainer
 
02:15:37.950 --> 02:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
against somebody would only be checked
 
02:15:40.189 --> 02:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
if someone was arrested for a crime if
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
someone comes forward and they're a
 
02:15:43.310 --> 02:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
victim of a crime or a witness to a
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
crime and during that the police
 
02:15:47.310 --> 02:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
officers discover that there's an ice
 
02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
detainer on them that means they're not
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
doing an investigation to whether this
 
02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
person person is um Wanted by ice it
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
just comes to the police attention
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
because they're a victim or a witness at
 
02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
that point we've that the original Bill
 
02:16:03.069 --> 02:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
had an exemption where these people
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
could not be um or the ice detainers
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
would not be honored on this class of
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
people if they were witnesses to these
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
or victims of these crimes the amended
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
version says that if they're wanted by
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
ice for something that's similar to what
 
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
they're victim or witness to a
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
determination has to be made whether how
 
02:16:24.030 --> 02:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
important they are as a victim or a
 
02:16:26.069 --> 02:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
witness versus how dangerous they
 
02:16:28.390 --> 02:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
released to public would be so to
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
clarify down what I think you're trying
 
02:16:32.830 --> 02:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
to say is no it it doesn't necessarily
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
only apply to people who are under
 
02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
arrest it this exemption was in the
 
02:16:42.429 --> 02:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
original Bill I just took the exemption
 
02:16:44.190 --> 02:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
said wait a minute it can't be a blanket
 
02:16:45.589 --> 02:16:45.599 align:start position:0%
exemption they need to look at what the
 
02:16:47.349 --> 02:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
person's wanted for so that's the change
 
02:16:49.469 --> 02:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
from the original
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
Bill further discussion how how is it
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
that that the just like an example if
 
02:16:58.910 --> 02:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
you could how would they determine that
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
there's a detainer on file if they're
 
02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
not doing a search for victims or
 
02:17:07.070 --> 02:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
witnesses that they're engaging with
 
02:17:09.270 --> 02:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
generally speaking when the police
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
encounter someone and they're doing
 
02:17:12.270 --> 02:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
police reports and they enter their
 
02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
names into the system and they do a
 
02:17:15.150 --> 02:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
wants and warrants check and it would
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
come up with a a a nice detainer um is
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
that correct uh rep represent man
 
02:17:23.070 --> 02:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
yeah that could happen it it hasn't been
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
my practice it would have to be a triple
 
02:17:26.589 --> 02:17:26.599 align:start position:0%
ey wouldn't it yeah I wouldn't run a
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
check on a victim or a witness to see if
 
02:17:31.469 --> 02:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
they want it anywhere necessarily yeah
 
02:17:32.990 --> 02:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
that generally wouldn't be my practice
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
Yeah so it would only be if it happened
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
to come to your attention somehow or
 
02:17:37.990 --> 02:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
another um so in order to find that out
 
02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
you'd have to actually I think run a
 
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
triple I which is a Interstate wants and
 
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
warrants check so 90% of the time this
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
isn't going to happen I believe that
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
this is here but if the person who's a
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
witness or a victim let's say victim of
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
human trafficking yeah maybe doesn't
 
02:17:55.950 --> 02:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
speak English or has a certain
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
complexion would that motivate someone
 
02:18:01.110 --> 02:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
to want to do this triple I check is it
 
02:18:03.429 --> 02:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
possible that it could
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
be applied in a biased or presumptuous
 
02:18:10.309 --> 02:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
way and also just I I'm not hearing that
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
this I'm not hearing any any information
 
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
contrary to the reality that this
 
02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't just apply to people charged
 
02:18:19.790 --> 02:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
with crimes I want to make sure I
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
totally understand this doesn't just
 
02:18:23.669 --> 02:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
apply to people charged with crimes the
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
amendment no the to be very clear the
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
amendment does not it only applies to
 
02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519 align:start position:0%
people charged with crimes in so far as
 
02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
honoring ice detainers this part down
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
here that says that an exemption for
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
people and other words if this person is
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
also a victim or a witness it will not
 
02:18:41.709 --> 02:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
apply to them that's what the original
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
Bill said and that still applies except
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
for there has to be some judgment call
 
02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
made as to whether or not what they're
 
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
wanted for is Worthy of saying okay you
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
need to stay here for this prosecution
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
versus turning you over to ice because
 
02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
you are wanted by Ice I think that
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
pretty much explains it so um and with
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
regard to your question about
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
complexions and things of that nature
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
that would be assuming that um that
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
someone's racist and that they're doing
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
enforcing the law for racist purposes so
 
02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't uh put my head in that
 
02:19:16.629 --> 02:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
position so representative
 
02:19:21.190 --> 02:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
Newman I that that just leads me it does
 
02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
when a agency gets a
 
02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:26.669 align:start position:0%
when a agency gets a
uh

02:19:26.669 --> 02:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
detainer do they do they get it
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
primarily for someone who's incarcerated
 
02:19:33.910 --> 02:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
already or are there other ways that
 
02:19:36.509 --> 02:19:36.519 align:start position:0%
they get it I
 
02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
mean when when I asked the questions of
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor I asked them how do
 
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
you how do you become come to know about
 
02:19:45.469 --> 02:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
what the citizenship of the person is
 
02:19:47.389 --> 02:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
and they say well they may say I'm here
 
02:19:48.750 --> 02:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
I don't have a license because I'm an
 
02:19:51.150 --> 02:19:51.160 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrant and and whatever so
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to clear up about how in
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
fact do police come to know about these
 
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
detainers that they're required to uh
 
02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
deal with so when you arrest someone
 
02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
generally speaking when they place under
 
02:20:06.670 --> 02:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
arrest you would print their record and
 
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
it would trigger a a u a want warrant
 
02:20:11.469 --> 02:20:11.479 align:start position:0%
from a federal
 
02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
agency so there's no like one800 number
 
02:20:16.510 --> 02:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
you can call and check and see someone's
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
citizenship there's there's no way for
 
02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
an officer to determine someone's
 
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
citizenship unless there wanted by the
 
02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
federal government otherwise there just
 
02:20:26.110 --> 02:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
isn't anyway um so generally speaking
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
you would become aware of uh an ice
 
02:20:31.710 --> 02:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
detainer once someone's already under
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
arrest unless they came forward
 
02:20:34.590 --> 02:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
themselves and said hey I have a ice
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
detainer Army ice is looking for me
 
02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative man you want to add to
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah I could and so if I run into
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
somebody um and they tell me I'm not a
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
citizen I'm here illegally and no ice
 
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
detainer pops up they're free to go I
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
don't enforce federal law so that's what
 
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
would happen and I wouldn't be inquiring
 
02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
that but if they offered that
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
information there'd be no action that I
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
would take unless ice had a detainer on
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
them so do you have to do that in do you
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
have to where do you go to check that
 
02:21:01.309 --> 02:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
out to see does it just come up with
 
02:21:02.910 --> 02:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
like his arrest record or something like
 
02:21:04.349 --> 02:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
that it comes up that there's so if
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
you're running the person's name if it
 
02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
want a car stop or if you're arresting
 
02:21:09.389 --> 02:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
somebody or whatnot it might come up
 
02:21:11.950 --> 02:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
there if it's in the system through uh
 
02:21:15.309 --> 02:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
through spots spots terminal which is uh
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
run by the state police so the state
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
police terminal ties into the to the
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
interstate um compact terminal so if
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
there wants out of any state in the
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
country when they run them generally
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
speaking it should pop up and that goes
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
for federal warrant is too so when you
 
02:21:33.230 --> 02:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
run somebody it's going to pop if it's
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
entered so that when when that pops up
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
you do you do you check now then what
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
would he do would he he would make the
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
arrest at that time just because that's
 
02:21:45.150 --> 02:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
there or no no he would call Immigration
 
02:21:46.830 --> 02:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
first and say do you want to come get
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
this person and immigration would either
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
say yes or no if they say know you let
 
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
the person go so this would be done on
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
the roadside or he'd arrest him to take
 
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
him or would he just detain him to take
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
him to the station no I don't believe so
 
02:22:02.830 --> 02:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
rep have you ever had a an ice detainer
 
02:22:04.590 --> 02:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
I have not had I have not run into one
 
02:22:06.429 --> 02:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
ice detainer in my career in three years
 
02:22:10.710 --> 02:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
myself yeah I I I'm pretty sure that um
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
they would hold them on the roadside for
 
02:22:15.030 --> 02:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
a few minutes it takes and and then cut
 
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
them loose because they're just being
 
02:22:17.950 --> 02:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
temporarily detained until they can
 
02:22:20.910 --> 02:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
ascertain the status of that so so and
 
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
they under arrest for in New Hampshire
 
02:22:24.750 --> 02:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
crime they're going back to jail and
 
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
then they'll wait for the ice detainer
 
02:22:29.469 --> 02:22:29.479 align:start position:0%
before they're bailed out to be uh
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
resolved that's what I understand and I
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
think even the thing that I read even
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
though it was only by a law school that
 
02:22:38.110 --> 02:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
that the detainer there was a case and I
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it made it to the
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court but I'll check on that
 
02:22:44.670 --> 02:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
yeah but that says that that when when
 
02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
they just make a request to view it
 
02:22:50.590 --> 02:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't been judicially reviewed so that
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
when they decide when a when a police
 
02:22:57.150 --> 02:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
entity decides to make the arrest it has
 
02:22:57.160 --> 02:22:58.030 align:start position:0%
entity decides to make the arrest it has
to

02:22:58.030 --> 02:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
be based on their issue and not
 
02:23:03.070 --> 02:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily just a request from that
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
that at least that's my opinion thank
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
you very much representative wheeler
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
then represent Mania well I have a
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
question about this conversation that's
 
02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
going on uh so everybody who comes here
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
illegally isn't necessarily issued an
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
ice detainer no so what is the process
 
02:23:24.630 --> 02:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
by which ice issues those detainers I
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
think it was part of what I just read
 
02:23:28.349 --> 02:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
they look at um is there a reason is the
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
person removable that means if they
 
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
committed a crime that would that would
 
02:23:34.349 --> 02:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
justify removing them from the country
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
if they are removable they will put a
 
02:23:38.349 --> 02:23:38.359 align:start position:0%
detainer on them then they pick them up
 
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
and I believe I believe they're entitled
 
02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
to a hearing before an immigration judge
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
unless there's already an order to
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
remove in place so either way it's going
 
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
to be reviewed by immigration judge
 
02:23:53.309 --> 02:23:53.319 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought I just wanted that
 
02:23:55.070 --> 02:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
reinforced and then I guess you know
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative man you said you've never
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
faced an immigration deter you know not
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
once in my career I can tell you though
 
02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
just to to answer representative
 
02:24:06.269 --> 02:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
Newman's question technically you can
 
02:24:07.950 --> 02:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
arrest on New Hampshire for violation so
 
02:24:09.550 --> 02:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
if you stop some in a car for speeding
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
or stop sign violation technically you
 
02:24:13.630 --> 02:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
can arrest them on that violation I
 
02:24:15.429 --> 02:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
don't think it's ever been done but you
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
can do that so it's not like we're just
 
02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
stopping people on the street and having
 
02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
a conversation with them
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
and we run their name nilly Willy and it
 
02:24:25.070 --> 02:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
pops up the detainer now we're Tak them
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
into custody just for that detainer
 
02:24:29.309 --> 02:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
there would be another reason for it so
 
02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
you have a a a New Hampshire law
 
02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
violation that you can arrest them on um
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
before you be taking any action it's
 
02:24:38.590 --> 02:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
been my experience and it's my
 
02:24:40.590 --> 02:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
understanding that that the ice phone
 
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
number is answered promptly and they
 
02:24:45.070 --> 02:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
have Regional sections and they'll say
 
02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we're going to come get this guy
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
right away or no never mind we don't
 
02:24:50.110 --> 02:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
have the staff and then you just let him
 
02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:50.870 align:start position:0%
have the staff and then you just let him
go

02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
after you make your report saying they
 
02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
told me to let them go representative
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um just two
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
points I wanted to make and this is just
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
from my own understanding in my Googling
 
02:25:05.950 --> 02:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
on my phone during this conversation but
 
02:25:08.469 --> 02:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh I think part of the potential concern
 
02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
is that um while it seems like isce is
 
02:25:13.630 --> 02:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
only issuing criminal detainers right
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
now I guess in the previous
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
administration that they also issued
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
civil detainers and so if this bill B
 
02:25:22.910 --> 02:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify between civil and
 
02:25:24.670 --> 02:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
criminal um that it could have a
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
different intended impact um than we're
 
02:25:29.389 --> 02:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
talking about today um and then also
 
02:25:31.230 --> 02:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
just a point that when these criminal
 
02:25:33.309 --> 02:25:33.319 align:start position:0%
detainers are issued um they don't
 
02:25:36.269 --> 02:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
require the same probable probable CA
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
standard or judicial review that a
 
02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:44.910 --> 02:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
requires I believe didn't I just read
 
02:25:46.830 --> 02:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
that it says they require probable cost
 
02:25:48.990 --> 02:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
to issue a
 
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
detainer yeah pretty sure that's what I
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
just read from the ice website that they
 
02:25:54.670 --> 02:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
have to have probable cause they
 
02:25:56.349 --> 02:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
specifically said the same standard to
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
make an arrest um with regard to whether
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
or not it's a criminal or civil detainer
 
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
I do not know that that an officer can
 
02:26:06.910 --> 02:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
see that um on their screen what type of
 
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
detainer it is I believe they have to
 
02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
actually call to find out I don't think
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
it gives a lot of information about what
 
02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
the detainer is for since nobody here
 
02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
has seen one I don't think have you no
 
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
represent Stone the uh one involvement I
 
02:26:25.550 --> 02:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
had with an ice detainer was actually
 
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
triggered from uh aphis running a set of
 
02:26:29.830 --> 02:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
prints and that was on a deported felon
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
which means they had already been
 
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
adjudicated in our Judicial System
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
deported and somehow found their way
 
02:26:38.429 --> 02:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
back to New Hampshire and when the
 
02:26:40.269 --> 02:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
prince ran it triggered the ice
 
02:26:41.630 --> 02:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
notification in the detainer and they
 
02:26:43.309 --> 02:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
were within 24 hours they were there to
 
02:26:47.070 --> 02:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.269 --> 02:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
you further discussion right
 
02:26:51.269 --> 02:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
representative did you just the comment
 
02:26:51.279 --> 02:26:56.630 align:start position:0%
representative did you just the comment
about

02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:00.429 --> 02:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
oh the comment about I mean in general
 
02:27:03.990 --> 02:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
there is a um a person who can be
 
02:27:07.269 --> 02:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
without be undocumented in the country
 
02:27:09.429 --> 02:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
and that's not a
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
crime because they have to have they may
 
02:27:15.269 --> 02:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
have come in Legally and then overstate
 
02:27:17.230 --> 02:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
it so it's a civil problem it's not a
 
02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
crime it's not automatically going to
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
give them a detainer
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
right don't know depends
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
anyway thank
 
02:27:28.150 --> 02:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
you yeah you're right that detainers
 
02:27:30.309 --> 02:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
don't just
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
yeah in other words I think the bottom
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
line for this is that if there's an
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
detainer been
 
02:27:39.429 --> 02:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
issued the immigration for wants this
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
person for either to be deported because
 
02:27:44.309 --> 02:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
they've already done something worthy of
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
deportation or to question them about
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
something worthy of that that's a crime
 
02:27:51.389 --> 02:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
um and I just read for everyone right
 
02:27:53.870 --> 02:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
off this administration's and let me
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
tell you to represent Murray's point I
 
02:27:58.389 --> 02:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
was able to dig up an archived of the
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
page under the previous administration
 
02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't as friendly this one is
 
02:28:05.349 --> 02:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
much more friendly and more immigrant
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
neutral and it it
 
02:28:09.469 --> 02:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
said um I don't think it used the word
 
02:28:11.389 --> 02:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
alien anywhere in it and it but it still
 
02:28:13.710 --> 02:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
says the bottom line facts if someone
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
has a detainer it's a crime and we're
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
looking for them and they even go so far
 
02:28:20.269 --> 02:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
as to tell people please stop making
 
02:28:21.750 --> 02:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
these things that don't cooperate with
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
us cuz you're making it more dangerous
 
02:28:25.590 --> 02:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
for us when we hear police Chiefs say I
 
02:28:29.070 --> 02:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
don't want the my community to be
 
02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
disturbed and uprooted by all this it's
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
much easier for ice to come grab someone
 
02:28:36.429 --> 02:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
who's already at the police department
 
02:28:38.349 --> 02:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
then for the ice to get there because
 
02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
ice is notified when the name is run Hey
 
02:28:42.429 --> 02:28:42.439 align:start position:0%
where's the guy you guys had oh we cut
 
02:28:44.349 --> 02:28:44.359 align:start position:0%
him loose well now they have to go with
 
02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
the ice team into that neighborhood and
 
02:28:47.389 --> 02:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
that's really going to upset the
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood so I just feel like
 
02:28:51.230 --> 02:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes we we cut off our own nose to
 
02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
spread our face in those situations
 
02:28:54.269 --> 02:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
representative s will you raising your
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
hand representative janen first
 
02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman I I think at
 
02:29:02.910 --> 02:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
some point I know we're late in our
 
02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
session but uh it might be ho us to have
 
02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh maybe police standers and training
 
02:29:10.830 --> 02:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
pull a cruiser up with the spot terminal
 
02:29:13.469 --> 02:29:13.479 align:start position:0%
so we can all see what information's on
 
02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
there because we talked about bail we
 
02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
talked about uh domestic assault we
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
talked about all these other things one
 
02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
of the things that I remember remember
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh when I went through that process was
 
02:29:25.469 --> 02:29:25.479 align:start position:0%
if somebody's on probation or parole and
 
02:29:27.070 --> 02:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
you pull them over and have an encounter
 
02:29:29.429 --> 02:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
with them if they being supervised by a
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
probation or Pro parole officer um it'll
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
pop right up on the screen so if they
 
02:29:40.030 --> 02:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
committed a a a petty lashy or uh some
 
02:29:43.429 --> 02:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
minor crime um you immediately would
 
02:29:45.150 --> 02:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
hold them for 72 hours for that
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
probation officer so it's not like this
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
is a process that's not being used in
 
02:29:51.429 --> 02:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
our state
 
02:29:54.030 --> 02:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
already somebody tell me if I'm wrong I
 
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
believe that's what I was told 72-hour
 
02:29:57.469 --> 02:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
hold for anybody on probation parole
 
02:29:59.790 --> 02:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
that's committed another crime so we're
 
02:30:01.790 --> 02:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
already doing it for that I don't see
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
issue um representative Shake thank you
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
so I I have two separate things one is
 
02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
just a concern about the way in which
 
02:30:18.429 --> 02:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
this bill even is amended Limits The
 
02:30:22.590 --> 02:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
Power of a chief to determine how their
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
troops um behave at this you know when
 
02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
they detain someone whether how they how
 
02:30:29.710 --> 02:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
they what guidance they give and whether
 
02:30:32.190 --> 02:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
it would impact their ability to
 
02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
determine how their Department acts in
 
02:30:36.750 --> 02:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
these situations and the other thing is
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
just looking at the list of things that
 
02:30:41.110 --> 02:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
might exclude someone I think about
 
02:30:43.550 --> 02:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
someone who might have been the key
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
witness in a really horrific crime um
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
and maybe they were involved in another
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
crime in their previous country because
 
02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
maybe they were forced into a drug
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
cartel as a 12-year-old and you know as
 
02:30:58.150 --> 02:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
a result of fleeing their country to get
 
02:31:00.510 --> 02:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
out of that lifestyle are now here are
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
wanted for things in their home country
 
02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason but now they've been
 
02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
a witness to a major crime here and and
 
02:31:10.990 --> 02:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
by contacting ice we've now first of all
 
02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
disincentivized them from coming forward
 
02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
to speak about what they've witnessed
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
and and testifying against the
 
02:31:18.349 --> 02:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
perpetrator of a violent crime here and
 
02:31:21.750 --> 02:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
we've also um potenti ually lost them to
 
02:31:25.389 --> 02:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
ice to be you know dealt with however so
 
02:31:27.269 --> 02:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
that that crime ultimately is not
 
02:31:28.750 --> 02:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
prosecuted and the victims of those
 
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
crimes remain um un uncared for that's
 
02:31:34.750 --> 02:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
not the right word but
 
02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
unsatisfied thank you um in response to
 
02:31:38.870 --> 02:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
your first
 
02:31:42.590 --> 02:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
point unfortunately or or or fortunately
 
02:31:44.830 --> 02:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
actually more fortunately um towns and
 
02:31:46.429 --> 02:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
cities and municipalities don't have
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
walls around them and you know we are
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
local control State sometimes but we are
 
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
a Dylan's R State and when something
 
02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect your neighbors local
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
control makes sense but when something
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
you do affects the your neighbors in the
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
entire State that's not local control so
 
02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
a town saying we're not going to arrest
 
02:32:08.830 --> 02:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
people who may be dangerous or we're
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
going to let people who may be dangerous
 
02:32:12.670 --> 02:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
go that town doesn't keep them only in
 
02:32:15.070 --> 02:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
their borders so saying well a chief
 
02:32:16.750 --> 02:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
locally can't decide for his own town
 
02:32:18.030 --> 02:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
well he's not he's deciding for the
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
whole state because that person is free
 
02:32:23.469 --> 02:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
to move about the state um and secondly
 
02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
with regard to we do have in here that
 
02:32:29.469 --> 02:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
the people um the agencies will work
 
02:32:31.150 --> 02:32:31.160 align:start position:0%
with Federal immigration authorities to
 
02:32:32.830 --> 02:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
help ensure the availability of the
 
02:32:34.830 --> 02:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
person to participate in the prosecution
 
02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
of the State Crime Isis indicated that
 
02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
they will work with um they don't just
 
02:32:41.550 --> 02:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
fly right in and grab people out if
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
they're part of a crime they'll work
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office uh on
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
allowing that person to testify and
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
things of that nature they may even be
 
02:32:49.870 --> 02:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
able to work something out regarding the
 
02:32:53.469 --> 02:32:53.479 align:start position:0%
their their um status as being deported
 
02:32:56.910 --> 02:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
um but at the at the end of the day you
 
02:32:58.429 --> 02:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
know you've said that well what if they
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
were did a crime in their home country
 
02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
because you know they were forced into
 
02:33:04.070 --> 02:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
it on the other side of that coin we
 
02:33:06.830 --> 02:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
have the the the mass murderer and Ry
 
02:33:08.670 --> 02:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
who committed crimes in his State as
 
02:33:10.269 --> 02:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
part of some kind of corrupt government
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
scheme I think from what I read so you
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
don't know we don't know so we can't we
 
02:33:15.269 --> 02:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
have to first thing we have to do is
 
02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
protect our citizens representative
 
02:33:18.910 --> 02:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Mr chairman and this
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't ban
 
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know Peter bro has I think an
 
02:33:25.469 --> 02:33:25.479 align:start position:0%
ordinance or warrant article that says
 
02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
that we're a welcoming Community it's
 
02:33:29.030 --> 02:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
very Broad and the police chief still
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
works with the federal that does this
 
02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
does not ban uh those kind of Warren
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
articles it's only if uh municipality is
 
02:33:39.790 --> 02:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
refusing to comply with ice in the
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
federal government that's really all it
 
02:33:43.349 --> 02:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
does you can be welcoming you can help
 
02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
people get um Services you can help
 
02:33:47.469 --> 02:33:47.479 align:start position:0%
people find housing this has nothing to
 
02:33:48.990 --> 02:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
do with what you as a community want to
 
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
do except for unless you want to let
 
02:33:53.389 --> 02:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
people go who are wanted by the federal
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
government so all the churches that are
 
02:33:56.630 --> 02:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
doing the great work that came and said
 
02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
that they were doing the great work
 
02:33:59.389 --> 02:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
would impact them whatsoever absolutely
 
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
and the Immigrant communities that are
 
02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
here are still going to be able to and
 
02:34:04.110 --> 02:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like uh to bring up
 
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative selig's uh Point um that
 
02:34:09.070 --> 02:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
somebody in that situation would still
 
02:34:11.389 --> 02:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
be eligible for Asylum if they were if
 
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
they were wanted for for crimes or if
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
they were wanted by uh gang members in
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know say Nicaragua or one of the
 
02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
South American countries than than that
 
02:34:22.950 --> 02:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
is is uh eligible for Asylum as far as
 
02:34:25.269 --> 02:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
the Asylum courts would go and that this
 
02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply to that person I
 
02:34:28.349 --> 02:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate we're going to see a lot of
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
those from Haiti very soon if not
 
02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
already so um you in a second um
 
02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:34.510 align:start position:0%
already so um you in a second um
representative

02:34:34.510 --> 02:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:34:39.790 --> 02:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
Elber thank you Mr chair uh I am
 
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
wondering what the concerns you
 
02:34:47.630 --> 02:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
had uh with the amendment filed by
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative Muse that let you to
 
02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
decide that you wanted to have a
 
02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
different one there's some significant
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
overlaps and also some significant
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
differences significant departures um
 
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I I did read the amendment and I
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
chose not to recognize the amendment
 
02:35:05.269 --> 02:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
because it um it it totally undid
 
02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
everything really in my opinion what the
 
02:35:10.269 --> 02:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
bill was trying to do by allowing it um
 
02:35:13.150 --> 02:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
to be by allowing it to be a decision in
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
other words we're saying you can't make
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
this decision in the bill but that
 
02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment kind of says well you can kind
 
02:35:19.349 --> 02:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
of make that decision it just goes about
 
02:35:22.230 --> 02:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
it a different way um so I chose that to
 
02:35:28.469 --> 02:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:30.470 align:start position:0%
Balden I think
 
02:35:30.470 --> 02:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
Balden I think
[Music]

02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
um in regard to representative Wheeler's
 
02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:38.309 align:start position:0%
um in regard to representative Wheeler's
question

02:35:38.309 --> 02:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:35:42.429 --> 02:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
the there are sections of the bill
 
02:35:45.710 --> 02:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
unaffected by this amendment that say no
 
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
state government entity local government
 
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:49.800 align:start position:0%

02:35:52.950 --> 02:35:52.960 align:start position:0%

02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policy and Sanctuary policy is
 
02:36:06.110 --> 02:36:06.120 align:start position:0%

custom
 
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that it is the case that
 
02:36:13.429 --> 02:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
Peterboro could
 
02:36:15.550 --> 02:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
continue portraying itself as a
 
02:36:17.710 --> 02:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
welcoming keep reading you didn't finish
 
02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:20.120 align:start position:0%
reading your sentence it says is adopted
 
02:36:21.790 --> 02:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
or Allowed by a state entity or local
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
government which prohibits or impedes
 
02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency from complying
 
02:36:29.510 --> 02:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
with 8 USC 1373 which prohibits imped
 
02:36:31.070 --> 02:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency from
 
02:36:32.790 --> 02:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
communicating and cooperating it make
 
02:36:35.590 --> 02:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
sense that a custom that
 
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
impedes uh enforcement might be being a
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
welcoming town no that's a stretch I
 
02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
think I don't think so but um I'm just
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
the this I stopped reading the news a
 
02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
long time ago so I don't know about this
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
Mass killer but if that's one person
 
02:36:55.870 --> 02:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
what do we do with the far more than one
 
02:36:57.670 --> 02:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
person being human trafficked in the
 
02:37:03.030 --> 02:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire who is here um
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
illegally and doesn't want to be here um
 
02:37:09.630 --> 02:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
they would have detainer but is
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
terrified of we don't know why they
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
might or might not have an A detainer
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying is that this
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
seems like it does nothing for Vic
 
02:37:21.550 --> 02:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
victims of human trafficking nothing to
 
02:37:23.469 --> 02:37:23.479 align:start position:0%
encourage them to call and all that it
 
02:37:23.479 --> 02:37:25.349 align:start position:0%
encourage them to call and all that it
does

02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
is set the ex expectation and the
 
02:37:31.870 --> 02:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
standard that people who are brought
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
here against their will who are being
 
02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
human trafficked who are being raped
 
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't engage with law enforcement in
 
02:37:42.469 --> 02:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
any capacity and I it's just weird to me
 
02:37:45.990 --> 02:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
because we've passed other laws in this
 
02:37:48.349 --> 02:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
legislature in recent years to for
 
02:37:48.359 --> 02:37:50.349 align:start position:0%
legislature in recent years to for
example

02:37:50.349 --> 02:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:37:53.269 --> 02:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
encourage people voluntarily engaging in
 
02:37:55.389 --> 02:37:55.399 align:start position:0%
sex work in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
unrelated to ice or immigration or
 
02:38:00.670 --> 02:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
anything just everyday Granite Staters
 
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
um that if they're the victim of a crime
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
they should be able to report that crime
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
to police without fear of arrest why
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
aren't we going to give people
 
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
victimized through human trafficking the
 
02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:15.349 align:start position:0%
victimized through human trafficking the
same

02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:38:19.550 --> 02:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
benefit it's not the same benefit um
 
02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
someone who's involved in prostitution
 
02:38:23.950 --> 02:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
calling to say that they've been abused
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
so that they're not in fear of arrest of
 
02:38:27.269 --> 02:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
being prosecuted for
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
prostitution is nowhere near the same as
 
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
saying to someone who's here illegally
 
02:38:34.590 --> 02:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
we will not honor this ice detainer on
 
02:38:36.910 --> 02:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
you that says that you've committed a
 
02:38:38.910 --> 02:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
crime that makes you removable from this
 
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
country those two are not equal in any
 
02:38:43.790 --> 02:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
kind of way and furthermore if someone
 
02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
is being trafficked um ice itself has
 
02:38:50.269 --> 02:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
programs to help them but what we can't
 
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
do is say to ourselves you're setting
 
02:38:54.309 --> 02:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
ice up as some kind of evil entity that
 
02:38:56.110 --> 02:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
we mustn't cooperate with we mustn't
 
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
tell them what's going on we mustn't
 
02:38:59.150 --> 02:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
share information with them they're the
 
02:39:01.389 --> 02:39:01.399 align:start position:0%
bad guys setting up the Federal
 
02:39:03.910 --> 02:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
immigration as as an evil entity and
 
02:39:05.269 --> 02:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
where the good guys are going to protect
 
02:39:08.070 --> 02:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
you from them is a horrible precedent um
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
to say that to our citizens that well we
 
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
trust them sometimes sometimes we don't
 
02:39:16.070 --> 02:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
I mean um either we Mr chair I'm not
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
sure I would um you're kind of be saying
 
02:39:21.070 --> 02:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
that motivation what a motivation of
 
02:39:23.469 --> 02:39:23.479 align:start position:0%
another speaker is I don't I'm telling
 
02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
you exactly what I heard I heard that we
 
02:39:29.150 --> 02:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
speak to representative Roy motives
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
later on something else TI for Tat but
 
02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
yeah but but what I'm saying is if
 
02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
you're being human trafficked and you're
 
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and you're
 
02:39:41.110 --> 02:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
aware of people being um removed from
 
02:39:43.349 --> 02:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
the country due to immigration status
 
02:39:44.590 --> 02:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
and you don't even know where your
 
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
passport is because it was stolen from
 
02:39:47.950 --> 02:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
you are you going to engage with law
 
02:39:49.870 --> 02:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement to try to save your own life
 
02:39:50.910 --> 02:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
and the life of the people that are
 
02:39:53.429 --> 02:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
being trafficked with you mhm I highly
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
doubt that that's the function of
 
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
denying them the ability to access their
 
02:40:00.269 --> 02:40:00.279 align:start position:0%
own legal documents so I think that this
 
02:40:02.349 --> 02:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
sends a terrible message to victims of
 
02:40:04.510 --> 02:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
human trafficking and potentially
 
02:40:06.030 --> 02:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
emboldens human
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
traffickers perhaps I think we're going
 
02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
to have to disagree um I just don't see
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
it that way I see it as um protecting
 
02:40:15.670 --> 02:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
our own citizens and we can't be held
 
02:40:19.429 --> 02:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
hostage by human traffickers who are we
 
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
have to just not check anybody's status
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
because they might be human literally
 
02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
there's people being held hostage by
 
02:40:27.830 --> 02:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
human traffickers I know there are we as
 
02:40:31.150 --> 02:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
a committee we could join in and also be
 
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
held hostage as you're saying and at
 
02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
least stand with people being human
 
02:40:38.910 --> 02:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
trafficked and encourage them to engage
 
02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement so that they can be
 
02:40:43.550 --> 02:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
rescued and the people controlling their
 
02:40:46.110 --> 02:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
bodies can be held to account but this
 
02:40:47.790 --> 02:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
seems to send us in the opposite
 
02:40:49.429 --> 02:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
direction where we're driving a wedge
 
02:40:51.469 --> 02:40:51.479 align:start position:0%
between victims and police where they
 
02:40:54.670 --> 02:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to cooperate I disagree um
 
02:40:57.070 --> 02:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you Mr
 
02:40:59.389 --> 02:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
chairman how much experience do you have
 
02:41:01.950 --> 02:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
with the Immigrant Community do you um
 
02:41:04.469 --> 02:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
do volunteer work or are these all
 
02:41:07.230 --> 02:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
hypothetical situations that are holding
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
up everybody's time thank
 
02:41:13.870 --> 02:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
you is that directed at me
 
02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:15.389 align:start position:0%
you is that directed at me
exclusively

02:41:15.389 --> 02:41:15.399 align:start position:0%
exclusively
 
02:41:18.429 --> 02:41:18.439 align:start position:0%
CH Meo yeah so I have a lot of
 
02:41:23.230 --> 02:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
englishan is that experience we can all
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
speak a different language we won't know
 
02:41:28.910 --> 02:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
the hell's going on representative go
 
02:41:30.309 --> 02:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
ahead representative I would also like
 
02:41:32.389 --> 02:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
to that question was out of line go
 
02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
ahead what I just want to note um in
 
02:41:36.070 --> 02:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
light of kind of this this conversation
 
02:41:38.670 --> 02:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
here is that
 
02:41:42.990 --> 02:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
um policies like this make it so that
 
02:41:45.630 --> 02:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
you do not speak in specifics because if
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
you speak in specifics about your
 
02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
specific uh exper experience or an
 
02:41:52.990 --> 02:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
individual uh experience with an
 
02:41:54.349 --> 02:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
individual who may be put in that
 
02:41:56.309 --> 02:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
situation you put that person in danger
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
so I just want to call that out because
 
02:42:00.030 --> 02:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's very difficult to have a
 
02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
conversation and speaking about specific
 
02:42:04.630 --> 02:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
stories or even being able to engage
 
02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
with people who may be able to help that
 
02:42:09.309 --> 02:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
person all right and so I I'm going to
 
02:42:11.950 --> 02:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
put out a hypothetical because I can't
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
possibly um uh endanger someone uh whose
 
02:42:21.070 --> 02:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
whose uh situation I been entrusted with
 
02:42:22.750 --> 02:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
okay so like there yes there are many
 
02:42:24.590 --> 02:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
situations you cannot speak specifically
 
02:42:27.309 --> 02:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
about them particularly and specifically
 
02:42:30.349 --> 02:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
because things like this make you afraid
 
02:42:33.309 --> 02:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
that in speaking about them specifically
 
02:42:36.030 --> 02:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
you are going to put them in danger I'm
 
02:42:37.990 --> 02:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
not entirely sure what you just said but
 
02:42:40.990 --> 02:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
I think I think you meant that you uh
 
02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
she's using hypotheticals because if she
 
02:42:45.309 --> 02:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
said a specific case it would put
 
02:42:46.830 --> 02:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
somebody in danger and I don't think
 
02:42:48.670 --> 02:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
that's what the question was out of
 
02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
order anyway representative um Muse I'm
 
02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
about to um call the unless you have
 
02:42:54.110 --> 02:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
something very important to say I think
 
02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
we've beaten this pretty
 
02:42:58.150 --> 02:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
much I just wanted to say that you know
 
02:43:00.510 --> 02:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
I I just want to acknowledge this is a a
 
02:43:02.269 --> 02:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
super complicated issue with a lot of
 
02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
implications for law enforcement with uh
 
02:43:08.590 --> 02:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
implications for our immigrant Community
 
02:43:10.150 --> 02:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
um it it's
 
02:43:12.309 --> 02:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
complicated and and I just think it's
 
02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
important for us to go um not only on
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
the best information we have but on on
 
02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
accurate information so on the on the
 
02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
ice website um essentially what it says
 
02:43:27.710 --> 02:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
is a detainer uh isn't probable cause
 
02:43:29.269 --> 02:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
that a crime has been committed and I'll
 
02:43:31.790 --> 02:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
read you exactly what they say ice
 
02:43:33.790 --> 02:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
issues detainers based on a finding by a
 
02:43:35.910 --> 02:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
trained immigration officer that there
 
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
is probable cause to believe an
 
02:43:40.950 --> 02:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
individual as a removable
 
02:43:43.550 --> 02:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
noncitizen it's not probable cause that
 
02:43:46.590 --> 02:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
they created murder or they created or
 
02:43:49.150 --> 02:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
that they that they committed a crime
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
it's probable caused by an immigration
 
02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
officer not a judge that they're in the
 
02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:53.990 align:start position:0%
officer not a judge that they're in the
country

02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:43:57.309 --> 02:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
illegally that that is what the a
 
02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
detainer is so there have been you know
 
02:44:03.870 --> 02:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of our conversation has involved
 
02:44:06.349 --> 02:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
equivocating uh detainers with things
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
like arrest warrants from out of States
 
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
other states this this really is a
 
02:44:13.630 --> 02:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
different animal and and I think it's
 
02:44:16.269 --> 02:44:16.279 align:start position:0%
something that is important enough to be
 
02:44:17.870 --> 02:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
approached more carefully than we're
 
02:44:19.309 --> 02:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
approaching it in this bill the
 
02:44:20.910 --> 02:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
amendment it's not that there isn't
 
02:44:23.510 --> 02:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
anything here that's worth doing I think
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
there absolutely is I think that it
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
would be a great thing if we had
 
02:44:29.469 --> 02:44:29.479 align:start position:0%
clarification for our communities
 
02:44:31.309 --> 02:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
clarification for law enforcement and
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
clarification on these issues for
 
02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
immigrant communities I just don't think
 
02:44:37.630 --> 02:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
that this is the way to do
 
02:44:39.870 --> 02:44:39.880 align:start position:0%

bill um as someone formerly employed by
 
02:49:49.510 --> 02:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire DCF I follow the that YDC
 
02:49:52.110 --> 02:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
case closely and I'm appalled as I think
 
02:49:55.229 --> 02:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
we all should be by the level of abuse
 
02:49:57.469 --> 02:49:57.479 align:start position:0%
that was allowed to go on there I'm
 
02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
profoundly saddened by the trauma that
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
these victims experience as a result of
 
02:50:04.710 --> 02:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
both the abuse and the court action that
 
02:50:06.910 --> 02:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
followed there will forever be a black
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
mark on the state of New Hampshire for
 
02:50:10.469 --> 02:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
its failure to protect over a thousand
 
02:50:12.870 --> 02:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
of our most vulnerable citizens despite
 
02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
their pleas for help and the protection
 
02:50:17.070 --> 02:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
that they most assuredly deserved and
 
02:50:19.150 --> 02:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
should have been able to expect
 
02:50:20.710 --> 02:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
knowing that there's no amount of money
 
02:50:22.429 --> 02:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
that will give these victims their lives
 
02:50:24.510 --> 02:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
back who they would have been had they
 
02:50:26.269 --> 02:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
not been repeatedly victimized while in
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
state custody supporting this
 
02:50:30.590 --> 02:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
legislation while an attempt to protect
 
02:50:32.469 --> 02:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
the financial health of the State of New
 
02:50:35.030 --> 02:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does little really to truly
 
02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
compensate these individuals and nothing
 
02:50:39.590 --> 02:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure that this never happens again
 
02:50:41.469 --> 02:50:41.479 align:start position:0%
that said I recognize and appreciate the
 
02:50:44.070 --> 02:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
efforts of all who've worked um to come
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
to some level of agreement to provide
 
02:50:48.269 --> 02:50:48.279 align:start position:0%
what victims likely still feel is it
 
02:50:51.030 --> 02:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
woeful y inadequate compensation I will
 
02:50:53.229 --> 02:50:53.239 align:start position:0%

02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:55.000 align:start position:0%

03:06:35.790 --> 03:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
03:06:39.150 --> 03:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
shortly this bill um will give us a
 
03:06:41.590 --> 03:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
report to make sure that in the future
 
03:06:45.710 --> 03:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
we uh release videotapes of uh police
 
03:06:48.790 --> 03:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
War cameras in the proper manner uh
 
03:06:50.790 --> 03:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
there is a proper way of doing it and an
 
03:06:52.510 --> 03:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
important reason for both sides to have
 
03:06:54.229 --> 03:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
the information but uh there's concern
 
03:06:56.309 --> 03:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
about it getting online or out of the
 
03:06:58.269 --> 03:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
proper hands so this report would be
 
03:06:58.279 --> 03:07:01.229 align:start position:0%
proper hands so this report would be
very

03:07:01.229 --> 03:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:02.990 --> 03:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
important would you like to speak to you
 
03:07:05.590 --> 03:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
a second no thank you Mr chairman
 
03:07:07.070 --> 03:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
represent wheeler thank you Mr chairman
 
03:07:08.150 --> 03:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would really quickly
 
03:07:09.990 --> 03:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
have to add is for the record I hope
 
03:07:11.870 --> 03:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
that we next year would be able to come
 
03:07:13.510 --> 03:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
back and update the body camera statute
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
so that defense Council are able to uh
 
03:07:18.389 --> 03:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have that for their
 
03:07:21.229 --> 03:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
trials yeah I I think an important thing
 
03:07:23.990 --> 03:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
about this um bill is by the time we get
 
03:07:26.269 --> 03:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
to the legislation next year that this
 
03:07:28.630 --> 03:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
is going to drive where all the other
 
03:07:30.590 --> 03:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
people get to weigh in well law
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement won't be having to think
 
03:07:33.389 --> 03:07:33.399 align:start position:0%
about it we've already got their
 
03:07:36.309 --> 03:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
position so now we can focus on you know
 
03:07:38.229 --> 03:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
what the ACLU position is the defense
 
03:07:40.229 --> 03:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
Council position is law enforcement will
 
03:07:41.870 --> 03:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
have laid their position in stone so we
 
03:07:44.030 --> 03:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
know what it is um did you have your
 
03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
hand up representative man yes thank you
 
03:07:46.720 --> 03:07:48.229 align:start position:0%
hand up representative man yes thank you
so

03:07:48.229 --> 03:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:49.469 --> 03:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
I I may have told this before this is in
 
03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
my wheelhouse this is what I currently
 
03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
do in my capacity as a la officer is
 
03:07:57.150 --> 03:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
body cameras so when I first saw the law
 
03:07:58.670 --> 03:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
I thought this wasn't written by police
 
03:08:01.030 --> 03:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
officers it's it's it's just all over
 
03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
the place um there is case law now aomar
 
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
Amic Superior Court saying that you must
 
03:08:07.550 --> 03:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
provide a hard copy to defense so that's
 
03:08:09.670 --> 03:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
being done I understand the concern is
 
03:08:11.710 --> 03:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
is what's being done with it after that
 
03:08:13.150 --> 03:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
because we can't monitor it we can't
 
03:08:14.110 --> 03:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
prevent it from being released on
 
03:08:15.830 --> 03:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
YouTube there has to be something to put
 
03:08:18.349 --> 03:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
in place so I think there's a lot of
 
03:08:19.309 --> 03:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
work that has to be done with the
 
03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
statute it has some issues with it and I
 
03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
think having a law
 
03:08:26.910 --> 03:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement um voice in it to to to
 
03:08:29.190 --> 03:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
draft some legislation is a good idea
 
03:08:30.510 --> 03:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
and then it will come probably back to
 
03:08:32.590 --> 03:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
this body for all of us to weigh in on
 
03:08:35.469 --> 03:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
it thank you yeah absolutely it will and
 
03:08:38.030 --> 03:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
and to your point about the case law
 
03:08:40.229 --> 03:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's not a good thing when the court has
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
to torture itself around our statutes to
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
do the right thing so we need to let
 
03:08:46.950 --> 03:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
them untwist that knot they've made and
 
03:08:48.710 --> 03:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
and let it be in statute that they can
 
03:08:51.469 --> 03:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
provide that representative sake thank
 
03:08:53.469 --> 03:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
you I just want to say I think having
 
03:08:56.269 --> 03:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
more data is a good thing and having
 
03:08:58.269 --> 03:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
clear and specific data allows us to
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
make the most informed decisions which
 
03:09:03.030 --> 03:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
is crucial agreed and we may not agree
 
03:09:04.510 --> 03:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
with the law enforcement position but at
 
03:09:05.710 --> 03:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
least we'll know what it is when it gets
 
03:09:08.550 --> 03:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
here representative zitec uh Mr chairman
 
03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
I came in late for the U the that
 
03:09:15.389 --> 03:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
testimony did merac County weigh were
 
03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
they in favor of this bill they were um
 
03:09:18.990 --> 03:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
they would have liked to see it go a
 
03:09:20.710 --> 03:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
little further but they said it's a good
 
03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:22.910 align:start position:0%
little further but they said it's a good
start

03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
start
 
03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
and representative M yeah one thing I
 
03:09:28.269 --> 03:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out is the effective um
 
03:09:30.229 --> 03:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
the the date that the report is actually
 
03:09:32.190 --> 03:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
due is November 1st
 
03:09:35.670 --> 03:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
2024 um if you're familiar with our bill
 
03:09:37.950 --> 03:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
filing deadlines in the house um those
 
03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
can be kind of all over the place
 
03:09:42.070 --> 03:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes well before that date um
 
03:09:45.030 --> 03:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes not too long afterwards so
 
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
even in a best case scenario situation
 
03:09:51.110 --> 03:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't allow um much time to have uh
 
03:09:53.229 --> 03:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
legislation drafted and to actually get
 
03:09:55.429 --> 03:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
that kind of input once this committee
 
03:09:57.950 --> 03:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
makes a recommendation so I I'll support
 
03:09:59.550 --> 03:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
the bill because I think it's it's good
 
03:10:04.229 --> 03:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
work to do but um I would encourage um
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh Lea to make their report uh available
 
03:10:09.510 --> 03:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
well before the 1 of
 
03:10:12.150 --> 03:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
November thank you um and as a member of
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
that commission I will take that to them
 
03:10:15.950 --> 03:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
and let them know that they if they want
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
this input to be taken and I would also
 
03:10:19.710 --> 03:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
encourage someone if they want to file a
 
03:10:21.670 --> 03:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
bill and we'll fill in the blanks with
 
03:10:24.190 --> 03:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
this when we get it representative s
 
03:10:25.750 --> 03:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank thank you just to that point my
 
03:10:27.190 --> 03:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is the Senate's deadlines
 
03:10:30.469 --> 03:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
are later so um maybe the intent is that
 
03:10:32.510 --> 03:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate would be the one to provide
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
the bill for quite possibly yeah either
 
03:10:37.269 --> 03:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
or we'll figure out a way representative
 
03:10:40.269 --> 03:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
scitec just asking but uh can't you
 
03:10:42.750 --> 03:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
introduce the non gerain Amendment
 
03:10:45.670 --> 03:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
anytime absolutely you can if that those
 
03:10:47.469 --> 03:10:47.479 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily go always the way you
 
03:10:50.150 --> 03:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
want but yes we could if we were to find
 
03:10:53.910 --> 03:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
another bill um representative Murphy
 
03:10:55.030 --> 03:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I actually just have a
 
03:10:58.229 --> 03:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
question about the fiscal note um I'm
 
03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
not sure if the fiscal note is was for
 
03:11:05.870 --> 03:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
as introduced or because it talks about
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
it requires an additional full-time
 
03:11:12.429 --> 03:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
position and I don't does that it sounds
 
03:11:14.590 --> 03:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
like it was as introduced because it I
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
believe it was changed just to make this
 
03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh be assigned to Lee act for their
 
03:11:22.349 --> 03:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
drafting purpos yeah that that that
 
03:11:24.229 --> 03:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply to the amended version of
 
03:11:27.150 --> 03:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
the bill because they don't have the
 
03:11:29.229 --> 03:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
ability to have a full-time person or
 
03:11:31.990 --> 03:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
just a commission so I don't I believe
 
03:11:34.349 --> 03:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
that was probably the original fiscal no
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you okay with that I would ask
 
03:11:38.110 --> 03:11:38.120 align:start position:0%

Wednesday thank you everyone I know
 
03:14:08.910 --> 03:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
today was pretty contentious on some of
 
03:14:10.590 --> 03:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
the bills but no one seems to be
 
03:14:12.150 --> 03:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
bleeding so that's always a good sign
 
03:14:14.389 --> 03:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative s thank you um just I
 
03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
passed out thinking we were going to get
 
03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
to it an amendment for five
 
03:14:19.429 --> 03:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
that is a Germain amendment that
 
03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
corrects language so if everybody could
 
03:14:22.950 --> 03:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
make sure to keep their copy safe
 
03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
because um I passed them all out the
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
non- Germain Amendment we're going to
 
03:14:27.630 --> 03:14:27.640 align:start position:0%
hear does not affect the underlying bill
 
03:14:29.630 --> 03:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
so it will go as planned I just want to
 
03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
